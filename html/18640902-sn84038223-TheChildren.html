That meet me each morn at the door!<br/>
I shall miss the &quot;good-nights,&quot; and the kisses,<br/>
And the gush of their innocent glee,<br/>
The group on the green, and the flowers<br/>
That are brought every morning for me.<br/>

I shall miss them at morn and at eve—<br/>
Their song in the school and the street;<br/>
