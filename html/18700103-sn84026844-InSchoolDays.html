IN SCHOOL DAYS.<br/>
BY JOHN G- WHITTIER.<br/>
Still sits the school house by the road,<br/>
A ragged beggar sunning ;<br/>
Around it still the sumac grow,<br/>
And blackberry vines are running.<br/>
Within, the master&#x27;s desk is seen,<br/>
Deep scarred by rads official;<br/>
The warping floor, the battered seats,<br/>
The jack knife&#x27;s carved initial.<br/>
The charcoal frescoes on its wall;<br/>
Its door’s worn stilt betraying<br/>
The feet that creeping slow to school,<br/>
Went storming out t&lt;^ playing.<br/>
Long years ago a winter sun<br/>
Shone over it at setting ;<br/>
Lit up its western window panes,<br/>
And low eaves’ icy fretting.<br/>
It touched the golden tangled curls,<br/>
And brown eyes full of grieving,<br/>
Of one who still her steps delayed<br/>
When all the school were leaving.<br/>
For near he stood the littlaboy<br/>
Her childish favor singled ;<br/>
His cap pulled down unon a face<br/>
Where pride and shame were mingled.<br/>
Fushing with restless feet the snow<br/>
To right and left, he lingered;<br/>
As restlessly her tiny hands<br/>
The blue cheeked apron fingered.<br/>
lie saw her lift her eyes : and felt<br/>
The soft hand’s light caressing<br/>
And heard the tremble of a voice<br/>
As if a fault confessing.<br/>
“1&#x27;in sorry that I spelt tlie word ;<br/>
I hate to go above you<br/>
Because”—the brown eyes lower fell<br/>
“Because, you see I love you.”<br/>
Still memory to a gray-haired man<br/>
