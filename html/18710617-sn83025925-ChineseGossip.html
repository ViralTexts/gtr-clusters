The young lady in question is an exceedingly stylish and handsome brunette, who has been splendidly educated at the Georgetown Convent, where she graduated about a year ago. Since that time she has been the sole mistress of her father&#x27;s elegant and aristocratic mansion near Murray Hill.<br/>
<br/>
The young lady is motherless, and an only child. She has been indulged in every whim by her fond father, who is immensely proud of his daughter&#x27;s beauty and accomplishments. About six months ago the father took into the household as butler or steward a remarkably clever and intelligent China-man. &quot;Cat-like, dreamy-eyed, yellow, and slim,&quot; the new butler performed his duties admirably.
