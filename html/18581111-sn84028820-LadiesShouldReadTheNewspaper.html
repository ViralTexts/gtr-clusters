Wht Women Should Read Newspa<br/>
pers. It is a great mistake in female ed­<br/>
ucation to keep a young lady&#x27;s time and<br/>
attention devoted to only the fashionable<br/>
litorature of the day. If you would qual­<br/>
ify her for conversation, you must give<br/>
her something to talk about give her ed<br/>
ucation with the actual world and its<br/>
transpiring events. Urge ugon her to<br/>
read the newspapers and become familiar<br/>
with the present character and improve<br/>
ment of our race. History is some im<br/>
portance; but the past world is dead, and<br/>
we have nothing to do with it.<br/>
Our thoughts and our concerns should<br/>
be for the present world, to know what it<br/>
is. Iet her have an intelligent opinion<br/>
and be able to sustain an intelligent con<br/>
versation concerning the mental, moral,<br/>
political, nnd religious improvement of<br/>
the times. Let the gilded annuals and<br/>
poems on the centre table lie kept a part<br/>
of the time oovered with good weekly and<br/>
daily lournats. let tbe whole family<br/>
