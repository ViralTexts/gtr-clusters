<br/>
A gentleman who keeps the run of facts, figures, and babies, has just laid before &quot;an inquiring world&quot; the following statistics:<br/>
<br/>
The whole number of languages spoken in the world amount to 3,064; viz., 587 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.—The inhabitants of our globe profess more than 1,000 different religions. The number of men is about equal to the number of women. The average of human life is about 33 years. One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years, one half before reaching 17 years of age, and those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) refused to one half the human species. To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100 years of age; to every 100, only six reach the age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of age. <br/>
<br/>
There are on the earth, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333 die every year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every hour, 60 every minute, or 1 every second. These losses are about balanced by an equal number of births. The married are longer lived than single, and, above all, those who observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall men live longer than short ones! Women have more chances of life in their favor previous to being 50 years of age than men, but fewer afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
The number of marriages is in proportion of 175 to 1,000 individuals. Marriages are more frequent after the equinoxes—that is during the months of June and December. Those born in the spring are generally more robust than others. Births and deaths are more frequent by night than by day. The number of men capable of working or bearing arms, is calculated at one-fourth of the population.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these statements are rather singular, and yet many of them are susceptible of an easy solution. That marriages take place more frequently in June and December, than other months of the year, was just what we have always suspected was the case. Those who marry in June, do so because they can&#x27;t help it; while those who connubialize in December, do so doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows which distinguish the frost-bitten months of winter. Those matches which come off in June are commonly love-matches, and are brought about by green fields, and the contagious influence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while those which happen in December are brought about in a great degree by mixing plain mathematics with the market value of flannel undergarments.<br/>

Interesting Miscellany—Interesting Statis­<br/>
tics. —A gentleman who keeps the run of facts<br/>
figures and babies, has just laid before &quot;an in­<br/>
quiring world&quot; the following statistics:<br/>
The whole number of languages spoken in<br/>
the world amount to 3064, viz : 586 in Europe,<br/>
937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1364 in Ameri­<br/>
ca. The inhabitants of our globe profess more<br/>
than 1000 different religions. The number of<br/>
men is about equal to the number of women.<br/>
The average of human life is about 33 years.<br/>
One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years,<br/>
one half before reaching 17 years of age, and<br/>
those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) re­<br/>
fused to ojie half the human species. To every<br/>
1000 persons, only one reaches 100 years of<br/>
age; to every one hundred only six reach the<br/>
age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to<br/>
80 years of age.<br/>
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 inhabi­<br/>
tants, and of these 333 ,333,333 die every year,<br/>
91,324 evéry day, 3730 every hour, 60 every<br/>
minute, or 1 every second. The losses are<br/>
about balanced by an equal number of births.<br/>
The married are longer-lived than the single,<br/>
and above all, those who observea sober and in­<br/>
dustrious conduct. Tall men live longer than<br/>
short ones! Women have more chances of life<br/>
in their favor previous to being 50 years of age,<br/>
than men, but fewer afterwards.<br/>
The number of marriages is in proportion of<br/>
175 to every 1000 individuals. Marriages are<br/>
more frequent after the equinoxes—that is,<br/>
during the months of June and December.<br/>
Those born in the spring are generally more<br/>
robust than others. Births and deaths are more<br/>
frequent by night than by day. The number<br/>
of men capable of working or bearing arms is<br/>
calculated at one-fourth of the population.<br/>
Some of these statements are rather singu­<br/>
lar, and yet many of them are susceptible of an<br/>
easy solution. That marriages take place more<br/>
frequently in June and December, than other<br/>
months of the year, was just what we have al­<br/>
ways suspected was the case. Those who mar­<br/>
ry in June, do so because they can&#x27;t help it;<br/>
while those who connubiaiize in December do<br/>
so, doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows<br/>
which distinguish the frost-bitten months of<br/>
winter. The matches which come off in June<br/>
are commonly love matches, and are brought<br/>
about by green fields and the contagious influ­<br/>

ing Statistics.—A gentleman who keeps<br/>
the run of facts, figures and fables, has<br/>
just I Rid before “an enquiring world” the<br/>
following statistics:<br/>
The whole number of languages spoken<br/>
in the world amount to 3064; viz, 587 in<br/>
Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and<br/>
1364 in America. The inhabitants of our<br/>
globe profess more than 1000 different<br/>
religions The number of men is about<br/>
equal to the number of women. Ihe<br/>
average of human life is about 83 years.<br/>
One-fourth die previous to 7 years, one­<br/>
half before reaching 17 years of age, and<br/>
those who pass that age enjoy a felicity<br/>
(?) refused to one-half of the human<br/>
species. To every 1000 persons, only<br/>
one reaches one hundred years of age; to<br/>
every 100 only six reaches the age of<br/>
sixty-six, and not more than one in 500<br/>
live to eighty years of age.<br/>
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 of<br/>
inhabitants, and of these 333,333,833 die<br/>
every year, 91,424 every day, 3830 every<br/>
hour, 60 every minute, and 1 every second.<br/>
These losses are about balanced by an<br/>
eq al number of births. The married<br/>
are longer-lived than the single, and<br/>
above nil, those who observe a sober and<br/>
industrious conduct. Tail men live lon­<br/>
ger than short ones! Women have more<br/>
chances of life in their favour previous to<br/>
being 50 years of age, then men, but fewer<br/>
afterwards.<br/>
The number of marriages is in propor­<br/>
tion to 175 to tevery 1000 individuals,—<br/>
Marriages are more frequent alter the<br/>
equinoxes —that is, during the months of<br/>
June and December.<br/>
Those born in the spring are generally<br/>
more robust than others. Births and<br/>
deaths are more frequent by night than<br/>
by tiny. The number of men capable of<br/>
working or bearing arms is calculated at<br/>
one-fourth of the population.<br/>
Some of these statements are rather<br/>
singular, and yet many of them are sus­<br/>
ceptible of an easy solution. 1 hat mar­<br/>
riages take place more frequently in June<br/>
and December than other months of the<br/>
year, was just what we have always ex­<br/>
pected was the case. Those who marry<br/>
in .June* do so because they can’t help it;<br/>
while thogfe who (Srthntlbialize in Decem­<br/>
ber, do so doubtless to guard against the<br/>
chilly pillows which distinguish the frost­<br/>
bitten months of winter. The matches<br/>
which come off in June are brought about<br/>
by green fields and the contagious in­<br/>
fluence of bobolinks and yellow-birds;<br/>
while those which happen in December<br/>
are brought about, in a degree, by mixing<br/>

singular, and yet many of them are sus­<br/>
ceptible of an easy solution. That mar­<br/>
riages take place more frequently in<br/>
June and December, than other mouths<br/>
of the year, was what we always suspec­<br/>
ted was the case. Those who marry in<br/>
June do so because they caut holp it,<br/>
while those who connubialize in Decem­<br/>
ber, do so, doubtless, to guard against<br/>
the ehilly pillows which distinguish the<br/>
