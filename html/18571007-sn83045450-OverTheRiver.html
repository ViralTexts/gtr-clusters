Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen<br/>
shore,<br/>
They watch, and beckon, and wait for<br/>
me.<br/>
And I sit and think when the sunset&#x27;s gold<br/>
Is flushing river, and hill, and shore,<br/>
I shall one day stand by the water cold,<br/>
And list for the sound of the boatman&#x27;s<br/>
oar:<br/>
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping<br/>
sail;<br/>
I shall hear the boat as it gains the<br/>
strand;<br/>
I shall pass from sight with the boatman<br/>
pale<br/>
To the better shores of the spirit-land.<br/>
I shall know the loved who have gone<br/>
before,<br/>
And joyfull</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/iune_cinnabar_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn90053049%2F00332897913%2F1897012301%2F0957.jp2/pct:32.060640,40.028129,12.338574,21.761603/!600,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />

For none return from those quiet shores,<br/>
Who cross with the boatman cold and<br/>
<br/>
pale;<br/>
We hear the dip of the golden oars,<br/>
And catch a gleam of the snowy sail;<br/>
And lo! they have passed from our yearning<br/>
hearts,<br/>
They cross the stream and are gone for aye.<br/>
We may not sunder the vail apart<br/>
That hides from our vision the gates of<br/>
day;<br/>
We oniy know that their barks no more<br/>
May sail with us o’er life’s stormy sea;<br/>
Yet somewhere [ know on the unseen shore,<br/>
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.<br/>
