<br/>
1. Wearing of thin shoes and cotton stockings on damp nights, and in cool rainy weather. Wearing insufficient clothing, and especially upon the limbs and extremities.<br/>
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid laziness, and keeping the mind in an unnatural state of excitement by reading trashy novels. Going to theaters, parties, and balls in all sorts of weather, in the thinnest possible dress. Dancing, till in a complete prespiration [sic], and then going home without sufficient over-garments, through the cool, damp air. <br/>
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven-by-nine bed rooms, without ventilation at the top of the windows, and especially with two or more persons in the same small, unventilated bed-room.<br/>
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating dinners. Eating in a hurry, without half masticating your food, and eating heartily before going to bed every night, when the mind and body are exhausted by the toils of the day, and the excitement of the evening.<br/>
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and coffee, and going from one step to another chewing and smoking tobacco, and drinking intoxicating liquors. By personal abuse, and physical and mental excesses of every description.<br/>
6. Marrying in haste and getting an uncongenial companion, and living the remainder of life in mental dissatisfaction. Cultivating jealousies and domestic broils, and being always in mental ferment.<br/>
7. Keeping children quiet by giving paregoric and cordials, by teaching them to suck candy, and by supplying them with raisins, nut, and rich cake. When they are sick, by giving them *mercury, tartar emetic*, and *arsenic*, under the mistaken notion that they are medicines, and not irritant poisons. <br/>
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb our minds, so as to leave no time to attend our health. Following an unhealthy occupation because money can be made by it.<br/>
9. Tempting the appetite with bitters and niceties, when the stomach says No, and by forcing food when nature does not demand and even rejects it. Gormandizing between meals.<br/>
10. Contriving to keep in a continual worry about something or nothing. Giving way to fits of anger. <br/>
11. Being irregular in all our habits of sleeping or eating, going to bed at midnight and getting up at noon.—Eating too much, too many kinds of food, and that which is too highly seasoned.<br/>
12. Neglecting to take proper care of ourselves, and not apply early for medical advise [sic] when disease first appears. Taking celebrated quack medicines to a degree of making a drug shop of the body.<br/>
<br/>
The above causes produce more sickness, suffering, and death, than all epidemics, malaria and contagion, combined with war, pestilence and famine. Nearly all who have attained an old age have been remarkable for equinimity of temper, correct habits of diet, drink, and rest—for temperance, cheerfulness, and morality. Physical punishment is sure to visit the transgressor of nature&#x27;s laws. All commit suicide, and cut off many years of their natural life, who do not observe the means for preventing disease, and of preserving health.—*American Medical and Surg. Journal*.<br/>

of weather, in the thinnest possible dress.<br/>
Dancing till in a complete perspiration, and<br/>
then going homo without sufficientover-garments<br/>
through tho cool, damp air.<br/>
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven by<br/>
nino bed-rooms, without ventilation at tho<br/>
top of tho windows, and especially with two<br/>
or more persons in tho same small, unventi­<br/>
lated bed-room.<br/>
4. Surfeiting on hot and stimulating din­<br/>
ners. Eating in a hurry, and not half masti­<br/>
cating the food. Eating heartily before go­<br/>
ing to bed every night, when tho mind and<br/>
body are exhausted by tho toils of tho day<br/>

and keeping the mind in an unnatural state of ex¬<br/>
citement by reading trashy novels. Going to thea¬<br/>

4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating dinners.<br/>
Eating in a hurry, without half masticating your<br/>
food, and eating heartily before going&#x27;to bed every<br/>

the toils of the day and the excitement of the even¬<br/>
<br/>
ing.<br/>
<br/>
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and coffee, and<br/>
going from one step to another, through chewing<br/>

12 WAYS OF SHORTENING LIFE,<br/>
<br/>
1. Weartne of thin shoes and cotton stockings<br/>
on damp nights and in cool, rainy weather.<br/>
Wearing insufficient clothing, and especially upon<br/>
the limbs and extremities.<br/>
<br/>
2. Leading a life of unfeeling, stupid laziness,<br/>
and keeping the mind in an unnatural state of<br/>
excitement by reading trashy novels. Going to<br/>
theaters, parties, and balls in all sorts of weather,<br/>
in the thinnest possible dress. Dancing till in a<br/>
complete perspiration, end then going home with-<br/>
out sufficient over-garments through the cool,<br/>
damp air.<br/>
<br/>
8. Sleeping in feather beds in seven-by-nine<br/>
bedrooms, without ventilation at the top of the<br/>
windows, and especially with two or more persons<br/>
in the same unventilated bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating din-<br/>
ners. Eating in a hurry, without half masti-<br/>
eating your food, and eating heartily just before<br/>
going to bed every night, when the mind and<br/>
body are exhausted by the toils of the day and<br/>
the excitement of the evening.<br/>
<br/>
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and coffee,<br/>
and going from one step to another, through<br/>
chewing and smoking tobacco, and drinking in-<br/>
toxicating liquors, by personal abuse and physical<br/>
excesses of every description.<br/>
<br/>
6. Marrying in haste and getting an uncon-<br/>
genial com » and living the remainder of<br/>
life in mental dissatisfaction. Cultivating jeal-<br/>
ousies and domestic broils, and being always in<br/>
mental ferment.<br/>
<br/>
7. Keeping children quiet by giving paregoric<br/>
and cordials; by teaching them to suck candy,<br/>
and by supplying them with raisins, nuts, and<br/>
rich cake. When they are sick, by giving them<br/>
mercury, tartar emetic, and arsenic, under the<br/>
mistaken notion that they are medicines, and not<br/>
irritant poisons.<br/>
<br/>
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb our<br/>
minds, so as to leave no time to attend to our<br/>
health. Following an unhealthy occupation be-<br/>
cause money can be made by it.<br/>
<br/>
9. Tempting the appetite with bitters and nice-<br/>
ties, when the stomach says, No, and by forcing<br/>
food. when nature does not demand, and even<br/>
rejects it. Gormandizing between meals. Using<br/>
tobacco and stimulants.<br/>
<br/>
10. Contriving to keep a continual worry about<br/>
something or nothing. Giving way to fits of<br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
11. Being irregular in all our habits of eatin,<br/>
and saseping 3 going to bed at midnight and a<br/>
ting up at noon. Eating too much and too many<br/>
ae of food, and that which is too highly seas-<br/>
<br/>
12. Neglecting to take care of ourselves,<br/>
and not applying early for medicinal advice when<br/>
disease first appears, Taking celebrated quack<br/>
medicines to a degree of making a drug-shop of<br/>
the body.<br/>
<br/>
The above causes produce more sickness, suf-<br/>
fering, and death than all the epidemics, malaria,<br/>
and contagion combined with war, pestilence,<br/>
and famine. Nearly all who have attained to old<br/>
<br/>
age have been remarkable for equanimity of<br/>
| temper, correct habits of diet, drink, and rest —<br/>
<br/>
. for temperance, cheerfulness, and morality. Phy-<br/>
sical is sure to visit the tran<br/>
<br/>
of nature’s laws. All commit suicide, and cut<br/>
<br/>
off many years of their natural life, who do not<br/>
<br/>
observe the means for preventing disease and of<br/>
<br/>
preserving health</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/sim_phrenological-journal-and-science-of-health_1859-03_29_3$15/pct:62.048894,12.567536,25.291036,77.307963/,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />

Twelve Ways of Committing Sui­<br/>
&quot; cide.<br/>
A medical cotemporary thus enumerates<br/>
the fashionable modes of doing it j<br/>
1. Wearing of thin shoes and cotton<br/>
stockings on damp nights, and in cool,<br/>
rainy weather. Wearing insufficient<br/>
clothing, especially on the limbs and ex­<br/>
tremities.&#x27; 2. , Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid<br/>
laziness and keeping the mind in an un­<br/>
natural state of excitement by reading<br/>
trashy novels. Going to theatres, parties<br/>
and balls in all sorts of weather in the<br/>
thinnest possible dress. Dancing till in<br/>
complete perspiration, and then going<br/>
home without sufficient over-garments,<br/>
through the cool, damp night air.<br/>
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven by<br/>
nine bedrooms without ventilation at the<br/>
top of the windows, and especially with<br/>
two or more persons in the same small,<br/>
unventilated bed room.<br/>
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimu­<br/>
lating dinners. Eating in a hurry with­<br/>
out half masticating your food, and eating<br/>
heartily before going to bed when the<br/>
mind and body are exhausted by the toils<br/>
of the day and the excitement of the eve­<br/>
ning.5. Beginning in childhood on tea and<br/>
coffee, and going from one step to another<br/>
through chewing and smoking tobacco, and<br/>
drinking intoxicating liquors j by personal<br/>
abuse, and physical and mental excesses<br/>
of other descriptions.<br/>
6. &quot; Marrying in haste and getting an<br/>
uncongenial companion, and living the re­<br/>
mainder of life in mental dissatisfaction ;<br/>
cultivating jealousies and domestic broils<br/>
and getting always in a mental torment.<br/>
7. Keeping children quiet bj giving<br/>
paregorio and cordials, and teaching them<br/>
to suck candy, and supplying tbem with<br/>
nuts and rich cake ; when they are sick<br/>
by giving them mercury, tartar emetic,<br/>
<br/>
and arsenic, under the mistaken notion<br/>
that they are medicines and not irritant<br/>
poisons.<br/>
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb<br/>
our minds, so as to leave no time to attend<br/>
to our health t . following an unhealthy oc­<br/>
cupation because money can be made by it.<br/>
&#x27; 9. Tempting the appetite with bitters<br/>
and niceties when the stomach says No,<br/>
and by forcing food to it when nature does<br/>
not demand, and even rejects it ; gorman­<br/>
dizing between meals.<br/>
10. Contriving to keep in a continual<br/>
worry about something or nothing ; giving<br/>
way to fits of anger. t<br/>
11. Being irregular in all our habits<br/>
of eating and sleeping ; eating too much,<br/>
too many kinds of food, and that which<br/>
is too highly seasoned.<br/>
12. , Neglecting to take proper care of<br/>
ourselves, and not apply early for medical<br/>
advice when disease appears ; taking cele<br/>
brated quack medicines to the degree of<br/>
making a drug shop of the body.<br/>
The above causes produce more sick­<br/>
ness, suffering and death than all epidem­<br/>
ics, malaria, and contagion, combined with<br/>
war, pestilence and famine. Nearly all<br/>
who have attained old age have been re­<br/>
markable for equanimity of temper, cor­<br/>
rect habits of diet, drink and rest, for<br/>
temperance, cheerfulness and morailty.<br/>
Physical punishment is sure to visit &#x27;the<br/>
transgressor of nature&#x27;s laws.<br/>
All commit suicide and cut off many<br/>
years of their natural life who do not ob­<br/>
serve the means of preventing disease aud<br/>
of preserving health</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/vtu_melon_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84022549%2F0041562847A%2F1867100401%2F0398.jp2/pct:20.209274,3.430712,26.959376,92.419476/!600,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />

keeping the mind in an unnatural state of excitement,<br/>
