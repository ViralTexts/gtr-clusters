Wouldn’t Marry a Mechanic.—<br/>
The following anecdote we clip from an<br/>
exchange; our fair readers will please pe­<br/>
ruse attentively, and maybe learn a good<br/>
lesson thereby:<br/>
A young man commenced visitiusr a<br/>
young woman, and appeared to be well<br/>
pleased. One evening he called when it<br/>
was quite late, when the young lady <br/>
to inquire where he had been. ‘I had<br/>
to work to-night.’ ‘What! you work for<br/>
a living?’she inquired with astonishment.<br/>
‘ Certainly,’ replied the young man, ‘ I am<br/>
a mechanic.’ ‘ I dislike the name of me­<br/>
chanic/ and she turned up her pretty<br/>
little nose. This was the last time the<br/>
young mechanic visited the young woman.<br/>
He is now a wealthy man, and has one of<br/>
the best of women for his wife. The<br/>
young lady who disliked the name of me­<br/>
chanic, is now the wife of a miserable<br/>
fool; a regular vagrant about grog shops;<br/>
and she, soft, verdant, silly, miserable<br/>
girl, is obliged to take in washing to sup­<br/>
port herself and children.<br/>
You dislike the name of mechanic, eh ?<br/>
you whose brothers are well-dressed loaf­<br/>
ers? We pity any girl with so little<br/>
brains, who is so soft as to think less of a<br/>
young man for being a mechanic—one of<br/>
God’s noblemen—the most dignified and<br/>
honorrble personage of heaven’s creatures.<br/>
Beware, young lady, how you treat the<br/>
young men that work for a living, for you<br/>
may one day be menial to one of them<br/>
yourself.<br/>
Far, far better discard the well-fed pau­<br/>
per with all his rings, braziness and pom­<br/>
posity, and take to your affections the<br/>
callous handed, intelligent and industri­<br/>
ous mechanic. Thousands have bitterly<br/>
regretted their folly who have turned<br/>
their backs to honesty. A few years have<br/>
taught them a severe lesson. In this<br/>
country, no man or woman should be re­<br/>
spected who will not work bodily as well<br/>
