THE GOLDEN SIDE.<br/>
“ Now, the God of all hope fill you with all joy and<br/>
peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope,<br/>
through the power of the Holy Ghost.”—Rom. xv. 13.<br/>
<br/>
There is many a rest in the road of life,<br/>
If we only would stop to make it;<br/>
And many a tone from the better land,<br/>
If the querulous heart would take it.<br/>
To the sunny soul, that is full of hope,<br/>
And whose beautiful trust ne’er faileth,<br/>
The grass is green, and the flowers are bright,<br/>
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.<br/>
<br/>
Better to hope though the clouds hang low<br/>
And to keep the eyes still lifted,<br/>
<br/>
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,<br/>
When the ominous clouds are rifted !<br/>
<br/>
There was never a night without a day,<br/>
Or an evening without a morning ;<br/>
<br/>
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,<br/>
Is the hour before the dawning.<br/>
<br/>
There is many a gem in the path of life<br/>
Which we pass in our idle pleasure.<br/>
That is richer far than the jewelled crown,<br/>
Or the miser’s hoarded treasure;<br/>
It may be the love of a little child,<br/>
Or a mother’s prayers to heaven,<br/>
Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks<br/>
For a cup of water given.<br/>
<br/>
Better to weave in the web of life<br/>
A bright and golden filling,<br/>
And to do God’s will with a ready heart,<br/>
And hands that are swift and willing,<br/>
Than to snap the delicate, minute threads<br/>
Of our curious lives asunder,<br/>
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,<br/>
And sit and grieve and wonder</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/sim_friend-a-religious-and-literary-journal_1875-10-02_49_7$3/pct:39.266706,12.081784,27.498522,38.545539/,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />

THE BRIGHT SIDE.<br/>
<br/>
There is many a rest in the road of life,<br/>
If we only would stop to take it,<br/>
And many a tone from the better land,<br/>
If the querulous heart would wake it !<br/>
To the sunny soul that is full of hope,<br/>
And whose beautiful trust ne’er faileth,<br/>
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,<br/>
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.<br/>
<br/>
Better to hope, though the clouds hang low,<br/>
And to keep the eyes still lifted ;<br/>
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep thro’<br/>
When the ominous clouds are rifted !<br/>
There was never a night without a day,<br/>
Or an evening without a morning ;<br/>
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,<br/>
Is the hour before the dawning.<br/>

Or the miser’s hoarded treasure ;<br/>
<br/>
It may be the love of a little child,<br/>
Or a mother’s prayers to Heaven ;<br/>
<br/>
Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks,<br/>
For a cup of water given.<br/>
<br/>
Better to weave in the web of life<br/>
A bright and golden filling,<br/>
<br/>
And to do God’s will with a ready heart,<br/>
And hands that are s</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/sim_pennsylvania-school-journal_1899-05_47_11$36/pct:46.405920,23.346117,35.482734,42.138063/,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />
