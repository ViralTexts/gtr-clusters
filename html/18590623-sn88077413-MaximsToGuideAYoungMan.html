We do not often see more sound advice in the same space. We commend it to all young men just starting out in life. CUT IT OUT and put it in your purse:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Keep good company, or none. Never be idle. If your hands can&#x27;t be usefully employed, attend to the cultivation of your mind. Always speak the truth. Make few promises. Live up to your engagements. Keep your own secrets, if you have any. When you speak to a person, look him in the face. Good company, and good conversation, are the very sinews of virtue. Good character is above all things else. Your character cannot be essentially injured, except by your own acts. If any one speaks evil of you, let your life be so that no one will believe him. Drink no kind of intoxicating liquors. Ever live (misfortune excepted) within your income. When you retire to bed, think over what you have been doing during the day. Make no haste to be rich if you would prosper. Small and steady gains give competency, with tranquility of mind. Never play at any game of chance. Avoid temptation; though you fear you may not withstand it. Earn money before you spend it. Never run into debt unless you see a way to get out of it. Never borrow if you can possibly avoid it. Do not marry until you are able to support a wife. Never speak evil of any one. Be just before you are generous. Keep yourself innocent, if you would be happy. Save when you are young, that you may spend when you are old. Read over the above maxims at least once a week.&#x27;<br/>
