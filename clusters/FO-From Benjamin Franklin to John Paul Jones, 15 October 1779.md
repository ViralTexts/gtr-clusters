Dear Sir,Passy Oct. 15. 1779.  
I received the Account of your Cruize &amp; Engagement with the Serapis, which you did me the honour to send me from the Texel. I have since received your Favour of the 8th from Amsterdam. For some Days after the Arrival of your Express scarce any thing was talked of at Paris and Versailles but your cool Conduct and persevering Bravery during that terrible Conflict. You may believe that the Impression on my Mind was not less strong than that on others, but I do not chuse to say in a Letter to yourself all I think on such an Occasion.  
The Ministry are much dissatisfied with Captain Landais, and M. De Sartine

I am uneasy about your Prisoners. I wish they were safe in France. You will then have compleated the glorious Work of giving Liberty to all the Americans that have so long languished for it in the British Prisons: for there are not so many there as you have now taken.  
I have the Pleasure to inform you that the two Prizes sent to Norway are safely arrived at Berghen.  
With the highest Esteem, I am Dear Sir, Your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant

I am sorry for your Misundersta
