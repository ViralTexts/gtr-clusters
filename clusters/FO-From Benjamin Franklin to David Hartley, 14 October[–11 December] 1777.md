f America. As to our submitting again to the Government of Britain, ‘tis vain to think of it. She has given us by her numberless Barbarities, in the Prosecution of the War, and in the Treatment of Prisoners, (by her Malice in bribing Slaves, to murder their Masters, and Savages to Massacre the Families of Farmers, with her Baseness in rewarding the unfaithfulness of Servants, and debauching the Virtue of honest Seamen, entrusted with our Property,) so deep an Impression of her Depravity, that we never again can trust her in the Management of our Affairs, and Interests.

 this means, with Regard to the Prisoners now in your Goals. They complain of very severe Treatment. They are far from their Friends and Families, and a Winter is coming on, in which they must suffer extreamly, if continued in their present Situation, fed scantily on bad Provisions, without warm Lodging, Clothes or Fire; and not suffer’d to write to or receive Visits from their Friends, or even from the humane and charitable of their Enemies.

If you could have Leisure to visit the Goals in which they are confined, and should be desirous of knowing the Truth relative to the Treatment they receive, I wish you would take the Trouble of distributing among the most necessitous according to their Wants five or six hundred Pounds, for which your Drafts on me here should be punctually honour’d: You could then be able to speak with more certainty to the Point in Parliament, and that might be attended with good Effect.  
If you cannot obtain for us Permission to send a Commissary, possibly you may find a trusty humane discrete Person at Plymouth, and another at Portsmouth, who would undertake to distribute what Relief we may be able to afford, those unhappy brave Men, Martyrs to the Cause of Liberty. Your King will not reward you for taking this Trouble, but God will. I shall not mention the Gratitude of America: You will have what is better, the Applause of your own Good Conscience. Our Captains have set at Liberty above 200 of your People made Prisoners by our armed Vessels and brought into France; besides a greater

complain of very severe treatment, far from their friends and families, and winter coming  
on in which they must suffer extremely, &amp;c.; fed scantily on bad provisions, without warm  
lodging, clothes, or fire; not suffered to invite or receive visits from their friends, or even

gaols in which they are confined, and should be desirous of knowing the truth relative to  
the treatment they receive, I wish you would take the trouble of distributing among the  
most necessitous according to their wants, five or six hundred pounds, for which your  
drafts on me here shall be punctually honored. You could then be able to speak with some  
certainty to the point in Parliament, and this might be attended with good effects. If you  
cannot obtain permission for us to send a commissary, possibly you may find a trusty, hu-  
mane, discreet person at Plymouth, and another at Portsmouth, who would undertake to  
communicate what relief we may be able to afford those unfortunate men, martyrs to the  
cause of liberty. Your King will not reward you for taking this trouble, but God will. I  
shall not mention the gratitude of America; you will have what is better, the applause of  
your own good conscience. Our —— have set at liberty above two hundred of your  
people, made prisoners by our armed vessels, and brought into France,” &amp;c. Franklin again
