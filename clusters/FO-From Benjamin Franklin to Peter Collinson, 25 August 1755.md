ear Sir,  
Philadelphia, Aug. 25, 1755.  
As you have my former papers on Whirlwinds, &amp;c. I now send you an account of one which I had lately an opportunity of seeing and examining myself.  
Being in Maryland, riding with Col. Tasker, and some other gentlemen to his country-seat, where I and my son were entertained by that amiable and worthy man, with great hospitality and kindness, we saw in the vale below us, a small whirlwind beginning in the road, and shewing itself by the dust it raised and contained. It appeared in the form of a sugar-loaf, spinning on its point, moving up the hill towards us, and enlarging as it came forward. When it passed by us, its smaller part near the ground, appeared not bigger than a common barrel, but widening upwards, it seemed, at 40 or 50 feet high, to be 20 or 30 feet in diameter. The rest of the company stood looking after it, but my curiosity being stronger, I followed it, riding close by its side, and observed its licking up, in its progress, all the dust that was under its smaller part. As it is a common opinion that a shot, fired through a waterspout, will break it, I tried to break this little whirlwind, by striking my whip frequently through it, but without any effect. Soon after, it quitted the road and took into the woods, growing every moment larger and stronger, raising, instead of dust, the old dry leaves with which the ground was thick covered, and making a great noise with them and the branches of the trees, bending some tall trees round in a circle swiftly and very surprizingly, though the progressive motion of the whirl was not so swift but that a man on foot might have kept pace with it, but the circular motion was amazingly rapid. By the leaves it was now filled with, I could plainly perceive that the current of air they were driven by, moved upwards in a spiral line; and when I saw the trunks and bodies of large trees invelop’d in the passing whirl, which continued intire after it had left them, I no longer wondered that my whip had no effect on it in its smaller state. I accompanied it about three quarters of a mile, till some limbs of dead trees, broken off by the whirl, flying about, and falling near me, made me more apprehensive of danger; and then I stopped, looking at the top of it as it went on, which was visible, by means of the leaves contained in it, for a very great height above the trees. Many of the leaves, as they got loose from the upper and widest part, were scattered in the wind; but so great was their height in the air, that they appeared no bigger than flies. My son, who was, by this time, come up with me, followed the whirlwind till it left the woods, and crossed an old tobacco-field, where, finding neither dust nor leaves to take up, it gradually became invisible below as it went away over that field. The course of the general wind then blowing was along with us as we travelled, and the progressive motion of the whirlwind was in a direction nearly opposite, though it did not keep a strait line, nor was its progressive motion uniform, it making little sallies on either hand as it went, proceeding sometimes faster, and sometimes slower, and seeming sometimes for a few seconds almost stationary, then starting forwards pretty fast again. When we rejoined the company, they were admiring the vast height of the leaves, now brought by the common wind, over our heads. These leaves accompanied us as we travelled, some falling now and then round about us, and some not reaching the ground till we had gone near three miles from the place where we first saw the whirlwind begin. Upon my asking Col. Tasker if such whirlwinds were common in Maryland, he answered pleasantly, No, not at all common; but we got this on purpose to treat Mr. Franklin. And a very high treat it was, to Dear Sir, Your affectionate friend, and humble servant  
B. F.

my fon were entertained by thgga-  
miable and worthy man wirh fe  
hofpitality and kindnefs, we {7

beginning in the road, and thewing  
atfelf by the duft it raifed and cone  
tained. It appeared in the form of  
a fugar-loaf, {pinning on its point,  
moving up-the hill towards us, and

it pafied by us, its fmaller part, near

The reft of the company ftood look-

fo {wift but that a man on foot might  
have kept pace with it, but thecir-  
cular motios was amazingly rapid.  
By the Jeaves it was now filled with,  
I could plainly perceive that the  
current of air they were driven by,  
moved apwards im a {piral line; and  
when J faw the paffiag whirl continue  
entire, after leaving the tranks and  
bodies of large trees which it had en-  
veloped, | no longer wondered that  
my whip had no effect on it in its  
{maller ftate. i accompanied it about  
three quarters of a mile, till fome  
lim s of dead trees, broken off by the  
whirl, flying about, and falling near  
me, made me more appreheniive of  
danger; and then I ftopped, looking  
at the top of it as it went on, which  
was vifible, by means of the leaves  
contained in it, for a very great  
height above the trees. Many of  
the leaves, as they got loofe from the  
upper and wideft part, were feattered  
in the wind; but fo great was their  
height in the air, that they appeared  
no bigger than flies. My fon, who  
was,by this time, come up with me,  
followed the whirlwind till it left the  
woods, and croffed an old tobacco-  
field, where, finding neither duit nor  
leaves totakeup, it gradually became  
invifible below, as 1t went away over  
that field. The courfe of the gene-  
ral wind, then blowing, was along  
with us as we travelled, and the pro-  
reflive motion of the whirlwind was  
in a direétion nearly oppofite, tho’ it  
did not keep a ftraitline, nor was  
its proggeflive motion uniform, it  
making little failies on either hand as  
it went, proceeding fometimes fafter,  
and fometimes flower, and feeming  
fometimes, for a tew feconds, almojt  
ftacionary, then fiarting forwards,  
pretty faftagain. When we rejoined  
the company,they were admiring the  
valt heightof the leaves,now brought  
by the common wind over our heads.  
&quot;‘Thefe leaves accompanied us as we  
travelled, fome falling now and then  
  
tound about us, and fome not reach-  
  
  
  
ing the ground till we had gone neat  
three miles from the place where we  
firft faw the whirlwind begin. Upon  
my afking col. Tatker if fuch whirl-  
winds were common in Maryland,  
he anfwered pleafantly, No, not at  
all common; bat we got this on pur-  
pofe to treat mr. Franklin. Anda
