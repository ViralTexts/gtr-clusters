s Defence of Mr. Hemphill’s Observations. Before it appeared, however, not only was Hemphill’s case losing in interest, but his cause was irretrievably lost. During the summer, one of the clerical party discovered that Hemphill’s sermons were not his own, but those of notorious Arians. Putting on the best face he could, Franklin stoutly affirmed he would rather hear Hemphill deliver “good sermons composed by others than bad ones of his own Manufacture”; but the “detection gave many of our party disgust” and cost Hemphill many supporters. Refusing to defend himself before the Synod, declaring that the pamphlet then in the press contained his defense, he defiantly challenged them to excommunicate him. The Synod ignored the challenge, but, September 22, unanimously made his suspension permanent and his destruction complete.  
Hemphill left Philadelphia, and no more is known of him. As for Franklin, he “quitted the congregation, never joining it after,” though he continued to give its ministers financial support for many years.

 in the Place. But the Zeal of having a hand in the Condemnation of a Heretick carried them beyond all other Considerations. The Synod upon the whole unanimously voted them proper Judges; which Unanimity, in the Extract of their Minutes, they ascribe to God as the Work of divine Providence. To make God the Author of a palpable Piece of Injustice, is little better than Blasphemy, and I charge it on ’em as such. And their saying, in the case of Thompson, that there was no Evidence; I charge upon ’em, as a downright Falsehood. Of these two Burthens, I leave them to disengage their Shoulders as well as they can. But

 I ask’d him, if he thought he shou’d be willing, when the Commission met, to shew them his Notes, if requir’d; and he answer’d, Yes. The Clerk minuted it thus, I ask’d him, if when the Commission met, he wou’d shew them his Notes, if requir’d; and he answer’d, he wou’d.  
Thus by a Hocus Pocus slight of hand in the management of this Evidence, they converted an Opinion of Hemphill’s of what he might be willing to do some Months afterwards, into an absolute Promise of what he really wou’d do. And thus alter’d and wrapt up, the Rev. Witnesses took their solemn Affirmation to the Truth of what the Clerk had written.

And he elsewhere tells us, that Christ dyed for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him, (i.e. in Obedience to his Laws) which died for them, and rose again. And St. Peter expresly tells us the same thing, when he says, that Jesus Christ bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, that we being dead unto Sin should live unto Righteousness. Our Saviour himself, as was before observ’d, tells us, that he came to call Sinners to Repentance. But what need I trouble the Reader with quoting any more Passages to this Purpose?

since ’tis plainly applicable to none but themselves, and can by no means touch Hemphill; for, he contended for the Power of Godliness, denying the Form; and ’tis well known, that none but the Men of Sense were on his Side, and that all the silly Women of the Congregation were inveterately bent against him, being zealous Abettors of Mr. Andrews, who crept into their Houses, and led them away captive to the Commission
