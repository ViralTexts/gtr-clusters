To the Earl of Buckinghamshire.  
My Lord,  
When I mentioned a few of the Consequences that might arise from blocking up the Harbours in North America, and promised to make some Remarks upon other Schemes that had been projected for humbling the Colonists, I did not intend to trouble your Lordship or the Public by stooping to remark upon that Ferrago of Reproaches, which are daily thrown out against the miserable inhabitants of that Country, by People who appear to be no better acquainted with their History or Constitution than they are with the Inhabitants of the Moon; my Intention was to take Notice of such Schemes as were frequently mentioned in public, and such as it seemed probable the Minister might adopt, because they were of the same Species with some that have already been adopted. But we are no longer to form Conjectures about what Manner in which Great Britain is to punish the Americans; we now see the Course in which she is to proceed, though we are not certain how long she may continue in that Course. The Port of Boston is to be shut up; its Trade is to be utterly destroyed; the Inhabitants, about twenty-five thousand in Number, are devoted to Poverty, Hunger and Death. We have been told by Governor Hutchinson, that the Men of Property, and a great Majority of the better Sort of People, are steady Friends to Government; the late Riots were certainly committed by a small Mob. Now it is discovered that the most equitable and merciful Way of obtaining Redress for the Outrages committed by a wrong-headed Mob, is by destroying Trade, punishing Men of Fortune, and bringing Thousands of innocent Families to Ruin. Doubtless there were other Methods of obtaining Redress. In former Cases, when a House has been pulled down, or a Citizen’s Goods destroyed by a Riot, the Provincial Assemblies have been applied to, and have paid the Damages: The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay would doubtless have paid for the Tea, had it been required of them in the usual Form. It is well known, that the Father of this City, and several other Gentlemen, were willing to give Security for the Payment of the Tea on those Terms. But that would have been a trifling Scheme, by which we could hardly expect the Pleasure of making a single Woman or Child shed a Tear; whereas the present Plan perfectly agrees with our Ideas of governing a distant Colony; it affords the pleasing Prospect of starving at least a Thousand of them to Death, and reducing Half of the Remainder to Beggary; to say nothing of the Motion that it must give to the Wheels of Trade on this Side of the Water. By this Plan also we are certain of securing the Affections of the Colonists: After this signal Proof of Lenity and Kindness, they will never forget us: If we should ever need their Assistance in the Time of Danger, they will certainly embrace the first Opportunity of shewing their Gratitude, and returning our Favours in kind. Such are the Observations, that are often made in Favour of the Measures that are now adopted for punishing the Colonies. For my Part, I may be singular in my Opinion, but though I cannot commend the Measure, I shall, on all Occasions, endeavour to speak of it with that Veneration which is due to a Scheme sanctified by the Voice of a British Parliament. In the mean while I may be indulged in offering a few Conjectures concerning the probable Operation of that Act by which the Port of Boston is to be destroyed. Certainly the Design of the Act is not to shut up the Port of Boston till the People have paid for the Tea that was destroyed, because Restitution might be obtained by gentler Means; and the Minister would never offer such an Insult to Humanity as to starve, ruin or distress above Twenty Thousand People in order to collect £11,000 nor could he value himself upon taking that by Force which the People would have given willingly. Neither is the Design of the Act to shut up the Port till the People have made Submission for the late Riot, and promised not to do the like again; for it is not to be supposed that the Rioters are known, else they may be punished in due course of Law; and the Public cannot possibly make Submission for an Action that was not done by the Public, though they may pay the Damages; nor can they promise, without being guilty of the greatest Absurdity, that no future Riots shall be committed, because Riots may happen, and frequently do happen, under the most orderly and perfect Police. The Design then of the Act must be, and this appears to be the Design on the very Face of it, “To shut up the Port of Boston until the People have engaged or promised to pay all Customs and Duties whatever that are imposed by a British Parliament.” Now, as I take it, the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston can give no Security for the future Payment of such Duties, because they may not be able to perform, though they should promise; and what is done by the Select Men, or even what is done by a Town Meeting, will be a weak Bond wherewith to bind the Populace. The Inhabitants of the neighbouring Towns are as active in all those Riots, perhaps more active than the Inhabitants of Boston. The Minister knows very well that the Town of Boston alone can give no Promises which shall be Security. Nor is it intended that the Submission or Promise of that Town should be considered as satisfactory. A Submission and Promise is expected from the other Towns as well as Boston; in plain Terms, it is expected that the Commons House of Assembly should acknowledge “the Right of the British Parliament to impose Taxes on the Inhabitants of that Province.” Now, my Lord, if the Port of Boston is to remain shut till the People in that Province acknowledge the Right of Parliament to impose any Taxes or Duties whatever, except for the Regulation of Commerce, it must remain shut till the very Name of a British Parliament is forgotten among them. You may shut up their Ports, one by one, as the Minister has lately threatened. You may reduce their Cities to Ashes; but the Flame of Liberty in North America shall not be extinguished. Cruelty and Oppression and Revenge shall only serve as Oil to increase the Fire. A great Country of hardy Peasants is not to be subdued. In the Grave which we dig for the Inhabitants of Boston, Confidence and Friendship shall expire, Commerce and Peace shall rest together. I have the Honour to be, &amp;c.  
Fabius.

To th&quot; Earlo/BUCh.INGH AMSFIIRE.  
Mr Lo*i&gt;,  
WHEN I mentioned a few of th* eonjefuences  
that might arift font beating up the hart purs m  
North-America, and prowled to matt feme remarks upon  
other jehemes that had been p rcjefhd for humbling the coh­  
„,JJ,, 7 did m t intend to trsuite your .ordjhip or the public by  
ftco-ivn to remark upon that far ago of rapiiades, which art  
daily thrown out agair.ft the mijerable inhabitants of that  
aunty, f&#x27;v people who appear 11 be no better acquainted with  
their biftory ot conftstutivn than they are with the inhabitants  
of the moon ; my intention was to take notice of fu, h jehemes  
as w re frequently mentioned in public, and ju.h as st jermed  
probable tie min.fter might adopt, because they were of the  
lame fpecits with fomc that have already been ad. pied. Hut  
&lt;we fe no longer to form cor.jeiiurcs about what manner in  
which Great Britain is to pumjh the Americans ; we now  
fee the ecurfe in which jhe is to proceed, though we are not  
certain how long jhe may ccntinur in that cour/e. The port  
of Boston is to be jhut up ; its uadc it to be utterly dtftroycd;  
Ihe inhabitants, about twenty-five thousand in number, are  
devoted to tioverty, henger and death. IV? have been told  
by governor Huttbmfoa, that the men of property, and a great  
majority of the better fort of people, O&#x27;C JlejJy friends to go­  
vernment ; the late ion were certainly committed by a small  
mob. Now it is dis overed that the most equitable and mer­  
nf’tl way of obtaining red ref so- the outrages committed by  
0 amor, -beaded mob, is by aeftrtyimg trade, pur.ijhwg men of  
fortune, and bringing thoufandi of inneuent families to rum.  
Doublltfs there avert other methods of obtaining redress. In  
Cornier file&#x27;, when a house has been pulled down,;- a citizen&#x27;s  
gpods d fryed by a riot, tot provincial ajfembhet havt bten  
applied to. and have paid the damages : The ajjtmbly of  
Majfachujetts-Bay would dcubtlefs have paid for the tea,had  
it been required cf them in the usual form. It ii well known,  
that the father of this city, and feveral other gent emen,  
were willing to give security for tee payment of the tea on  
tboj&#x27;r terms. But that would have hem a trifling scheme,  
by which we could hardy expert the pieafure of making a  
i.rglt woman or ihtld jhal a tear ; whereas the present plan  
’’prrftrtly agrees with cur ideas cf governing a distant Colony ;  
\t a fords the plcafng proff-ert offt a ruing at leaf! a thousand  
A&quot;mem to d atb, amt redu mg half or the remainder to begg­  
rry y to fay nothing of the motion that it must gn eto the  
wheels ot t-adecn this fide es the water. By this plan also  
we are terrain effecurmg the affections of the eolonijts : Af­  
ter this fifnuip’uef of lenity and kmdnefs, they will never  
forget us : 1/ we should ever need their afpftance in the time  
of danger, they m id certainly embrace tb, firft opportunity of  
bewirg thei&gt; gratitude, and returning our favours m mud.  
Su h are the enervations, that are o ften made in favour of  
the measures that are now adopted for punijhing the lelcnier.  
For my part, I may be fingstlar in my opinion, but though I  
cannot commend fi r measures, I jhall, on all eccafions, tndea­  
-,-ur to /peak of it with that veneration which is due to a  
J heme \anrtijied by the voi,e of a Bnrifh parliament. In  
,ne mean Wtu&#x27;e l may be indulged tn ofering a few conjert­  
ures concerning the probable Operation of that art hy which  
tkt port of Boston is to be defrayed. Crrtainij the design of  
the Art u not to Jhut up the port of 80/lon till the people hoc e  
p A fir Ihr tro that nvrts deflrtytJ, because rfftirutun might  
be obtained by gen’ler means ; and the mimjlcr wou d never  
oder iuclj an it;full to humanity as tcftarvi., ruin or dijlrefs  
.~e twenty ihjufard people .it or tie* to toßirt 11 ,f&#x27;&lt;SOi. nor  
■ d he value l bit (elf open taking that by force which the  
•cede wmld tame given willingly• NcitcJr is tie defion  
‘ • the ert to jhut up the port till tit people have madefubm.jftm  
th b-f re&#x27;, *n4 prerr fxt r.x to us the /for tyga r : foe t.  
  
• !\ L.ft ;ifc be-vn, J&#x27;e retry my f,  
y enijfj dlts due tmurfe if A: ft; ; and the pw Hi cannot p jft&#x27;y  
metle fnbmijft r. for an aAhn flat teas um dine by rb; palii&lt;,  
thoug1 they may f ,ty the damagt, nor can rbty promife,-with­  
out &lt;eing fuii-y of the great .ft ai furdiy, that no future riots  
fholl »e committed, because riots may bap pen, tnd frequent fy  
do happen, under the most orderly and perfeft M see. The  
deftgn then of:be a T must be, and this appears to be the i­  
fign on the very Face of it “ To jbue up the pot t of Biflan  
“ until the pc iple have engaged or pr-mifed to pry all ■hftinrs  
“ and duties whatevr that are impeded by a fit i&#x27;ifh parlia­  
“ trt&#x27;nt.’’ Nona, as I take it, the inhabitants of&#x27;the tcron of  
B fieri can gk&#x27;t no security for the future payment ofju.b  
duties, because they may net be able to perform, though they  
fbould promiife ; and whji is done by the Jtlert-men, or men  
what is done by a rmtvn-meeting, null be a eve-k bond where­  
with to hind the populate. The inhabitants of the neighbour­  
ing tenors are as artk’e in all tbfe riots, perhaps more arthif  
than the inhabitants of BoJlon. The Msnifter krnos very  
well that the tenon of Boston alone can give no premijm  
which Jhal! be security. Nor is it intended that the fubmij­  
ftett or promije of that tenon jbsutdbe conftdered as fatisfa.Tory.  
A submission at.d promt ft is expelled from the other towns as  
nvell as Boston ; in plain ’erms it is expected that the commons  
house of affemldy should a. knowledge “ the • ight of the Britijh  
“ parliament to impost taxes on the inhabitants of that pro­  
“ n incc.&quot; Nona, my lord, if the port es Boston is to remain  
Jhut till the people in that province acknonvhdgr the right of  
parliament to impose any taxes or duties wb.it&#x27;vtr, except for  
the regulation of commerce, it must remain jhut till the very  
name of a Briti/b parliament is forgotten among them. You  
may jhut up them ports, one by one, as the mimjlcr has lately  
threatened. You may reduce their titles to ajhes but the  
fame of liberty in Nottb-Amtrita /hall not be exthtguijhni.  
Cruelty and rppr jften and revenge /ball only frrntea* eilic in­  
creafetbe Fire. A great country of hardy peafan&#x27;t is not to  
be (übdued. In the grave which we dig for the inhabitants  
of Boston, confidence andfriendfhip Jhal! expire, crtmmene  
andpeace/hall rest together.
