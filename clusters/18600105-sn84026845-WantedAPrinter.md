**Wanted—a Printer.**  
  
&quot;Wanted—a printer,&quot; says a contemporary. Wanted—a mechanical curiosity, with brain and fingers; a thing that will set so many ems a day; a machine that will think and act, but still a machine; a being who undertakes the most systematic and monotonous drudgery—yet one the ingenuity of man has never supplanted, mechanically; that&#x27;s a printer.   
  
A printer: yet, for all his dissipated and reckless habits, a worker—at all times and hours, by day and by night; setting up in close and unwholesome offices, when gay crowds are hurrying to theatres; later still, when street revellers (sic) are gone and the city sleeps; in the fresh air of the morning, in the broad and gushing sunlight, some printing machine is at its case, with its eternal, unvarying click! click!  
  
Click! click! the polished cubes fall into he stick; the mute integers of expression are marshaled into line, and march forth as immortal print. Click! and the latest intelligence becomes old, the thought a principle, the simple idea a living sentiment. Click! click! from grave to gay, item after item—a robbery, a murder, a bit of scandal, a graceful and glowing thought, are in turn clothed by the mute and impassive fingers of the machine, and set adrift in the sea of thought. He must not think of the future nor recall the past; he must not think of home, of kindred, of wife, or of babe. His work lies before him, and thought is chained to his copy.   
  
You know him by his works, who read the papers, and are quick at typographical errors; whose eye may rest on this mute evidence of ceaseless toil; correspondents, editors, and authors, who scorn the simple medium of your fame, think not that the printer is altogether a machine. Think not that he is indifferent to the gem of which he is but the setter. Think not a subtle ray may not penetrate the recesses of his heart, or the flowers he gathers may not leave some of their fragrance on his toil-worn fingers. But when you seek friend, companion, adviser—when you would elevate one who, from sympathy, may fitly represent either or both—when you want judges, governors, and presidents, O, ye people, advertise: &quot;Wanted—a printer.&quot;

th : gav crowds are hurrying to places

A SECRET WORTH KNOWING.  
  
An able writer gives utterance to the following valua-  
ble secret:  
  
This looking forward to enjoyment don’t pay. From  
what I know. of it I would as soon chase butterflies for  
a living, or bottle up moonshine for cloudy nights.  
The only true way to be happy, is to take the drops of  
happiness as God gives them to us every day of our  
lives. The boy must learn to be happy while he is  
learning his trade; the merchant while making his for-  
tune. If he fails to learn this art, he will be sure to  
miss his enjoyment when he gains what he has sighed

useful and industrious citizen. The idea that  
manual labor is not “respectable,” is one of  
the absurdest things in this age of absurdities.  
No person with a thimblefull of brains will  
say anything of the kind, and those silly­  
creatures who do say so are generally the de­

Every boy, whether rich or poor, high or

in forming his character.  
  
Wanted—A Printer.  
“ Wanted—a printer,” says a cotempora­

brain and fingers—a thing that will set so  
many type a day—a machine that will think  
and act, but still a machine—a being who  
undertakes the most systematic and monoto­  
nous drudgery, yet one the ingenuity of man  
has never supplanted mechanically—that’s a  
printer.  
A printer—yet for all his sometimes dissi­  
pated and reckless habits--a worker, at all  
times and hours, day and night, sitting up  
in a close and unwholesome office, when gay  
crowds are hurrying to the theatres—later  
still, when the street revelers are gone and  
the city sleeps—in the fresh air of morning—  
in the broad and gushing sunlight—some  
printing machine is at his case with its eter­  
nal unwavering click! click!  
Click ! click ! the polished types fall into  
the stick; the mute integers of expression  
are marshalled into line, and march forth as  
immortal print. Click! and the latest intel­  
ligence becomes old—the thought a sentiment

bery, a murder, a bit of scandal, a disgrace­  
ful and glowing thought—are in turn closed  
by the mute and impressive fingers of the  
machine, and set adrift in the sea of thought.  
He must not think of the future, nor recall  
the past—must not think of home, of kin­  
dred, of wife or babe—his work lies before  
him, and thought is chained to his copy.  
You know him by his works who read the  
papers and are quick at typographical errors,  
whoso eye may rest on these mute evidences  
of ceaseless toil; correspondents, editors and  
authors, who scorn the simple medium of

of his brain, or the flowers he gathers may  
leave some of their fragrance upon his toil­  
worn fingers. But when you seek a friend,

VVauted—A Printer  
  
&quot; Wanted—a Printer,&quot; eavs a cotempo­  
rary. Wanted—a mechanical curiosity,  
with a brain and fingers—a thing that will  
set so many types a day—a machine that  
will think and act, but still a machine—a  
being who understands the most systemat­  
ic and monotonous drudgery, vet one the  
ingenuity of man has never supplanted  
mechanically—that&#x27;s a Printer. „ \
A Printer—yet for all his sometimaa­  
dissipated and reckless habits—a worker,  
at all limes and hours, day and night: sit­  
ting up in a close and unwholesome office,  
when gay crowds are hurrying to the thea­  
tres—later still, when tbo street revelers  
are gone, and the city sleeps—in the fresh  
air of morning—in the broad and gushing  
sunlight—some -&#x27;printing machine&quot; is at  
his case with his eternal, unvarying click 1  
click!  
  
Click ! click ! the polished tvpes fall in­  
to the stick—the mute integers of expres­  
sion are marshaled into line, and march  
fwith as ipniortaut print. Click ! and the  
latest intelligence becomes old—the tho&#x27;t  
a principle—the idea a living sentiment.  
Click ! click ! from the grave to gay, item  
after item—a robbery, a murder, a bit of  
scandal, a grac ful and glowing thought­  
are in turn closed by the mute and im­  
pressive fingers of the machine and set  
ad:ift in the sea of thought. He must not  
think of the future, nor recall the past—  
must not think of home, of kindred, of wife  
or of babe—his work lies before him, and  
thought is chained to his copy.  
Yon know him by his walks, who read  
the papers and are quick at typographical  
errors—whose eye may rest on these muta  
evidences of Ceaseless toil; coarespond­  
ents, editors and authois, who scorn the  
i-iinple medium of \ our fame, think not  
that the Printer is altogether a machine—  
think not he is indifferent to the gem of  
which lie is hut the setter; the subtle ray  
may penetrate the recesses of his brain ; of  
the flowers he g ithers, some may leave  
their fragrance npon his toil-work fingers.  
l&gt;ut when you seek a friend, companion,  
adviser, when you would elevate one who  
for sympathy may represent either or both,  
when you want Judges,. Legislators, Gov­  
ernors and Presidents—O, ye people, ad­

years of your life and happiness are mort­  
gaged by this habit of worrying? And  
after all, what does it accomplish? How  
does it help you on? How much strength  
does it bring to you in your labors and ex­  
ertions? None--none whatever. A ruf­  
fled temper all the time throws to the sur­  
face the &quot;mire and dirt&quot; of the nature; it  
does not combine the hest elements, and  
help them to work together to the best ad­  
vantage but only the worst and gives them  
alone all the chance. A beautiful sunny  
temper is no sign of weakness, as many  
suppose, but of strength and harmony of  
character. It shows that there is a power  
seated at the centre of the being, that  
knows how to administer the Government.  
Lord Clarendon wrote of anger, that is  
is the most impotent passion that occupies  
the mind of man; it effects nothing it goes  
about, and hurts the man who is possessed  
by it more than any other against whom it  
is directed. He knew the human heart.  
The worst of anger is, if you give the  
reins to it for once, it is still more difficult  
for you to keep them yourself the next  
time, and makes over the next time, and  
makes over just so much of it to the ene­  
my. But a cheerful temper is like the  
genial sun, in whose warm rays all men  
like to bask. The possessor of such may  
not, perhaps, make as many stare and  
tremble at his barbed phrases of sattire  
and scorn, but he will certainly make  
more devoted and loving friends, and what  
is more, be very sure to keep them.

A Sunny Teneer.- You gain nothing by fret.  
ting; you only waste your strength by it. Choose  
your work, plan as skillfully as you can, put  
your whole heart into what you are about to do,  
and leave the rest to a kind providence that  
overlooks not a single one of us. Do you know  
how many years of your life and happiness are  
mortgaged by this habit of worrying? And after  
all what does it accomplish? How does it help  
you on? How much strength does it bring to  
you in your labors and exertion? None--none  
whatever. A ruffled temper all the time throws  
to the surface the &quot;mire and dirt&quot; of the nature;  
it does not combine the best elements and help  
them to work together to the best advantage,  
but only the worse, and gives them alone all the  
chance. A beautiful, sunny temper is no sign  
of weakness, as many suppose, but of strength  
and harmony of character. It shows that there  
is a power seated at the center of the being that  
knows how to administer the Government.  
Lord Clarendon wrote of anger, that it is the  
most impotent passion that occupies the mind of  
man, it effects nothing, it goes about and hurls  
the man who is possessed by it more than any  
other against whom it is directed. He knew the  
human heart. The worst of anger is, if you give  
the reins to it for once, it is still more difficult  
for you to keep them yourself the next time,  
makes over just so mach of it to the enemy.  
But a cheerful temper is like the genial sun, in  
whose warm rays all men like to bask. The pos.  
sessor of such may not, perhaps, make as many  
stare and tremble at his barbed phrases of satire  
or scorn, but he will certainly make more devo­  
ted and loving friends, and what is more, will  
be very sure to keep them.

A SuNNY TEMPER.—You gain nothing by fretting ;  
  
you only waste your strength by it. Choose your  
  
| work, plan as skillfully as you can, put your whole  
  
heart in what you are about to do, and leave the rest  
to a kind Providence that overlooks not a single one  
of us. Do you know how many years of your life  
and happiness are mortgaged by this habit of worry-  
ing? And, after all, what does it accomplish? How  
does it help you on? How much strength does it  
bring to you in your labors and exertions? None—  
none whatever. A ruffled temper all the time throws  
to the surface the “mire and dirt” of the nature ; it  
does not combine the best elements, and help them  
to work together to the best advantage, but only the  
worst, and gives them alone all the chance. &lt;A beau-  
tiful sunny temper is no sign of weakness, as many  
suppose, but of strength and harmony of character.  
It shows that there is a power seated at the center of  
the being, that shows how to administer government.  
  
Lord Clarendon wrote of anger, that it is the most  
impotent passion that occupies the mind of man ; it  
effects nothing it goes about, and hurts the man _ pos-  
sessed by it more than any other against whom it is  
He knew the heart. The worst  
of anger is, if you give the reins to it for once, it is  
  
directed. human  
still more difficult for you to keep them yourself next  
time, and makes over just so much to the enemy.  
But a cheerful temper is like the genial sun, in whose  
warm rays all men like to bask. The possessor of  
such may not, perhaps, make as many stare and  
tremble at his barbed phrases of satire or scorn, but  
he will certainly make more devoted and loving  
friends, and, what is more, be very sure to keep shent.

A Sunny Temper.  
  
You gaiii nothing by fretting; you  
only waste your strength by it. Choose  
vour work, plan as sKiiiiuuy as you  
can: put vour whole heart into what  
you are about to do; and leave the  
rest to a kind Providence that over  
looks not a single one of us. Do you  
know how many years of your life and  
happiness are mortgaged by this habit  
of worrving? And, after all, what  
does it accomplish? How does it help  
you on? How much strength docs it  
brintr to vou in vour jaoors ana exer  
tion? None, whatever. A ruffled  
temper all the time throws to the sur­  
face the &quot;mire and dirt&quot; of one&#x27;s na­  
ture: it &#x27;does not combine the best ele  
ments and help them to wprk together  
to the best advantage, but only tne  
worst and gives them alone all the  
chance. A Deautiful sunny temper is  
no sign of weakness, as many suppose,  
but of strength and harmony of char  
acter. It proves that there is a power  
settled at the centre of the being that  
knows how to administer the govern  
ments Lord Clarendon wrote oi anger,  
that it is the most important passion  
that occupies the minds of men; it  
noes about and hurts the man who is  
possessed by it more than any other  
ac-ainst whom it is directed. He knew  
the human heart The worst of anger  
is. if vou give reins to it for once, it is  
still more difficult for you to keep them  
yourself, the next time makes over just  
ro much of it to the enemy. But a  
ftheerful temner is like the genial sun  
in whose warm rays all men like to  
bask. The possessor of such may not,  
rjerhans make, as many stare and  
tremble at his barbed phrases of satire  
and scorn, but he will certainly make  
more devoted and loving friends, and  
what is more, he is very sure to keep  
them.

Wanted- A PrinTEr.  
&quot;Wanted--a printer,&quot; says a cotem  
porary. Wanted--a mechanical curi­  
osity, with brain and fingers; a thing  
that will set so many ems a day; a  
machine that will think and act, but  
still a machine; a being who under­  
stands the most systematic and mo­  
notonous drudgery,-yet one the in­  
genuity of man has never supplanted,  
mechanically; that&#x27;s a printer.  
A printer; yet, with all the dissi­  
pated and reckless habits, or worker  
at all times and hours, by day and  
night; setting up in close and un  
wholesome offices, when gay crowds  
are hurrying to theatres; later still,  
when street revelers are gone and the  
city sleeps in the morning, in the  
broad and gushing sunlight, some  
printing machine is at its case with  
its eternal unvarying click! elick!  
Click! elick! the polished cubes fall  
into the stick; the mute integers of  
expression are marshalled into line  
and march forth as immortal print.  
Click! and the latest intelligence be-  
comes old, the thought a principle,  
the simple idea a living sentiment.  
Click! click! from grave to gay, item  
after item--a robbery, a murder, a bit  
of scandal, a  
graceful and glowing  
thought, are in turn clothed by th  
mute and impassive fingers of the ma  
chine, and set adrift in the sea of  
thought. He must not think of the  
future nor recall the past; he must  
not think of home, of kindred, of wife,  
or of babe. His work lies before him,  
and thought is chained to his copy.  
You know him by his works, who  
read the papers and are quick at ty  
pographical errors; whose eye may  
not rest on this mute evidence of  
ceaseless toil; corr spondents, edi­  
tors, and authors who scorn the sim  
le medium of your frame, think not  
that the printer is altogether a ma­  
chine. Think not he is indifferent to  
the gem of which he is but the setter.  
Think not a subtle ray may not pene­  
trate the recesses of his heart or the  
flowers he gathers may not leave some  
tay  
of their fragrance on his toilworn fin  
gers. But when you seek a friend,  
companion, adviser--when you would  
elevate one, who, from sy mpathy, may  
fitly represent either or both-when  
you want juges, governors or bres­  
dents. O, ye people, advertise:  
&quot;Wanted--a printer.

worn fingers. But when you seek friend,

Wanted—A Printer.  
From tlt A ugutta (Ga. i Chronicle.  
“Wanted—A Printer,” says an adver­  
tisement. Wanted, a mechanical curios­  
ity, witn brains and Angers— a thing that  
will set so many type a day, a machine  
that will think and act, but still a ma­  
chine, a thing that will undertake the  
most systematic and monotonous drudg­  
ery, yet one that the ingenuity of man has  
never supplanted mechanically, that is a  
printer.  
A printer, yet for all his sometimes-dis­  
sipated, improvident and reckless habits,  
a worker at all times and hours, day and  
night, sitting up in a close and unwhole­  
some office when gay orowds are hurry­  
ing to the theatres; later still when the  
street revelers are gone and the city  
sleeps; in the fresh air of the morning, in  
the broad and gushing sunlight, some  
printer is at his case, with his eternal aud  
unvarying click, click!  
Click! click! the polished letters fall in­  
to the stick; the mute integers are mar­  
shaled into line and march forth as im­  
mortal print. Click! and the latest intel­  
ligence becomes old—thought a principle,  
lead a living sentiment. Click! click!  
from grave to gay—a scandal, a graceful,  
glowing sentiment are in turn closed by  
the mute and impressive lingers of the  
“machine” and set adrift in the sea of  
thought. The printer—he must not think  
of the future, nor recall the past; must  
not think of home, of kindred, of wife, nor  
of baby. His work lies before him, and  
thought is chained to his copy.  
You know him by hi 9 work as your  
eyes rest upon thoso mute evidences of bis  
ceaseless toil. Correspondents, authors,  
and publishers, who scorn the simple me­  
ilium of your lame, think not that be is  
iudifferent to the gem of which he is but  
the setter, a subtle ray may penetrate the  
recesses of the brain, or the flowers he  
gathers may leave some of the fragrance  
upon the toil-woru fingers. But when

sitting up in a dose and unwholesome j

velers are gone and the city sleeps, in  
the broad and gushing sunlight,—some  
printing machine is at his &quot;ease&quot; with  
his eternal, unvarying click! click!  
Click, click, the polished types fall into  
the stick; the mute integers of expression  
are marshalled into line, and march forth  
as immortal print. Click! and the latest  
intelligence becomes old—the thought,  
a principle; the idea, a living continent.  
Click! click! from grave to gay, item

scandal, a graceful and glowing thought,  
is in turr closed by the mute, and im­  
pressive fingers of the machine, and set  
adrift in the eea of thought. Ho must

past; must not think of home, nor kin­  
dred; of a wife or babe; his work is be­  
fore him and thought is chained to his  
&quot;copy&quot;

the papers, and are quick at typograph­  
ical errors, whose eyes may rest on these  
mute evidences of ceaseless toil. Corres­  
pondents, editors and authors, who scorn  
the simple medium of your fame, think  
not. the printer is altogether a machine;  
think not he is indifferent to the gem of

may penetrate the recessessof his brain;  
of the flowers ho gathers some may  
leave their fragrance upon his toil-worn  
fingers. But when you seek a friend,

Wanted-A PrInTER.  
New Delta.  
&quot;Wanted-A printer,&quot; says an  
advertisement. Wanted a me­  
chanical curiosity, with brain and  
fingers--a thing that will set so  
many types a day--a machine that  
will think and act, but still a ma­  
chine-a being who undertakes  
the most systematic and mone­  
tonous-drudgery, yet one that the  
ingenuity of man has never sup­  
planted mechanically--that&#x27;s a  
printer.  
A printer--yet for his some­  
times dissipated and reckless  
habits, a worker at all times and  
hour; day and night sitting up in  
a close and unwholesome office.  
when gay crowds are hurrying to  
the theaters; later still, when the  
street revelers are gone and the  
city sleeps, in the fresh air in the  
morning, in the broad and gushing  
sunlight, some printer is at his  
case, with his eternal and unvary­  
ing elick! elick!  
Click! chek! the polished types  
fall into the stick; the mute inte­  
gers are marshalled into line, and  
march forth as immortal print.  
Click! and the latest intelligence  
becomes old; thought a principle;  
simple lead a living sentiment.  
Click! Click! from grave to gay-  
a scandal, a graceful and glowing  
sentiment--are in turn closed by  
the mute and impressive fingers  
of the machine, and set adrift in  
the sea of thought. He must not  
think of the future nor recall the  
past; must not think of home, of  
kindred, of wife, nor of baby; his  
work lies before him, and though­  
is chained to his copy.  
Yon know him by his words, as  
your eyes rest upon those mute  
evidences of his ceaseless toil.  
Correspondents, authors and ad­  
visers, who scorn the simple me­  
dium of your fame, think not that  
he is indifferent to the gem of  
which he is only the setter; a sub  
tle ray may penetrate the recesses  
of his brain, or the flowers he  
gathers may leave some of their fra­  
grance upon the toil-worn fingers.  
But when you seek a friend, com  
panion, adviser-when yon want  
judges, legislators, governors and  
presidents. O, ye people advel­  
tise:  
&quot;WANTED A PrInTEr.

venue of the schools.  
The school age is the period of eight  
years, between the 6th and the 14th  
year of age, and attendance is obliga­  
tory. There are over 28,000 of these  
schools controlled by local authorities,  
with 72,000 teachers and 3,114,000  
scholars. The teachers are forbidden  
to use corporal punishment and they  
are pensioned when they have given  
so many years of service. The annual  
expense of these schools is about  
$7,000,000. There higher education is  
not yet developed, but the Imperial  
University is taking a high standard  
and may in time rank with European  
and American universities.
