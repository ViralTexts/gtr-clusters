**Wanted—a Printer.**  
  
&quot;Wanted—a printer,&quot; says a contemporary. Wanted—a mechanical curiosity, with brain and fingers; a thing that will set so many ems a day; a machine that will think and act, but still a machine; a being who undertakes the most systematic and monotonous drudgery—yet one the ingenuity of man has never supplanted, mechanically; that&#x27;s a printer.   
  
A printer: yet, for all his dissipated and reckless habits, a worker—at all times and hours, by day and by night; setting up in close and unwholesome offices, when gay crowds are hurrying to theatres; later still, when street revellers (sic) are gone and the city sleeps; in the fresh air of the morning, in the broad and gushing sunlight, some printing machine is at its case, with its eternal, unvarying click! click!  
  
Click! click! the polished cubes fall into he stick; the mute integers of expression are marshaled into line, and march forth as immortal print. Click! and the latest intelligence becomes old, the thought a principle, the simple idea a living sentiment. Click! click! from grave to gay, item after item—a robbery, a murder, a bit of scandal, a graceful and glowing thought, are in turn clothed by the mute and impassive fingers of the machine, and set adrift in the sea of thought. He must not think of the future nor recall the past; he must not think of home, of kindred, of wife, or of babe. His work lies before him, and thought is chained to his copy.   
  
You know him by his works, who read the papers, and are quick at typographical errors; whose eye may rest on this mute evidence of ceaseless toil; correspondents, editors, and authors, who scorn the simple medium of your fame, think not that the printer is altogether a machine. Think not that he is indifferent to the gem of which he is but the setter. Think not a subtle ray may not penetrate the recesses of his heart, or the flowers he gathers may not leave some of their fragrance on his toil-worn fingers. But when you seek friend, companion, adviser—when you would elevate one who, from sympathy, may fitly represent either or both—when you want judges, governors, and presidents, O, ye people, advertise: &quot;Wanted—a printer.&quot;

A printer; yet, with all the dissi­

night; setting up in close and un  
wholesome offices, when gay crowds  
are hurrying to theatres; later still,

broad and gushing sunlight, some

its eternal unvarying click! elick!  
Click! elick! the polished cubes fall

expression are marshalled into line  
and march forth as immortal print.  
Click! and the latest intelligence be-

Click! click! from grave to gay, item

You know him by his works, who

ceaseless toil; corr spondents, edi­

Think not a subtle ray may not pene­

Wantod--A Printer.  
&quot;Wanted- A Printer,&quot; says an  
advertisement. Wanted, a me­  
chanical curiosity, with brains and  
fingers--a thing that will set so  
many type a day, a machine that  
will think and act, but still a ma­  
chine, a being who undertakes the  
most systematic and monotous  
drudgery, yet one that the ingenu­  
ity of man has never supplanted  
mechanically--that&#x27;s a printer.  
A printer, yet for all his some­  
times dissipated, improvident and  
reckless habits, a worker at all  
times and hours, day and night  
sitting up in a close and unwhole­  
some office, when gay crowds are  
hurrying to the theaters; later still,  
when the street revelers are gone  
and the city sleeps in the fresh air  
of the morning, in the broad and  
gushing sunlight, some printer is  
at his case, with his eternal and  
unvarying click! click!  
Click! click! the polished letters  
fall into the stick; the mute inte.  
gers are marshaled into line and  
march forth as immortal print.  
Click! and the latest intelligence  
becomes old--thought a principle,  
simple lead a living sentiment.  
Click! click! from grave to gay--a  
scandal, a graceful, glowing senti­  
ment are in turn closed by the  
mute and impressive fingers of the  
&quot;machine&quot; and set adrift in the sea  
of thought. The printer--he must  
not think of the future, nor recall  
the past; must not think of home,  
of kindred, of wife, nor of baby.  
His work lies before him, and his  
thought is chained to his copy.  
You know him by his work as  
your eyes rest upon those mute ev­  
idences of his ceaseless toil. Cor­  
respondents, authors and publish­  
ers, who scorn the simple medium  
of your fame, think not that he is  
indifferent to the gem of which he  
is but the setter; a subtle ray may  
penetrate the recesses of the brain,  
or the flowers he gathers may leave  
some of their fragrance upon the  
toil-worn fingers. But when you  
seek a friend, a companion, adviser,  
guide--when you want judges, legis­  
lators, governors and presidents  
O, ye people, advertise: &quot;Wanted  
A Printer.&quot;
