**Wanted—a Printer.**  
  
&quot;Wanted—a printer,&quot; says a contemporary. Wanted—a mechanical curiosity, with brain and fingers; a thing that will set so many ems a day; a machine that will think and act, but still a machine; a being who undertakes the most systematic and monotonous drudgery—yet one the ingenuity of man has never supplanted, mechanically; that&#x27;s a printer.   
  
A printer: yet, for all his dissipated and reckless habits, a worker—at all times and hours, by day and by night; setting up in close and unwholesome offices, when gay crowds are hurrying to theatres; later still, when street revellers (sic) are gone and the city sleeps; in the fresh air of the morning, in the broad and gushing sunlight, some printing machine is at its case, with its eternal, unvarying click! click!  
  
Click! click! the polished cubes fall into he stick; the mute integers of expression are marshaled into line, and march forth as immortal print. Click! and the latest intelligence becomes old, the thought a principle, the simple idea a living sentiment. Click! click! from grave to gay, item after item—a robbery, a murder, a bit of scandal, a graceful and glowing thought, are in turn clothed by the mute and impassive fingers of the machine, and set adrift in the sea of thought. He must not think of the future nor recall the past; he must not think of home, of kindred, of wife, or of babe. His work lies before him, and thought is chained to his copy.   
  
You know him by his works, who read the papers, and are quick at typographical errors; whose eye may rest on this mute evidence of ceaseless toil; correspondents, editors, and authors, who scorn the simple medium of your fame, think not that the printer is altogether a machine. Think not that he is indifferent to the gem of which he is but the setter. Think not a subtle ray may not penetrate the recesses of his heart, or the flowers he gathers may not leave some of their fragrance on his toil-worn fingers. But when you seek friend, companion, adviser—when you would elevate one who, from sympathy, may fitly represent either or both—when you want judges, governors, and presidents, O, ye people, advertise: &quot;Wanted—a printer.&quot;

 of these schools is about

not yet developed, but the Imperial  
University is taking a high standard

Wanted---A Printer.  
&quot;Wanted-A Printer,&quot; says an ad­  
vertisement. Wanted a mechanical  
curiousity, with brain and fingers-a  
thing that will set so many types a  
day-a machine that will think and  
act, but still a machine-a being who  
undertakes the most systematic and  
monotonous drudgery,yet one that the  
ingenuity of man has never supplanted  
mechanically-that&#x27;s a printer.  
A printer-yet for all his some­  
times dissipated and reckless habits, a  
worker at all times and hours; day  
and night sitting up in a close and  
unwholesome office, when gay crowds  
are hurrying to the theatres; later  
still, when the street revelers are gone  
and the city sleeps, in the fresh air  
in the morning, in the broad and  
gushing sunlight; some printer is at  
his case, with his eternal and unvary­  
ing click ! click !  
Click ! Click ! the polish types fall  
into the stick; the mute integers are  
marshaled into line, and march forth  
as immortal print. Click! and the  
latest intelligence becomes odd;  
thought a principle; simple lead a  
living sentiment. Click ! Click from  
grave to gay-a scandal, a graceful and  
glowing sentiment-are in turn closed  
by the mute and impressive fingers of  
the machine, and set adrift in the sea  
of thought. He must not think of  
the future nor recall the past; must  
not think of home, of kindred,, of wife  
nor of baby ; his work lies before him,  
and his thought is chained to his copy.  
You know him by his words, as  
your eyes rest upon those mute evi­  
dences of his ceaseless toil. Corres­  
pondents, authors and advisers, who  
scorn the simple medium of your fame,  
think not that he is indifferent to the  
gem of which he is only the setter;  
a .subtle ray may pennrate the re­  
cesses of his brain, or the flowers he  
gathers may leave some of their fra­  
grance upon the toil-worn fingers.  
But when you seek a friend, compan­  
ion, adviser-when you want judges,  
legislators, governors and presidents­  
0, e people, advertise :  
&quot;Wanted-A Printer.&quot;
