**Medical Uses of Salt**  
  
In many cases of disordered stomach, a teaspoonful of salt taken three times a day is a certain cure. In the violent internal aching, termed cholic, add a tablespoonful of salt a pint of cold water, drink it and go to bed; it is one of the speediest remedies known.—The same will revive a person who seems almost dead from a heavy fall, &amp;c. In an apoplectic fit not time should be lost in pouring salt and water down the throat, if sufficient sensibility remain to allow swallowing; if not, the head must be sponged with cold water until the senses return, when salt and water will completely restore the patient from the lethargy. In the fit the feet should be placed in warm water, with mustard added, and the legs briskly rubbed, all bandages removed from the neck, &amp;c. and a cool apartment procured if possible. In many cases of severe bleeding at the lungs, when other remedies fail, Dr. Rush found two teaspoonfuls of salt completely stayed the flow of blood.—In cases of bite from a mad dog, wash the part with strong brine for an hour, then bind on some salt with a rag. In toothache, warm salt and water held to the part and renewed two or three times will relieve in most cases. If the gums be affected, wash the mouth with brine; if the teeth be covered with tartar, wash them twice a day with salt and water.—In swelled neck wash the part with brine, and drink it also, twice a day until cured.—Salt will expel worms if used in the food in moderate degree, and aids digestion, but salt meet is injurious if much used.   
  
It is reasonable to suppose that what is most plentiful on earth, is most essential to the wants of man. But we in general invert the order of nature, placing the greatest value on those things that are difficult to obtain. We burrow in the earth to obtain gold from its bosom and consider it our all in all, whereas we can neither eat nor drink it. When sickness lays its clammy hand on man, he is not apt to look to simple water as a remedy for his disease, but like the Assyrian general when told by the prophet to bathe in Jordan, and be cured of his leprosy, he scouts the simplicity of the act and the medicine, and turns away. As it was with the Philistine warrior, so it is with men at the present day, with but few to retract wisely like him, their first doubtings. Simple salt, is almost a cure for every thing with sailors,—our landsmen would rather seek medicines that come from the Persian Gulf or the wilds of Hindostan.

MEDICAL USE OF SALT.  
  
In many cases of disordered stomach, a tea-  
spoonful of salt is a certain cure. In the violent  
internal aching, termed colic, add a teaspvon-  
ful of salt to a pint of cold water ; drink it and  
g» to bed, it is one of the speediest remedies  
known. The same will revive a person who ap-  
pears almost dead from receiving a full.  
  
In an apoplectic fit, no time should he lost in  
pouring down salt and water, if sufficient sen-  
sibility remain to allow of swallowing it; if not,  
the head must he sponged with cold water until  
the sense return, when salt will completely re-  
store the patient from the lethargy.  
  
In a fit, the feet should be placed in warm  
water, with mustard added, and the legs briskly  
rubhed, all bandages removed from the neck and  
a cool apartment procured, if possible. In many  
cases of severe bleeding at the lungs, and when  
other remedies failed, Dr. Rush found that two  
teaspoonsful of salt completely stayed the bluod.  
  
In case of a bite froma mad dug, wash the  
part with a strong brine fur an hour, and then  
bind on some salt with a rag.  
  
In toothache, salt and wafm water held to the  
part, and removed two or three times, will re-  
lieve it in most cases. If the gums be affected,  
wash the mouth with brine. If the teeth be  
covered with tartar, wash them twice a day with  
salt and. water.  
  
In swelled neck, wash the part with brine,  
and drink it also twice a day, until cured.  
  
Salt will expel worms, if used in food ina  
moderate degree, and aids digestiun, but salt meat  
is injurious, if used much.

MEDICAL USE OF SALT.  
In many caces of disordered stomach  
a teaspoonful of salt is a certain cure.  
In the violent internal aching, termed  
colic, add a teaspoonful of salt to a pint  
of water, drink it and go to bed. It is  
one of the speediest remedies known.  
The same will revive a person who seems  
almost dead from receiving a heavy fall.  
In an apoplectic fit no time should be  
lost in pouring down salt and water if  
sufficient sensibility remain to admit of  
swallowing it; if not the head must be  
sponged with cold water until the senses  
return, when salt will completely restore  
the patient from his lethargy. In a fit  
the feet should be placed in warm water,  
with mustard added, and the legs briskly  
rubbed, all bandages removed from the  
neck and a cool apartment procured if  
possible. In many cases of severe  
bleeding at the lungs, and when other
