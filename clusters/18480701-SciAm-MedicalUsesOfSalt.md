**Medical Uses of Salt**  
  
In many cases of disordered stomach, a teaspoonful of salt taken three times a day is a certain cure. In the violent internal aching, termed cholic, add a tablespoonful of salt a pint of cold water, drink it and go to bed; it is one of the speediest remedies known.—The same will revive a person who seems almost dead from a heavy fall, &amp;c. In an apoplectic fit not time should be lost in pouring salt and water down the throat, if sufficient sensibility remain to allow swallowing; if not, the head must be sponged with cold water until the senses return, when salt and water will completely restore the patient from the lethargy. In the fit the feet should be placed in warm water, with mustard added, and the legs briskly rubbed, all bandages removed from the neck, &amp;c. and a cool apartment procured if possible. In many cases of severe bleeding at the lungs, when other remedies fail, Dr. Rush found two teaspoonfuls of salt completely stayed the flow of blood.—In cases of bite from a mad dog, wash the part with strong brine for an hour, then bind on some salt with a rag. In toothache, warm salt and water held to the part and renewed two or three times will relieve in most cases. If the gums be affected, wash the mouth with brine; if the teeth be covered with tartar, wash them twice a day with salt and water.—In swelled neck wash the part with brine, and drink it also, twice a day until cured.—Salt will expel worms if used in the food in moderate degree, and aids digestion, but salt meet is injurious if much used.   
  
It is reasonable to suppose that what is most plentiful on earth, is most essential to the wants of man. But we in general invert the order of nature, placing the greatest value on those things that are difficult to obtain. We burrow in the earth to obtain gold from its bosom and consider it our all in all, whereas we can neither eat nor drink it. When sickness lays its clammy hand on man, he is not apt to look to simple water as a remedy for his disease, but like the Assyrian general when told by the prophet to bathe in Jordan, and be cured of his leprosy, he scouts the simplicity of the act and the medicine, and turns away. As it was with the Philistine warrior, so it is with men at the present day, with but few to retract wisely like him, their first doubtings. Simple salt, is almost a cure for every thing with sailors,—our landsmen would rather seek medicines that come from the Persian Gulf or the wilds of Hindostan.

In many cases of disordered stomach, a tea spoonful of salt is acertain  
cure. In the violent internal aching, termed cholic, add a tea spoonful  
of salt to a pint of cold water—drink it, and go to bed; it is one of the

In an apoplectic fit, no time should be lost in pouring down salt and

In toothache, warm salt and water held to the part, and renewed, two

wash the mouth with brine; ifthe teeth be covered with tarter, wash

Medical use of Salt. In many cases of  
disordered stomach, a teaspoonful of salt is  
a certain cure. In the violent internal pain,  
termed colic, a teaspoonful of salt dissolved  
in a pint of cold water, taken as soon as pos­  
sible, with a short nap immediately after, is  
one of the most effectual and speedy reme­  
dies known. The same will revive a person  
who seems almost dead from receiving a very  
heavy fall. &#x27; &#x27;  
In an apoplectic fit, no time should be lost

sibility remain to allow of swallowing; if not,  
the Head must be sponged with cold water,  
until the sense return, when salt will cotn-  
pletely restore the patient from the lethargy.  
In a fit the feet should be placed in warm  
water, with mustard added; and the legs  
briskly rubbed, all bandages removed from  
the neck, and a cool apartment procured if  
possible. In cases of severe bleeding at the  
&#x27;lungs, and when other remedies failed, Dr.  
Rush found that two teaspoonsful of salt com­  
pletely stayed the blood. -  
In toothache, warm salt and water held to  
the part, will relieve in most cases. If the  
gums be affected, wash the mouth with brine;  
if the teeth be covered with tartar, wash  
them twice a day with salt water.  
In swelled neck wash the part with brine,  
and drink it also twice a day until cured.

revive a person who seems almost dead  
f&#x27;om receiving a very heavy fall. In an  
apoplectic fit, no time should be lost

tartar, wash them twice a day with salt

wnrms, if used in the food moderately,

The Value of Salt. In many cases of  
disordered stomach, a teaspoonful of  
salt is a certain cure. In the violent  
internal aching, termed colic, add a  
teaspoonful of salt to a pint of cold  
water, drink it; and go to bed; it ia  
one o£ the speediest remedies known. The  
same will revive a porson who seems  
almost dead from receiving a.heavy fall,  
&amp;c. In an apoplectic fit no time should  
be lost in pouring down salt water, i£  
sufficient sensibility remains to allow  
of swallowing; if not, the head must be  
sponged with cold water with mustard  
added, and the legs briskly rubbed, all  
bandages removed from the. neck,, and a  
cool apartment procured if possible. In  
many cases of bleeding at the lungs,  
when other remedies fail, Dr. Rush found  
two teaspoonfuls of salt completely  
stayed the blood. In case of bite from a  
mad dog, wash the part with strong brine  
for an hour, then bind on some salt with  
a rag. In toothache warm salt and water  
held to tho part, and renewed two or  
three times will relieve in most cases.  
If the gums be affected wash the mouth  
with brine. If the teeth be covered with  
tartar, wash twice a day with salt and&#x27;  
water. In swelled neck, wash the part  
with brine, and drink it twice a day,  
also, until cured. Salt will expel  
worms, if used in tlie food in a  
moderate degree, and aid digestion, but  
salt meat&#x27; is injurious if used much.
