In many cases of disordered stomach, a teaspoonful of salt taken three times a day is a certain cure. In the violent internal aching, termed cholic, add a tablespoonful of salt a pint of cold water, drink it and go to bed; it is one of the speediest remedies known.—The same will revive a person who seems almost dead from a heavy fall, &amp;c. In an apoplectic fit not time should be lost in pouring salt and water down the throat, if sufficient sensibility remain to allow swallowing; if not, the head must be sponged with cold water until the senses return, when salt and water will completely restore the patient from the lethargy. In the fit the feet should be placed in warm water, with mustard added, and the legs briskly rubbed, all bandages removed from the neck, &amp;c. and a cool apartment procured if possible. In many cases of severe bleeding at the lungs, when other remedies fail, Dr. Rush found two teaspoonfuls of salt completely stayed the flow of blood.—In cases of bite from a mad dog, wash the part with strong brine for an hour, then bind on some salt with a rag. In toothache, warm salt and water held to the part and renewed two or three times will relieve in most cases. If the gums be affected, wash the mouth with brine; if the teeth be covered with tartar, wash them twice a day with salt and water.—In swelled neck wash the part with brine, and drink it also, twice a day until cured.—Salt will expel worms if used in the food in moderate degree, and aids digestion, but salt meet is injurious if much used.

Medical use of Salt. In many cases of  
disordered stomach, a teaspoonful of salt is  
a certain cure. In the violent internal pain,  
termed colic, a teaspoonful of salt dissolved  
in a pint of cold water, taken as soon as pos­  
sible, with a short nap immediately after, is  
one of the most effectual and speedy reme­  
dies known. The same will revive a person  
who seems almost dead from receiving a very  
heavy fall. &#x27; &#x27;  
In an apoplectic fit, no time should be lost  
in pouring down salt water, if sufficient sen­  
sibility remain to allow of swallowing; if not,  
the Head must be sponged with cold water,  
until the sense return, when salt will cotn-  
pletely restore the patient from the lethargy.  
In a fit the feet should be placed in warm  
water, with mustard added; and the legs  
briskly rubbed, all bandages removed from  
the neck, and a cool apartment procured if  
possible. In cases of severe bleeding at the  
&#x27;lungs, and when other remedies failed, Dr.  
Rush found that two teaspoonsful of salt com­  
pletely stayed the blood. -  
In toothache, warm salt and water held to  
the part, will relieve in most cases. If the  
gums be affected, wash the mouth with brine;  
if the teeth be covered with tartar, wash  
them twice a day with salt water.  
In swelled neck wash the part with brine,  
and drink it also twice a day until cured.  
Salt water expels worms, if used in the  
food moderately, and aids digestion; battoo  
much salt meat is Injurious.

MEDICAL IME or SALT—In many cases of a dis­  
ordered stomach, a teaspoonful of salt is a certain  
care. In the violent internal aching, termed chol­  
ic, add a teaspoonful of sail lo a pint of cold water  
—drink it and go to bed—it is one ol the speediest  
remedies known. The same will revive a person  
who seems almost dead Irom teceiving a very hea­  
vy fall, &amp;o.  
In an apoplectic fit, no time should be lost in  
ponring down salt and water, if sufficient sensibili  
ty remain to allow ol swallowing, if not the head  
must be sponged with cold water until the senses  
return, when salt will completely restore the pa  
tienl irom the lethargy  
In a fit, the feet should be placed in warm wa­  
ter, with mustard added, the legs briskly rubbed,  
all bandages removed from the neck, and a cool  
apartment procured if possible. In many cases ol  
severe bleeding at the lungs, and when other re­  
modies fail, Dr. Resh found two teaspoonfuls of  
suit completely stayed the blood.  
In case of a bite from a mad dog, wash the part  
with strong brine for an hour, then bind on some  
salt with a rag.  
In toothache, warm salt and water he&#x27;d to the  
part, and renew two or three times, will relieve in  
most cases If the gums be aflected wash the  
mouth with bine; if the teeth bs covered with  
tartar, wash diem twice a day with salt and wa  
ter.  
In swelled neck, wash the part with brine, and  
diink it twice a day until cured.  
Salt will expel worms, if used in lood in a mod.  
erate degree, and aids digestion ; but salt meat is  
injurious il used much.

sponged with cold water until the senses

the patient from his lethargy. In a fit  
the feet should be placed in warm water,  
with mustard added, and the legs briskly  
rubbed, all bandages removed from the  
neck and a cool apartment procured if  
possible. In many cases of severe  
bleeding at the lungs, and when other  
remedies failed, Dr. Bush found that  
two teaspoonfuls of salt completely  
stayed the blood. In case of a bite from  
a mad dog wash the part with brine for  
an hour, and then bind on some salt  
with a rag. In toothache, warm salt and  
water held to the part and renewed two  
or three times, will relieve it in most

the mouth with brine. If the teeth be
