 to the rest from the Currents above-mentioned. If, however, your People, as they are rich, can afford it, and may be willing to indulge themselves, should chuse to keep up a constant Fire in the Winter Months, you may have from hence a Machine for the purpose, cast from the same Patterns with those now used at the Bank, or that in Lincoln’s-Inn Hall, which are placed in the middle of the respective Rooms. The Smoke of these descends, and passing under ground rises in some Chimney at a distance. Yours must be a Chimney built I suppose without the House; and as it ought to draw well, to prevent your being troubled with Smoke (as they often are at the Bank) it should be on the South side; but this I fear would disfigure your Front. That at Lincoln’s-Inn Hall draws better. They are in the Form of Temples, cast in Iron, with Columns, Cornishes, and every Member of elegant Architecture.

ince so just an Estimation of the Writers, as to strip them of all their deluded Friends, and demolish effectually their Interest and Influence. The Letters might be shown even to some of the Governor’s and Lieutenant Governor’s Partizans; and spoken of to every body; for there was no Restraint proposed to Talking of them, but only to copying. And possibly, as distant Objects seen only through a Mist appear larger, the same may happen from the Mystery in this Case. However this may be, the Terms given with them, could only be those with which they were received. There is still some Chance of procuring more, and some still more abominable.  
The great Defect here is in all sorts of People a want of Attention to what passes in such remote Countries as America; an Unwillingness even to read any thing about them, if it appears a little lengthy; and a Disposition to postpone the Consideration of the Things they know they must at last consider; that so they may have time for what more immediately concerns them, and withal enjoy their Amusement and be undisturb’d in the universal Dissipation. In other Respects, tho’ some of the Great regard us with a jealous Eye, and some are angry with us, the Majority of the Nation rather wish us well, and have no Desire to infringe our Liberties. And many console themselves under the Apprehensions of declining Liberty here, that they or th

defect here,’ he wrote from London in July, 1773, ‘is in all  
sorts of people a want of attention to what passes in such  
remote countries as America, an unwillingness to read any-  
thing about them if it appears a little lengthy, and a disposi-  
tion to postpone the consideration even of the things they  
know they must at last consider, so that they may have time  
for what more immediately concerns them, and withal enjoy  
their amusements, and be undisturbed in the universal dissi-  
pation.’  
  
‘ They read,’ adds Sir George Trevelyan, ‘as little as they could help,  
and, when they did read, they were informed by the debates in Parlia-  
ment that the farmers and backwoodsmen of the West, if they were per-  
mitted to manufacture in iron, in cotton, and in wool, and to export the  
produce of their labour all over the world, would speedily kill the indus-  
tries of Leeds and Manchester and Sheffield. And they learned from th

unwarrantableness of asserting or insinuating what they knew to be false and  
injurious, they justified themselves from the necessity of the thing; the  
public interest, the safety of the people, making it absolutely necessary that  
his weight and influence among them should by any means whatever be  
destroyed.’ Further, if Hutchinson’s testimony in his own case is not to be  
received, what are we to say of Franklin’s suspicious hint, who, in transmitting  
the letters, counsels the use of mystery and manceuvring, that, ‘as distant  
objects seen only through a mist appear larger, the same may happen from the  
mystery in this case.’ There never were cooler heads than stood on the  
shoulders of some of those leaders; it is impossible to think that they were  
blinded.”
