<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

The following poem, translated from the Russian of Derzhavin, is scarcely equalled in grandeur and sublimity by any poem in any language. We take it from a work entitled &#x27;Specimens of the Russian Poets,&#x27; translated by John Bowring.—*Conn. Ob.*  
  
O thou eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide;  
Unchanged thro&#x27; time&#x27;s all devastating flight.  
Thou only God! There is no God beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
Who none can comprehend and none explore;  
Who fill&#x27;st existence with *Thyself* alone:  
Embracing all,—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more.  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean—deep—may count  
The sands of the sun&#x27;s ray—but, God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure:—none can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries; Reason&#x27;s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark:  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high;  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, their existence;—Lord! on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation:—all  
Sprung forth from Thee:—of light, and joy, harmony,  
Sole origin:—all life, all beauty Thine.  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glorious! Great  
Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate!  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround:  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss:  
They own Thy power, accomplish thy command;  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
What shall we call them! Piles of crystal light—  
A glorious company of golden streams—  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright—  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams?  
But Thou to these art as the noon to night.  
  
Yes! As a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost:  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what am I then? Heavens unnumbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance weighed  
Against thy greatness, is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am I then? Nought!  
  
Nought! But the effluence of thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reach&#x27;d my bosom too;  
Yes! in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine  
As shines the sun-beam in a drop of dew.  
Now but I live, and one hope&#x27;s pinions fly  
Eager towards thy presence; for in Thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high.  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity  
I am, O God! and surely *Thou* must be!  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding then to Thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart:  
Though but an atom &#x27;midst immensity,  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!  
I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land!  
  
The chain of the being is complete in me;  
In me is matter&#x27;s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is spirit—Deity!  
I can command the lightening, and I am dust!  
A monarch, and a slave; a worm, a God!  
Whence came I here and how? so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown! this clod  
Lives surely through some energy;  
For from itself alone it could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy word  
Created *me!* Thou source of life and good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plenitude,  
Filled me with an immortal soul to spring  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its source—to—Thee—it&#x27;s Author there.  
  
O thoughts ineffable! O visions blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And waft its homage to Thy Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
Thus seek Thy presence—Being wise and good!  
Midst Thy vast works admire, obey, adore;  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

O 1 hou Eternal Ore ! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide ;  
I Unchang’d through Tune’s all-devastating flight;

Beiiig above all beings ! Mighty One !  
VVhoiue none can comprehend and none explore ;

Jieing whom ive call G 0 D—and know no more.  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands or the sun’s rays—but God ! for thee  
There is no weight nor measure ; none can moui  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason’s brightest spark.  
Though kmdi&lt; cMjy thy light, in vain would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark :  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high.  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, then existence :—l.ord, on tl*ee

Sprung forth from Thee :—of light, joy, harmonv,

And thought is lost ere thought can soar to

Eternity had its foundation : all  
Sprung forth from thee :—of light, joy, har­

Thy word created all, and doth create :  
Thy splendour nils all space with rays divine.  
Thob art, and wert, and shalt be, glorious !

Life-giving, life-sustaining potentate !  
Thy chains the unmtas.ir&#x27;d Universe surround ;  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspir&#x27;d with

Jlnd beautifully mingled life and death !

So suns are bom, so worlds spring forth from

And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of heaven’s bright army glitters in thy  
praise.  
A million torches lighted by thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss ;  
They own thy power, accomplish thy com­  
mand,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
What shall we call them ? Files of chrystal  
light ?  
A glorious company of golden streams ?  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright ?  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous  
beams ? .  
But Thou to these art as the noon to night.  
Yes ! as a drop of water in the sea’,  
All Ibis magnificence in Tliee is lost.  
What are ten thousand worlds, compar&#x27;d to  
Thee ?  
And wbr.t am I, then ? Heaven&#x27;s unnum­  
-1 ber’d host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and array’d  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance, weigh&#x27;d

Nought I but I live, and on hope’s pinions fly  
Eager towards thy presence : for in Thee  
1 live, and breathe, and dwell g aspiring high,  
Even to the throne of thy divinity.  
I am, O God ! and surely thou must be !  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding then to Thee ;  
Control my spirit, guide my wamFriug heart;  
Though but an atom &#x27;midst immensity,

I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven and  
earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their  
birth.  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land!  
The chain of being is complete in me ;  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost.  
And the next step is spirit—Deity !  
I can command the lightning, and am dust!  
A monarch, and a slave ; a worm, a God !  
Whence came I here, and how ? so marvel­

For from himself alone it could not be.-

There is no weigbt nor measure ; none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries: Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by thy light, in vain would try  
To trace thy councils, infinite and dark ;  
And thought is lost e’er thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness, didst call  
  
First chaos, then existence—Lord on thee  
Eternity had its foundation ; all  
  
Sprang forth from thee ; of light, joy, harmony,

Upheld by thee, by thee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upward from the firey blaze,  
So suns are born,so worlds spring forth from thee!  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of Heaven’s bright army glitters in thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by thy hand,  
  
Wander unweafied through the blue abyss;

What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what ain I then? Heaven’s unnumbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,

Direct my understanding then to thee ;  
  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart ;

All space doth occupy—all motions guide ;

Unchanged through Time’s all devastating flight—  
Thou ouly God! There is no God beside,  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!

There is no weight nor measure; none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason’s brightest spark,  
Thoush kindled by thy light, in vain would try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark:  
  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call

Eternity had its foundation : all  
  
Sprung forth from thee—of light, joy, harmony,

They own thy power, accomplish thy command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light?

O Tuov Eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth oceupy—all motion guide—  
Unchanged through time’s all devastating flight—  
Thou only God! There is no God beside !  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
Whom none can comprehend and none ex plore ;  
Who fill’st existence with thyself alone;  
Embracing all, supporting, ruling o’er—  
  
Being whom we call God—and know no more!  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands or the sun’s rays—but God! for thee  
There is no weight nor measure ; none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by thy light, in vain would try  
| &#x27;To trace thy counsel infinite and dark ;  
  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
  
  
| Thou from primeval nothingness didst call,  
First chaos then existence ; Lord, on thee  
Eternity had its foundation; all  
  
Sprung from thee ; of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin; all life all beauty thine,  
  
Thy word created all and doth create ;  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine ;  
Thou art and wert, and shall be, glorious!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining, Potentate !  
  
Thy chains th’ unmeasured Universe surround,  
Upheld by thee, by thee inspired with breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound.  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze  
So suns are born, so words spring forth from thee,  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays,  
  
Shine round the silver snow ; the pageantry  
Of heaven’s bright army glitters in thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by thy hand,  
Unwearied wander through the blue abyss;  
They own thy power, accomplish thy command,  
  
Great |  
  
ceeentnanemmnadaniatiomentedina  
  
  
  
————  
  
  
  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
  
Iz but an item in the balance weighed  
Against thy greatness-—is a cypher, brought  
Against infinity! What am I, then? Nought.  
  
Nought !—but the effulgence of thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds hath reached my bcescm tco.  
Yes! In my spirit doth thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Nought!—but I live, and on hope’s pinion fly  
Eager toward thy presence; for in thee  
I live and breathe, and dwell: aspiring high,  
Even to the throne of thy Divinity,  
Iam, O Gop! and surely Tuou must be!  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding, then, to thee :  
Control my spirit, guide my wand’ring heart;  
Though but an atom, ’midst immensity,  
Still, Iam something fashioned by thy hand!  
I hold a middle rank *twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close on the realms where angelshave their birth  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land ?  
  
  
  
The chain of being is complete in me;  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is spirit— Deity!  
  
1 can command the lightning, and am dust!  
A monarch and aslave, a worm, a god!  
  
Whence came I here, and how? so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived! unknown? This clod  
Lives surely through some higher energy,  
  
For from himeelfalone it could not be.

Yes! as a drop of wa‘er ta the sea,  
  
Yilthis magnificence ia Thee is lost.

Though multiplied by myriads, and*arayed  
  
In all the glory of sublimest thoughi,  
  
Is but an atom iu the ballance weighed  
  
Against Thy greatness, is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am I-thea? Naught!  
  
Naught! But the effluence of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reach’d my bosom too;  
Yes! In my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Naught! But I live, and on hope’s pinions fly  
Eager towards Thy presence; for in ‘Thee

On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
  
Close to the realms where angles have their bir-h,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit-land !  
  
The chain of being is complete in me ;  
  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost,  
  
And the next step is spirit—Deity !

Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plenitude,  
Fill’d me with an immorial soul, to spring  
O&#x27;er the abyss of death, and bid it wear

Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround.  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning, with the end hast bound,

As sparks mount upward from the fiery Wax/&#x27;,  
So suns are born* so worlds spring forth from Thee!  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays

What shall we call them ? Piles of chrystal lighl&#x27;  
A glorious company of golden streams ?  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright ?  
Suns, lighting systems with their joyous beams ?  
But Thou, to those, art as the noon to night.  
Yes! as a drop of water in the Sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost : ?  
What are a thousand Worlds compared to Thee? i

Creator! Yes ! Thy Wisdom and Thy Word  
Created me! Thou source of Life and Good !  
Tiiou Spirit of my spirit, and my Lord !  
Thy Light, Thy Love, in their bright plenitude

Even in its source, to Thee, its Author, Thee.  
O thought ineffable ! 0 vision blest!  
(Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee.)  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast, |  
And waft its homage to the Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar; !  
Thus seek thy presence. Being wise and good !  
Midst thy vast works, admire, obey, adore;

Trie Soul shall speak in tears of gratitude

Thou only God! there is no God beside!  
  
Brine awove Att Beines! Mighty One!

Thy splendor fills all sjace with rays divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be glorious !  
  
Life-giving, life-sustaining, Potentate  
  
! great :  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround :  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!  
Thou the begining, with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled Life and De;ith!  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze.  
So suns are born, so worlds sprang forth from Thee!  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of Heaven&#x27;s bright army, glitters iu Thy praise.  
A million torches light ed by Thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss ;  
Thy own Thy power, accomplish Thy command.  
AH gay with life, all eloquent with bliss ;  
What shall we call them 1 Piles of crystal light,  
A glorious company of golden streams 1  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright 1  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams 1  
But Thou, to those, art as the noon to-night !  
Yes ! as a drop of water in the Sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost :  
What are a thousand Worlds compared to Thee ?  
And what am I, when Heaven&#x27;s unnumbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought.  
Is but an atom in the balance, weighed  
Against Thy Greatness in a cypher brought  
Against Infinity 1 What am 1 1 Nought.  
Nought ! but the efficiency of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too ;  
Yes, in my spirit, doth Thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Nought ! but I live, and on Hope&#x27;s pinions fly,  
Eager towards Thy presence ; for in Thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell, aspiring high,  
Even to throne of Thy divinity  
I am, O God, and surely Thou must be.  
Thou art ! directing, guiding all. Thou art !  
Direct my understanding then to Thee ;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart ;  
Though but an atom &#x27;midst immensity,  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand !  
I hold a middle rank, &#x27;twist Heaven and Earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to tho realm where Angles have their birth,  
Just on the boundary of the spirit land !  
The chain of being is complete in me ;  
In mo is matter&#x27;s last graduation lost,  
And the next step is spirit Deity !  
I can command the lightning, and am dust !  
Whence came I here, and how 1 so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived, unknown 1 This clod  
Lives surely through some higher energy ;  
For from itself alone it could not be.  
Creator ! Yes ! Thy Wisdom and Thy Word  
Created me ! Thou source of Life and Good !  
Thou Spirit of ray spirit, and my Lord !  
Thy Light, Thy Love, in their bright plenitude  
Filled me with an immortal Soul, to spring  
Over the abyss of Death, and bade it wear  
The garments of Eternal Day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even iu its source, to Thee, its Author, Thee.  
O thought ineffable. O vision blest !  
(Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee,)  
Yet shall thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And waft its homage home to the Deity.  
God ! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar ;  
Thus seek Thy presence. Being wise and good !

And when the Tongue is eloquent no more,  
The Soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

been translated into Jaapnese, by order of the

have lost much of its original beauty by the trans- i

r ease obtained ;  
Ages past, yet still he languished :  
Ages came, and ages past,  
Still the bolts and chains were fast.  
  
Ages past; still Force and Strength  
Held their victim, justice scorning ;  
  
But the dawn appears at length,  
Ushering the glorious morning  
  
When nor Strength nor Force shall bind  
  
Fetters round the free-born mind.  
  
What does this old fable teach ?—  
Throwing off the rude dominion  
Of brute Force, free Mind shall reach  
Heights unsealed by soaring pinion,  
Love and Duty leading on  
To the footstool of God&#x27;s throne.

WRITTEN BY THE RUSSIAN POET, DERZHAVEN.  
O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide,  
Unchanged through &quot;Time&#x27;s all-devastating flight,  
Thou only-God! there is no God beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One !  
Whom none can comprehend, and none explore;  
Who fill’st existence with Thyself alone—  
  
Jane Asusy.  
  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er—  
  
Being whom we call God—and know no more!  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands, or the sun’s rays—but, God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure—none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries ; Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thygight, in vain may try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark ;  
  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
  
First, chaos—then, existence— Lord, on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation—all  
  
Sprang forth from Thee—of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin—all life, all beauty Thine—  
  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine:  
  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glorious! great!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining Potentate !  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround—  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath:  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
  
As sparks mount upwards from the fiery blaze,  
  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee ;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
  
Of Heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in Thy praise.  
  
A million torches, lighted by Thy hand,  
  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss ;  
  
They own Thy power, accomplish Thy command,  
  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light ?*  
A glorious company of golden streams ?  
  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright ?  
  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams &gt;—  
But Thou to these art as the noon to night!  
  
Yes, as a drop of water in the sea,  
  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost !  
  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what am I, then? Heaven’s unnumbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
  
Is but an atom in the balance, weighed  
  
Against Thy greatness—is a cipher brought  
  
Against Infinity! O, what am I, then? Nought!  
  
Nought ! yet the effluence of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too;  
And in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Nought! yet I live, and on Hope’s pinions fly  
Eager towards Thy presence: for in Thee  
  
I live, and breathe, and dwell: aspiring high,  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity :—  
  
Iam, O God, and surely Thou must be !  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, Thou art !  
  
Direct my understanding, then, to Thee ;  
  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart :  
Though but an atom ’midst immensity,  
  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!  
  
I hold a middle rank ’twixt heaven and earth,  
  
On the last verge of mortal Being stand,  
  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth—  
Just on the boundary of the spirit land!  
  
The chain of being is complete in me;  
  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost :  
  
And the next step is spirit—Deity !  
  
I can command the lightning, and am dust!  
  
A monarch, and a slave—a worm, a God!  
  
Whence came I here? and how so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived? Unknown! This clod  
Lives surely through some higher energy,  
  
For from itself alone it could not be.  
  
Creator! Yes, Thy wisdom and Thy word  
Created me! Thou Source of life and good!  
Thou Spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
  
Thy light, thy love, in their bright plenitude,  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to spring  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
The garment of eternal day, and wing  
  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its souree—to Thee—its author there.  
  
O, thought ineffable! ©, vision blest !  
Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And waft its homage to thy Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
Thus seek thy presence—Being wise and good ;  
&quot;Midst thy vast works admire, obey, adore ;  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude

GENUINE TRANSLATION.  
“Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, then existence—Lord, on thee  
Eternity had its foundation—all  
Sprung forth from thee: of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin: all life, all beauty thine.

Poetry.  
THE ALMIGHTY.  
[The following sublime ode to the Supreme  
Being is translated from the Russian. It was  
written by ono of their most distinguished poets,  
Derzhauir. This ode is said to have been trans­  
• lated into the Chinese and Tartar languages,  
written on rich silk and suspended in the im­  
perial palace at Pekin. The Emperor of Japan  
had it translated into the Japanese, embroidered  
in gold, and hung in the Temple of Jeddo. It is  
gratifying to learn that these nations have done  
themselves the honor to bestow such praise on  
this noble composition.]  
O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide;  
Unchanged through Time&#x27;s all devastating flight,  
Thou ony God! There is no God beside.  
Being above all beings! Mighty one!

plore ;  
Who fill&#x27;st existence with thyself alone :  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er—  
Being whom we cal! God—and know no more!  
In its sublime research, Philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep; may count  
The sands or the sun&#x27;s rays; but. God, for thee  
There is no v eight nor measure; none can  
mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason&#x27;s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by the light in vain would try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite the dark.  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
E&#x27;en like past moments in eternity.  
Thou, from primeval nothingness, didst call  
First t haos. then Existence. Lord, on thee  
Eternity had its foundation; all

Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its source—to thee, its Author, thee.  
Oh thought ineffable ! Oh vision blest!  
(Though worthless our conceptions all of thee);  
Yet shall thy shadowed image liil our breast,  
And wait its homage to the Diety.  
God ! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
Thus seek thy presence. Being wise and good,

And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall spes.k in tears of gratitude.

## [ODE TO THE CREATOR. I](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/149434490)

#### From _Jewish Herald (Vic. : 1879 - 1920)_

#### 1880-06-04 &middot; Melbourne, Victoria

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

ODE TO THE CREATOR.  0 Thou ! Eternal  
one ! whose presence bright All space  
doth occupy, all motion guide ;  
Unchanged through time&#x27;s all devastating  
flight, Thou only God !—there is no God  
beside. Being above all beings—Mighty  
one, Whom none can comprehend and none  
explore, Who fill&#x27;st existence with  
Thyself alone ; Embracing  
all—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er, Being whom  
we call God, and know no more. II In its  
sublime research—philosophy May measure  
out the ocean deep, May count the sound  
and the sun&#x27;s rays ; But God ! for thee  
there is no weight nor measure; None can  
mount up to Thy mysteries. Reason&#x27;s  
brightest spark though kindled by thy  
light, In vain would try to trace Thy  
counsels infinite and dark, And thought  
is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity, III.  
Thou from primeval nothingness did&#x27;st  
call first chaos, then existence, Lord !  
on Thee eternity had its foundation ;  
All spring forth from Thee, of light,  
joy, gladness, All life—all beauty  
Thine. Thy word created and doth create,  
Thy splendour fills all space with rays  
divine, Thou art—and wert—and shalt be  
Glorious! Great! Lifegiving—life-  
sustaining potentate. IV. Thy chains the  
unmeasured universe surround, Upheld by  
Thee, by Thee inspired with breath ;  
Thou the beginning with the end hast  
bound, And beautifully mingled life and  
death. As sparks mount upwards from the  
fiery blaze, So suns are born and worlds  
spring forth from Thee; &amp;nbsp; And as  
the spangles in the sunny rays Shine  
round the silver snow, the pageantry Of  
Heaven&#x27;s bright array glitters it Thy  
praise. V. A million torches lighted by  
Thy hand, Wander unwearied through the  
blue abyss, They own Thy power,  
accomplish Thy commands, All gay with  
life, All eloquent with bliss ; What  
shall we call them—piles of chrystal  
light? A glorious canopy of golden  
streams ? Lamps of celestial ether  
burning bright ? Suns lighting systems  
with their golden beams ? But Thou to  
these art as the noon to night! VI. Yes!  
as a drop of water in the sea, All this  
magnificence in Thee is lost, What are  
ten thousand worlds compared with Thee ?  
And what am I, then ? Heaven&#x27;s  
unnumbered host, though multiplied by  
myriads, And arrayed in all the glory of  
sublimist thought, Is but an atom in the  
balance weighed against Thy greatness—  
But a cypher brought against infinity.  
What am I, then ? Naught! VII. Naught  
but the effluence of thy light divine  
(Pervading worlds) has reached my bosom  
too; In my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Naught I but I live and on hope&#x27;s  
pinions fly Eager towards Thy presence ;  
For in Thee I live and breathe and  
dwell, Aspiring high, even to the throne  
of thy mag-nificence. I am, 0 God!—then  
surely Thou must be. &amp;nbsp; VIII. Thou  
art directing, guiding all; Thou art ;  
Direct my understanding then to Thee,  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering  
heart, Though but an atom &#x27;midst  
immensity, Still I am something  
fashioned by thy hand. I hold a middle  
rank twixt heaven and earth; On the last  
verge of mortal being stand, Close to  
the realms where angels have their  
birth, Just on the bound&#x27;ry of the  
spirit land. IX. The chain of being is  
complete in me, In me is matter&#x27;s last  
gradation lost, And the next step is  
spirit !—deity ! I can command the  
lightning, yet am dust; A monarch and a  
slave—a god—a worm— Whence came I here ?  
and how ? So marvellously constructed  
and conceived. This clod lives surely  
through some higher energy, For out  
itself alone—it could not be. X.  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy word  
created &amp;nbsp; me ; Thou source of light  
and life, Thou Spirit, of my spirit, and  
my God! &amp;nbsp; Thy life ! Thy love ! in  
their bright plenitude, Fill me with  
immortal soul to spring Over the abyss  
of death and bade it wear The garments  
of eternal light, And wing its heavenly  
flight Even to its source—to Thee—it&#x27;s  
author there. &amp;nbsp; XI, O thought  
ineffable ! O vision blest ! Though  
worthless our conception all of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our  
breast, And waft its homage to Thy  
deity. God ! Thus alone our lowly  
thoughts can soar; &amp;nbsp; Thus seek Thy  
presence !—Being ! wise and good! &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; Midst Thy vast works  
admire—obey—adore— And when the tongue  
is eloquent no more, &amp;nbsp; The soul  
shall speak in tears its gratitude.

Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning with the end has bound.

As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze.  
So suns are bom; so worlds spring forth from

GOD.  
  
0 thou eternal One! whose presence  
bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide  
Unchanged through time&#x27;s all-devastat­  
ing flight!  
Thou only God—there Is no god beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One,  
Whom none can comprehend and none  
explore!  
Who flll&#x27;st existence with thyself alone,  
Embracing all, supporting, ruling o&#x27;er—  
Being whom we call God, and know no  
more.  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean-deep—may  
count  
The sands or the sun&#x27;s rays—but, God!  
for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure none  
can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries Reason&#x27;s bright­  
est spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain  
would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and  
dark  
And thought is lost ere thought can  
soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst  
oall  
First chaos, then existence—Lord! in  
  
Thee  
  
Eternity had its foundations all  
Sprung forth from Thee—of light, joy,  
harmony,  
Sole Origin—all life, all beauty Thine,  
Thy word created&quot;all and doth create  
Thy splendor Alls all space with rays  
divine  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be, Glo­  
rious! Great!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining potentate!  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe  
surround—  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with  
breath  
Thou the beginning with the end hast  
bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upward from the  
fiery blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds soring  
forth from Thee  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pa­  
geantry  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in  
  
Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue  
abyss—  
They own Thy power, accomplish Thy  
command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with  
bliss.  
What shall we call them? Piles of  
crystal light—  
A glorious company of golden streams,  
Lamps of celestial ether burning  
bright—  
Suns lighting systems with their joy­  
ous beams?  
  
But Thou to these are as the noon to  
light,  
Yes, as a drop of water In the sea,  
All this magnificence In The is lost—  
What are ten thousand worlds compar­  
ed to Thee?  
And what am I, then?—Heaven&#x27;s un­  
numbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads and ar­  
rayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance, weighed  
Agoinst thy greatness, is a cipher  
brought  
Against Infinity! What am I, then?  
  
Naught.  
  
Naught! But the effluence of Thy light  
divine.  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my  
bosom, too  
Yes In my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of  
dew.  
Naught! but I live, and on hope&#x27;s pin­  
ions fly  
Eager toward Thy presence—for in  
  
Thee  
  
1 live and breathe, and dwell aspiring  
high,  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity.  
I am, O God, and surely Thou must be!  
  
Thou art Idirecting, guiding all—Thou  
art!  
Direct my understanding then to Thee  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering  
heart  
Though but an atom &#x27;midst immensity,  
Still I am something fashioned by Thy  
hand!  
I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven  
and earth—  
On the last verge of mortal being stand  
Close to the realms where angels have  
their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit  
land!  
  
The chain of being is complete in me—  
In me is matter&#x27;s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is spirit—deity!  
I can command the lightning, and am  
dust!  
A monarch and a slave—a worm, a god!  
Whence came I here, and how? so  
marvelously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown  
this clod  
Lives surely through some higher en­  
ergy  
For from itself alone It could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy  
word  
Created me! Thou source of life ano  
good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright  
plentitude  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to  
spring  
Over the abyss of death and bade it  
wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little  
sphere,  
EVen to Its source—to Thee—Its authoi  
there.  
O, thoughts ineffable! O, visions blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions ah  
of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill oux  
breast,  
And waft its homage to Thy deity.  
God! Thus alone my lonely thoughts  
can soar,  
Thus seek Thy presence—being wise  
and good!  
  
Midst Thy vast works admire, obey,  
adore.  
And when the tongue is eloquent no  
more  
The soul shall speak in tears of grati­  
tude
