n Bowring.—*Conn. Ob.*  
  
O thou eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide;  
Unchanged thro&#x27; time&#x27;s all devastating flight.  
Thou only God! There is no God beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
Who none can comprehend and none explore;  
Who fill&#x27;st existence with *Thyself* alone:  
Embracing all,—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more.  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean—deep—may count  
The sands of the sun&#x27;s ray—but, God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure:—none can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries; Reason&#x27;s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark:  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high;  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, their existence;—Lord! on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation:—all  
Sprung forth from Thee:—of light, and joy, harmony,  
Sole origin:—all life, all beauty Thine.  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glorious! Great  
Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate!  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround:  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss:  
They own Thy power, accomplish thy command;  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
What shall we call them! Piles of crystal light—  
A glorious company of golden streams—  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright—  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams?  
But Thou to these art as the noon to night.  
  
Yes! As a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost:  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what am I then? Heavens unnumbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance weighed  
Against thy greatness, is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am I then? Nought!  
  
Nought! But the effluence of thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reach&#x27;d my bosom too;  
Yes! in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine  
As shines the sun-beam in a drop of dew.  
Now but I live, and one hope&#x27;s pinions fly  
Eager towards thy presence; for in Thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high.  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity  
I am, O God! and surely *Thou* must be!  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding then to Thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart:  
Though but an atom &#x27;midst immensity,  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!  
I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land!  
  
The chain of the being is complete in me;  
In me is matter&#x27;s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is spirit—Deity!  
I can command the lightening, and I am dust!  
A monarch, and a slave; a worm, a God!  
Whence came I here and how? so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown! this clod  
Lives surely through some energy;  
For from itself alone it could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy word  
Created *me!* Thou source of life and good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plenitude,  
Filled me with an immortal soul to spring  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its source—to—Thee—it&#x27;s Author there.  
  
O thoughts ineffable! O visions blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And waft its homage to Thy Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
Thus seek Thy presence—Being wise and good!  
Midst Thy vast works admire, obey, adore;  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

Thou from primeval nothingness dids¢ call  
  
First chaos, then existence ;— Lord, on  
Thee  
  
Eternity had its foundatien :—all  
  
Sprung forth from Thee :—of light, joy,

Sole origin :—-all life, all beauty Thine.  
  
Thy word created all, and doth create;

vine.  
  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glori-  
ous ! Great!

Thy chains the unmeasured universe sur-

Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with  
breath !  
  
Thou the beginning with the end hast  
bound,  
  
And beautifully mingled lite and death !  
  
As sparks mount upwards from the fiery  
blaze,  
  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth  
from Thee ;  
  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
  
Of heaven’s bright army glitters in Thy  
praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand

They own Thy power, accomplish ‘Thy

All gay with life, all-eloquent with bss.  
  
W hat shall we call them ? Piles of crystal

A glorious company of golden streams—  
  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright—  
  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous  
beams ?  
  
But Thou to these art as the noon to night.  
  
The following is equally worthy of  
  
praise. The last stanza, and parti-  
cwarly the couplet in italics, is ex-  
tremely fine.  
  
Yes ! as a drop of water in the sea,  
  
All this magniticence in Thee is lost :—  
  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to  
Thee ?  
  
And what am J then ? Heaven’s unnum-

Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed

There is no weight nor measure :—none can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries; Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark :  
  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call

Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround :  
Upheld by Thee, by [hee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,

So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays

Created me! Thou source of life and good!  
Thou Spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plenitude  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to spring

But Thou to these art as the noon to night.  
  
Yes! as a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost ;—  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what am J then? Heaven’s unnumber’d host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and urrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance weighed  
Against Thy greatness, is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am I, then ?-Nought:  
  
Nought! But the effluence of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds hath reach’d my bosom too;  
Yes! in my spirit doth thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sun-beam in a drop of dew.  
Nought! but ! live, and on Hope’s pinions fly  
Eager towards thy presence: for in Thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high,  
Even to the throne of thy divinity.  
I am, O God! and surely Thou must be!  
Theu art! directing, guiding all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding then to Thee ;  
Coutroul my spirit, guide my wandering heart :  
Though but an atom ’midet immensity,

I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
  
‘| Just on the boundaries of the spirit-Jand !  
  
The chain of being is complete in me ;  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is spirit—Deity !  
I can command the lightning, and am dust}  
A monarch, and a slave, a worm, a God!  
Whence came I} here, and how? so marvellously  
Constructed and conceiv’d? unknown! This clod  
Lives surely through eome higher energy ;  
For from himself alone it could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and thy word  
  
Created me! ‘Thou source of life and good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
  
‘Thy light, thy love, in their bright plenitude  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to spring  
  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
  
Even to its source—to Thee—its Author there.  
  
O thought ineffable! O visions blest!  
  
Though worthless our congeptions all of Thee,  
Yet shall thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
  
And waft its homage to thy Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
  
Thus seek thy presence— Being wise and good !

Thou only God ! There is no God beside !

M-iy measure out the ocean-deep—may count

Up to Thy mysteries; Reason&#x27;s brightest

Though kindled by Thy light, in vatu would

To trace Thy counsels, Infinite and dark :  
And thought is lost ere tbqiight can soar so

Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, then existence;—Lord I on Thee  
Eternity hid its foundation all  
Sprung forth from Thee of llg it, joy, bsrmo­

A million torches lighted by Thy hand

Th&quot;&#x27; editor of the Baltimore Mornin* Chron­  
ic’-e, in publishing the foHcwing sublime ode  
to the Supreme Being, remarks that &#x27;he  
knows not who is the author. We have  
the pleasure to inform him, that it is from  
the Russian Anthology, and was written  
by the celebrated Derzhavin, a sketch of  
•whose life was some time since published in  
the Statesman. This Poem is said to have  
been translated into Japanese, by order of  
the Farperour, and is hung up, embroidered  
in gold, in the Temple of Jeddo. It has  
also been translated into the Chinese and  
Tartar languages, written on a piece of rich  
silk, and suspended in the imperial palace  
at Pekin. It is a noble composition, worthy  
of all these honours.]  
GOD!  
3 THOU Eternal One! whose presence bright,  
All space doth occupy—all motion guide ;  
Unchang’d through Time&#x27;s all-devastating

Thou only God! There is no God beside.

Being whom we call G od—and know no more !  
Ie its sub!inie research, philosophy

There is no weight nor measure ; none cau

Up to thy mysteries. Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindl&#x27;d by thy light, in vain would

To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark :  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar to

Even like past moments in eternity.  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First, chaos, then existence—Lord, on thee  
Eternity had its foundation : all  
Sprung forth from thee :—of light, joy, har­  
mony,  
Sole origin—all life, all beauty, thine.  
Thy word created all, and doth create :  
Thy splendour nils all space with rays divine.  
Thob art, and wert, and shalt be, glorious !

Life-giving, life-sustaining potentate !  
Thy chains the unmtas.ir&#x27;d Universe surround ;

The following sublime ode to the Deity, is from the  
Russian Anthology, and was written by Derzhavin. It  
is said that this poem has been translated into Japanese,  
by order of the Emperor, and is hung up, embroidered  
in gold, in the Temple of Jeddo. It has also been  
translated into the Chinese and Tartar languages, writ-  
ten upon a piece of rich silk, and suspended in the im-  
perial palace at Pekin.  
  
O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright,

The following sublime Ode, to the Supreme Be-  
ing, is translated from the Russian. It was  
written by one of their most distin ished Po-  
ets, “ Dershanir... This Ode is s@id to have  
deen translated into the Chinese and Tartar lan-  
guages, written on rich silk, and suspended in  
the Imperial palace at Pekin. The Emperor of  
Japan had it translated into the Japanese, em-  
broidered in gold, and hung in the Temple of  
Jeddo. It is gratifying to learn that the na-  
  
’ tions have done themselves the honour to be-  
stow those honours on this noble composition.  
  
GOD.  
  
O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright,  
All space doth occupy.— All motion guide $  
Unchanged through time’s all devastating flight,  
Thou only God! There is no God beside.  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
  
Whom none can comprehend, and none explore,  
Who fillest existence with thyself alone ;  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more -  
  
In its sublime research, Philosophy,  
  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands o’er the sun’s rays—but Go ! for thee  
There is no weigbt nor measure ; none can mount

Poet’s Corner,  
  
  
  
The following sublime Ode, to the Supreme  
Being, is translate:&#x27; from the Russian—and tho’ it  
doubtless looses much of its original strength of  
expression, as do mv st trunslations, yet it retains  
rouch sublimity and grandeur. We cannot re-  
member of having ever read a composition on the  
same subject, containing equal merit in point of  
elevated conception. It was written by one of  
the most distinguished Russian Poets, ‘ Derzhunir.’  
This ode is said to have been translated into the  
Chinese and Tartar languages, written on rich silk  
and suspended in the Imperial palace, at Pekin.  
The Emperor of Japan had it translated into the  
Japanese, embroidered in gold, and hung in the  
Temple of Jeddo. It is gratifying to learn that  
these nations have done themselves the honor to  
bestow those honors on this noble composition.  
  
GOD.  
  
O Thou ETERNAL ONF! whose presence bright,  
All space doth occupy.—All motion guide :  
Unchanged through time’s all devastating flight,  
Thou only GOD! There is no God beside.  
BEING above all beings! MIGHTY ONE !  
Whom none can comprehend, and none explore,  
Who fillest existence with Thyself alone ;  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er—  
  
Being whom we call GOD—and know no more !  
  
In its sublime research, Philosophy,  
  
May measure out the ocean dcep—may count  
The sands or the sun’s rays—but GOD! fur Thee  
There is no weight nor measure ; none can mount  
Up to Thy mys eries: Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would try  
To trace Thy councils, infinite and dark ;  
  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity,  
  
Thou, from primeval nothingness, didst call  
First chaos, then existence—LORD, on ‘Thee  
Eternity had its foundation ; all  
  
Sprung forth from Thee; of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin—a!l life, all beauty, Thine,  
  
Thy word created all, and doth create ;  
  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be, glorious ! great !  
Life-giving, life-sustaining, Potentate !  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround ;  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!  
Thou, the beginning with the end, hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,  
So sunsare born, so worlds spring forth from thee!  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
  
Of Heaven’s bright army glitters in Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand,  
  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss ;  
They own thy power, accomplish Thy command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss :  
  
What shall we callthem? Piles of crystal light?  
A glorious company of golden streams ?  
  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright ?  
  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams ?  
But THOU to these art as the noon tonight!  
  
Yes ! as a drop of water in the sea,  
  
All this magnificence is lost in THEE :—  
What are ten thousand worlds compar&#x27;d to Thee? |  
And what am Ithen? Heaven’s unnumber’d host, |  
‘Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
  
In all the glory ofsublimest thought,  
  
Is but an atom in the balance weighed  
  
Against Thy greatness—is a cypher brought  
Against INFINITY ! what am I then ?—Nought !  
  
Nought !—but the effluence of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too;  
Yes, in my spirit doth Thy Spirit shine  
  
As shines the sun-beam in a drop of dew.  
  
Eager towards Thy presence ; for, in Thee  
  
I live, and breathe, and dwell ; aspiring high,  
Even tothe throne of Thy DIVINITY.  
  
Tam, O GOD, and surely THOU must be /  
  
Thou art!

All space doth occupy—all motion guide ;  
Unchang&#x27;d thro’ Time’s all devastating flight,  
  
Thou only God !—there is no God beside.  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
  
Whom none can comprehend, and none explore ;  
Who fill’st existence with Thyself alone;  
  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er—  
  
Being whom we call God—and know no more!  
  
In its sublime research, Philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands, or the sun’s rays—but, God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure ; none can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries. Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark :  
And thought is lost, ere thought can soar so high,

Thy word created all, and doth create:  
Thy splendour fills all space with rays divine.

Life-giving, life-sustaining potentate!  
  
Thy chains the unmeasur&#x27;d universe surround ;  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspir’d with breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!

So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of Heaven’s bright army glitters in thy praise.

Wander unwearied through the blue abyss;  
  
They own thy power, accomplish thy command,

There is no weight nor measure; none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason’s brightest spark,

First, chaos ; then, existence—Lord on thee  
Eternity had its foundation ; all

Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would Uy  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark:

Even like past momenU in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call

A million torches lighted by Thy hand

Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed

O, Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright,  
All space doth occupy—all motion guide :  
Unchanged through time’s all-everlasting flight,  
Thou only God: there is no God beside.  
Being above all beings ! Mighty one !  
Who none can comprehend, and none explore ;  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more!  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands, or the sun’s rays—but God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure ; none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries ; reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by thy light, in vain would try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark ;  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness did call  
First, chaos, then existence—Lord, on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation ; ‘all  
Sprung forth from Thee ; all light, joy, harmony,  
Sole Origin—all life, all beauty, thine,  
Thy word created all, and doth create:  
Thy splendor fills all space with raps divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! glorious! great!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining, potentate !  
  
Thy chains the unmeasure universe surround ;  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
As sparks mount upwards from the flery blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee,  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays,  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of Heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by thy hand  
Wander, unwearied, through the blue abyss ;  
  
They ownthy power, accomplish thy command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light ?  
A glorious company of golden streams ?  
  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright ?  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams !  
But Thou to these art as the moon to night.  
  
Yes! as a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificent in Thee is lost :—  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee ?  
And what am / then? Heaven&#x27;s unnumber&#x27;d host,  
Though multiplied by myriads and array&#x27;d  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance .weigh’d  
Against thy greatness—is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am J then ?—Nought.  
  
Nought—but the effluence of thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too!  
Yes, in my spirit doth Thy Spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Nought—But I live and on hope’s pinions fly  
Eager towards thy presence ; for in Thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell: I lift my eye  
Even to the throne of thy divinity :

Wander unwearied through the blue abyss;

All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss;  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light,

G OD.  
The following sublime ode to the Deity, is from the  
Russian authology, and was written by the celebratede  
Derzhaven. This poem is said to have been translai  
ted into Japanese, by order of the Emperor, and iso  
hung up embroidered in gold in the temple of Jeddo.  
It has also been translated into the Chinese and Tar­  
tar languages, written on a piece of rich silk, and e  
suspended in the Imperial Palace at Pekin. It was  
into English, as follows, by Dr. Bowring,  
and is said to have lost much of its original beauty by  
the translation. It is a noble composition, and should  
be preserved and committed to memory by every  
reader:

All space doth occupy all motion guide;

Thon only God! There is no God beside!  
Being above all beings! mighty one!  
Whom none can comprehend and none explore,  
Who fill&#x27;st existence with Thyself alone-­  
Embracing all--supporting--ruling o&#x27;er-­  
Being whom we call God--and be now no more  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep--may count  
The sands or the sun&#x27;s rays--but God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure--none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries; Reason&#x27;s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain may try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark;  
And thought is lost e&#x27;er thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
Thou from primeval nothingness did&#x27;st call  
First, chaos--then existence--Lord, on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation--all  
Sprang forth from Thee--of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin--all life, all beauty Thine,  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shall be! Glorious! Great!  
Life giving, life sustaining Potentate!  
Thy chains the unmeasured Universe surround-­  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upwards from the fiery blaze,  
So suns are born, so words spring forth from Thee;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays,  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in Thy praise.  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand,  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss;  
They own Thy power, accomplish Thy command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light?  
A glorious company of golden streams?  
amps of celestial ether burning bright?  
Sun&#x27;s lighting systems with their joyous beams?  
Put thou to these art as the noon to night!  
Yet as a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost;  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what am I, then? Heaven&#x27;s unnumbered host  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance weigher  
Against Thy greatness, is a cypher brought  
Against Infinity. What am I, then? nought!  
Nought!But the effluence of Thy light divine.  
Pervading worlds hath reached my bosom too;  
Yes, in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeams in a drop of dew,  
Nought! but I live, and on Hope&#x27;s pinions fly  
Eager towards Thy presence; for in Thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high,  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity,  
I am, O God! and surely Thou must be  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding, then, to Thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart  
Though but an atom midst immensity,  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!  
I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven and earth,  
I the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth  
Just on the boundary of the spirit land!  
The chain of being is complete in me  
In me is matter&#x27;s last gradation lost.  
And the next step is spirit- Deity  
I can command the lightning, and am dust!  
monarch and a slave--a worm, a God!  
Whence came I here? and how so marvelously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown! This clod  
Lives surely through some higher energy,  
For from itself alone it could not be  
Creator! Yes, thy wisdom and thy word  
Created me! Thou source of life and good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
Thy liaht. Thy love, in their bright plentitude  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to spring

Even to its source---to Thee--its author there.  
O thought ineffable! O vision blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions all of thee;  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And with its homage to the Deity.

GOD.  
  
The following sublime ode to the Deity, is from the  
Rassian Anthology, and was written by the celebrated  
Derzhaven. This poem is said to have been translated  
into Japanese, by order of the Emperor, and is hung  
up embroidered in gold in the temple of Jeddo. It  
has also been translated into the Chinese and Tartar  
  
, written on a piece of rich silk, and suspend-  
ed in the Imperial Palace at Pekin. It was translated  
into English, as follows, by Dr. Bowring, but is said  
to have lost much of its original beauty by the transla-  
tion. It is a noble composition, and should be pre-  
served by the reader.  
  
O Ereanat One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide ;  
Unchanged through Time’s all devastating flight,  
Thou only God! There is no God beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
  
Whom none can comprehend and none explore,  
  
Who fill’st existence with Thyself alone—  
Embracing ing—ruling o’er—  
Being whom we call God—and be now no more !  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands or the sun’s raye—but God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure—none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries ; Reason’s brightest spark,  
indled by Thy light, in vain may try  
  
ought is lost e’er thought can soar so high  
Even like past moments in eternity. 7”  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness did’st call  
  
First, chaos—then on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation—all  
  
Sprang forth from Thee—of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin—all life, all beauty Thine :  
  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
  
Thou art, and wert, and shall be! Glorious! Great !  
Life-giving, life-sustaining Potentate !  
  
chains th’ unmeasured Universe surronnd—  
  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath !  
Thon the beginning with the end hast bound, |  
  
And beautifally mingled life and death ! |  
  
As sparks mount upwards from the blaze,  
  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee ;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays,  
  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
  
Of heaven’s bright army glitters fa Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand,  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss ;  
They own Thy power, accomplish Thy command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
What shall we cail them ? Piles of crystal light ?  
A glorious company of golden streams ?  
  
of celestial ether burning bright ?  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams ?  
Bat Thou to these art_as the noon to night !  
  
Yet as a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost ;  
  
What are ten thousand worlds com to Thee ?  
  
what am I,then? Heaven’s unnumbered host,  
I  
  
hough multiplied by myriads, arrayed  
all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Ts but an atom in the balanve, weighed  
Against Thy greatness; is a cipher brought  
Against Infinity. What am I, then? naught !  
  
Naught !—Butthe effluence of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds hath reached my bosom too ;  
Yes, in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
  
As shines the sunbeams in a drop of dew.  
Naught ! but I live, and on Hope&#x27;s pinions fly  
Eager towards Thy presence ; for in Thee  
  
I live, aud breathe, and dwell ; aspiring high,  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity.  
  
I am. O God; and surely Thou must be!  
  
Thon art! directing, ing all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding, then, to [hee ;  
  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart ;  
Thongh bat an atom ’midst immensity,  
  
Still | am something, fashioned by Thy hand !  
  
I hold a middle rank ’twixt heaven and earth ;  
  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth—  
Just on the boundary of the spirit land !  
  
The chain of being is complete in me ;  
  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost,  
  
And the next step is spirit—Deity !  
  
I can command the lightning, and am dust !  
  
A monarch, and a slave—a worm, a God !  
  
Whence came I here? And how so marvelously  
Constructed and conceived ? Unknown! This clod  
Lives surely through some higher energy,  
  
For from itself alone it could not be.  
  
Creator! Yes, thy wisdom and thy word  
Created me! Thy source of life and good |  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord !  
  
Thy light, Thy love, ia their bright plenitude,  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to spring  
Over the abyss of Death, and bade it wear  
  
A garments of eternal day, and wing  
  
I venly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its source—to Thee—its sather there.  
  
O thought ineffable ! O vision blest |

Against Thy greatness—is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am I, then? Nought:  
  
Nought: But the effluence of thy light divine,

Yes; in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,

On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit-land!  
  
The chain of being is complete in me,—  
In me is matter&#x27;s last gradation lost :  
And the next step is spirit—deity!  
I can command the lightning, and ani dust;  
A monarch and a slave ; a worm, a god.  
Whence came I here? And how so marvelously  
Constructed, and conceived ?—Unknown. This clod  
Lives surely through sonic higher energy;  
For, from itself alone it could not be.  
Creator, yes; wisdom and Thy word  
Created me: source of life and good:  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my LORD ;  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plentitude,  
Filt&#x27;d me with an immortal soul to bring  
O&#x27;er the abyss of death and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
E?en to its source—to Thee—its Author there.  
  
0 thought ineffable! 0 vision blest !  
Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadow&#x27;d imago fill our breast,  
And waft its homage to Thy Deity.  
GOD, thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar,  
Thus seek Thy presence, Mixer wise and good;  
&#x27;Midst Thy vast works admire, obey, adore;  
And, when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall Speak in tears of gratitude.

Unchanged through time&#x27;s all-devustaiing

weight nor measure ; none can mount Up  
to Thy mysteries : Reason&#x27;s brightest  
spark. Tho&#x27; kiudledby Thy lieht, in vain  
would try To trace Thy counsels,  
infinito and dark, And thought is lost,  
ere thought can soar so high. Even like  
past moments in Eternity. Thou from  
primeval nothingness didst call First  
chaos, then existenco; Lord, on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation : all Sprung  
forth from Thee ; of light, joy,

inspired with breath ; Thou tho

ct here is the use of the  
simile. By its means the poet, in a  
single sentence, seems to reveal the  
whole mystery of the human soul.  
O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide

Thou only God, there is no God beside!

explore,

Being whom we call God--and know no  
more!  
In its sublime research, Philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep--may

There is no weight nor measure. None can  
moult  
Up to the mysteries. Reason&#x27;s brightest  
spark,  
Though kindled by the light, in vain  
would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark,  
And thought is lost, ere thought can soar  
so high,

Thou from primeval nothingness did&#x27;st call

Eternity had its foundation--all

And as the spangles in the sunny rays

“ODE TO GOD.”  
[The author of this ode was a Russian,  
born in 1768. After serving some time in  
the army he was made successively a coun­  
cilor of state, embassador of senate, presi­  
dent of the College of Commerce, and, in  
1802, minister of justice.  
The poem has  
been translated into Japanese by order of  
the Emperor, and is hung up, embroidered  
the Emperor, and is hung up,  
with gold, in the temple ot J  
eddo.  
It has  
•lso been translated into the Chinese and  
Tartar languages, written on a piece of rich  
silk, and suspended in the imperial pal­  
ace of Pekin.]  
O thou eternal one! whose presence bright.  
All space doth occupy—all motion guide,  
Unchanged through Time’s all devastating  
flight,  
Thou only God ! There is no God beside,  
Being above all icings! Mighty One!  
Whom none can comprehend and none  
explore;  
Who fill’st existence with thyself alone;  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er,  
Being whom we call God, and know no  
more!  
In its sublime research, Philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep—may  
count  
  
A lie S2ANB UI me suu s rays; uui,uua, lor  
thee  
There is no weight nor measure; none  
can mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Beason’s brightest  
spark,  
Though kindled by thy light, in vain  
would try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark ;  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar  
so high,  
E&#x27;en like past moments in eternity.  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, then existence. Lord, on  
thee  
Eternity’ had its foundation ; all  
Sprung forth from thee; of light, joy, har­  
mony,  
Sole origin—all life, all beauty, thine,  
Thy’ word created all, and doth create;  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays di­  
vine;  
Thou art and wert, and shall be glorious  
great  
Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate.  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe sur­  
round.  
Upheld by thee, by thee inspired by’  
breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hath  
bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery  
blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth  
from thee!  
And ns the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pagean­  
try  
Of heaven’s bright army glitters in thy  
praise.  
A million torches, lighted by thy hand,  
Wander unwearied through the blue  
abyss;  
They own thy power, accomplish thy com­  
mand,  
All gay with light, all eloquent with bliss  
What shall we call them? Piles of crys­  
tal light?  
A glorious company’ of golden streams?  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright ?  
Suns lighting systems w ith their joyous  
beams ?  
But thon to these art as the moon to night.  
Yet, as a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in thee is lost;  
What are ten thousand worlds compared  
to thee ?  
And what am I, then ? Heaven’s unnum­  
bered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads and arrayed  
in all the glory of subfimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance, weighed  
Against thy greatness, is a cipher brought  
Against infinity: What am I then ? Naught.  
Naught! But the effluence of thy light di­  
vine,  
Pervading worlds hath reached my bo­  
som, too;  
Yes, in my spirit doth thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Naught! But I live and on hope’s pinions  
fly  
Eager toward thy presence; for in thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring  
high,  
E’en to the throne of thy divinity’!  
I am, O God, and surely thou must be!  
Thou art; directing, guiding all; thou art!  
Direct my understanding, then to, thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering  
heart;  
Though but an atom ’midst immensity,  
Still I am something fashioned by thy hand  
I hold a middle rank, &#x27;twixt heaven and  
earth.  
On the last verge of mortal being stand  
Close to the realms where angels have  
their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land!  
The chain of being is complete.in me;  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is Spirit-Deity!  
I can command the lightning and am  
dust;  
  
a IOArCil aU a slave; a worm, a god.  
Whence came I here, and how! So mar­  
velously  
Constructed and conceived—unknown—  
this clod  
Lives surely through some higher energy  
For from itself alone it could not be.  
Creator! Yes! Thy wisdom and thy word  
Created me! Thou source of life and good,  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord;  
Thy light, thy love, in their bright pleni­  
tude,  
Filled me with an immortal soul to spring  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
5  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
its heavenly flight beyond this little  
sphere,  
E&#x27;en to its source, to thee, its author, there.  
O thought ineffable! O vision blest!  
(Though worthless our conceptions all  
of thee.)  
Yet shall thy shadow’d image fill my breast  
And waft its homage to thy Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can  
soar?  
Thus seeks thy presence, Being wise and  
good!  
&#x27;Midst thy vast works, admire, obey, adore,  
And when the tongue is eloquent no  
more,  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

one, Whom none can comprehend and none

Thyself alone ; Embracing  
all—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er, Being whom  
we call God, and know no more. II In its  
sublime research—philosophy May measure  
out the ocean deep, May count the sound  
and the sun&#x27;s rays ; But God ! for thee  
there is no weight nor measure; None can  
mount up to Thy mysteries. Reason&#x27;s  
brightest spark though kindled by thy  
light, In vain would try to trace Thy  
counsels infinite and dark, And thought  
is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity, III.  
Thou from primeval nothingness did&#x27;st  
call first chaos, then existence, Lord !  
on Thee eternity had its foundation ;  
All spring forth from Thee, of light,  
joy, gladness, All life—all beauty  
Thine. Thy word created and doth create,  
Thy splendour fills all space with rays  
divine, Thou art—and wert—and shalt be  
Glorious! Great! Lifegiving—life-  
sustaining potentate. IV. Thy chains the  
unmeasured universe surround, Upheld by  
Thee, by Thee inspired with breath ;  
Thou the beginning with the end hast  
bound, And beautifully mingled life and  
death. As sparks mount upwards from the

light? A glorious canopy of golden  
streams ? Lamps of celestial ether  
burning bright ? Suns lighting systems  
with their golden beams ? But Thou to  
these art as the noon to night! VI. Yes!  
as a drop of water in the sea, All this  
magnificence in Thee is lost, What are  
ten thousand worlds compared with Thee ?  
And what am I, then ? Heaven&#x27;s  
unnumbered host, though multiplied by  
myriads, And arrayed in all the glory of  
sublimist thought, Is but an atom in the  
balance weighed against Thy greatness—  
But a cypher brought against infinity.  
What am I, then ? Naught! VII. Naught  
but the effluence of thy light divine  
(Pervading worlds) has reached my bosom  
too; In my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Naught I but I live and on hope&#x27;s  
pinions fly Eager towards Thy presence ;  
For in Thee I live and breathe and  
dwell, Aspiring high, even to the throne

## [DERZHAVEN'S "ODE TO GOD."](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/89686608)

#### From _The Bacchus Marsh Express (Vic. : 1866 - 1918)_

#### 1880-08-07 &middot; [Bacchus Marsh, Victoria](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchus_Marsh)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

DERZHAVEN&#x27;S &quot;ODE TO GOD.&quot; The author of  
this ode was a Russian, born in 1763.  
After serving some time in the army, he  
was made successively Councillor of  
State, Ambassador of Senate, President  
&#x27;of the College of Commerce, and in 1802  
Minister of Justice. The poem has been  
translated into Japanese by order of the  
Emperor, and is hung up, embroidered  
with gold, in the temple of Jeddo. It  
bas also been translated into the  
Chinese and Tartar languages, written oh  
a piece of rich silk, and suspended in  
the Imperial Palace at Pekin. On Thou  
Eternal One! whose presence bright All  
space doth occupy-all motion guide;  
Unchanged through Time&#x27;s all devastating  
flight, Thou only God! There is no God  
beside. Being above all beings! Mighty  
One! Whom none can comprehend, and none  
explore; Who fill&#x27;st existence with  
Thyself alone; Embracing all-supporting,  
ruling o&#x27;erBeing whom we call God, and  
know no more! In its sublime research,  
Philosophy May measure out the ocean  
deep-may count The sands, or the sun&#x27;s  
rays; but God ! for Thee There is no  
weight nor measure; none can mount Up to  
Thy mysteries. Reason&#x27;s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain  
would try To trace Thy counsels,  
infinite and dark; But thought is lost  
ere thought can soar so high, Even like  
past moments of Eternity. Thos from  
primeval nothingness didst call First  
chaos, then existence. Lord, on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation; all Sprung  
forth from Thee; of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin-all life, all beauty Thine.  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
Thy splendour fills all space with rays  
divine; Thou art, and wert, and shall  
be, glorious, great, Light-giving, life-  
sustaining Potentate. Thy chains the  
unmeasured universe surround; Upheld by  
Thee, by Thee inspired with breath! Thou  
the beginning with the end hath bound,  
And beautifully mingled Life and Death!  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery  
blaze, So suns are born, so worlds  
sprang forth from Thee! And as the  
spangles in the sunny rays Shine round  
the silver snow, the pageantry Of  
heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in Thy  
praise. A million torches lighted by Thy  
hand, Wander unwearied through the blue  
abyss; They own Thy power, accomplish  
Thy command; All gay with light, all  
eloquent with bliss. What shall we call  
them P Piles of crystal light ? A  
glorious company of golden streams ?  
Lamps of celestial ether, burning bright  
? Suns lighting systems with their  
joyous beams? But Thou to these art as  
the moon to night. Yes, as a drop of  
water in the sea, All this magnificence  
in Thee is lost; What are ten thousand  
worlds compared to Thee ? And what am I  
then? Heaven&#x27;s unnumbered host, Though  
multiplied by myriads and arrayed In all  
the glory of sublimest thought, Is but  
an atom in the balance, weighed Against  
Thy greatness-is a cipher brought  
Against infinity ! What aui I, then ?  
Naught. Naught! But the effiluence of  
Thy light divine, Pervading worlds, hath  
reached my bosom, too; Yes, in my  
spirit, doth thy Spirit shine, As shines  
the sunbeam in a drop of dew. Naught!  
But I live, and on Hope&#x27;s pinions fly  
Eager toward Thy presence; for in Thee I  
live and breathe and dwell; aspiring  
high, E&#x27;en to the Throne of Thy  
divinity! I am, O God, and surely Thou  
must be! Thou art; directing, guiding  
all, Thou art ! Direct my understanding,  
then, to Thee; Control my spirit, guide  
my wandering heart; Though but an atom  
&#x27;midst immensity, Still, I am something  
fashioned by Thy hand; I hold a middle  
rank, &#x27;twixt Heaven and Earth. On the  
last verge of mortal being stand Close  
to the realms where angels have their  
birth, Just one of the boundaries of the  
Spirit land! The chain of being is  
complete in me; In me is matter&#x27;s last  
gradation lost, And the next step is  
Spirit-Deity ! I can command the  
lightning, and am dust; A monarch and a  
slave; a worm, a god; Whence came 1  
here, and how ? So marvellously  
Constructed and conceived-unknown. This  
clod Lives surely through some higher  
energy; For from itself alone it could  
not be. Creator! Yes! Thy wisdom and Thy  
word Created me! Thou source of life and  
good; T&#x27;hou Spirit of my spirit, and my  
Lord; Thy light, Thy love, in Thy bright  
plenitude Filled me with an immortal  
soul to spring Over the abyss of Death,  
and bade it wear The garments of eternal  
day, and wing Its heavenly flight beyond  
this little sphere E&#x27;en to its source-to  
Thee, its Author-there. O thought

A million torches lighted by thy hand,

Direct my understanding, then, to thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart.  
Though but an atom ’midst immensity,  
Still I am something, fashioned by the hand!  
I hold a middle rank, ’twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realm where angels have their

Constructed and conceived? unknown  
this clod  
Lives surely through some higher en­  
ergy  
For from itself alone It could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy  
word  
Created me! Thou source of life ano  
good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright  
plentitude  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to  
spring  
Over the abyss of death and bade it  
wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little  
sphere,  
EVen to Its source—to Thee—Its authoi  
there.  
O, thoughts ineffable! O, visions blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions ah  
of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill oux  
breast,  
And waft its homage to Thy deity.  
God! Thus alone my lonely thoughts  
can soar,  
Thus seek Thy presence—being wise  
and good!  
  
Midst Thy vast works admire, obey,  
adore.  
And when the tongue is eloquent no  
more  
The soul shall speak in tears of grati­  
tude
