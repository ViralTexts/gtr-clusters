The following poem, translated from the Russian of Derzhavin, is scarcely equalled in grandeur and sublimity by any poem in any language. We take it from a work entitled &#x27;Specimens of the Russian Poets,&#x27; translated by John Bowring.—*Conn. Ob.*  
  
O thou eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide;  
Unchanged thro&#x27; time&#x27;s all devastating flight.  
Thou only God! There is no God beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
Who none can comprehend and none explore;  
Who fill&#x27;st existence with *Thyself* alone:  
Embracing all,—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more.  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean—deep—may count  
The sands of the sun&#x27;s ray—but, God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure:—none can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries; Reason&#x27;s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark:  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high;  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, their existence;—Lord! on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation:—all  
Sprung forth from Thee:—of light, and joy, harmony,  
Sole origin:—all life, all beauty Thine.  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glorious! Great  
Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate!  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround:  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss:  
They own Thy power, accomplish thy command;  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
What shall we call them! Piles of crystal light—  
A glorious company of golden streams—  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright—  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams?  
But Thou to these art as the noon to night.  
  
Yes! As a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost:  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what am I then? Heavens unnumbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance weighed  
Against thy greatness, is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am I then? Nought!  
  
Nought! But the effluence of thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reach&#x27;d my bosom too;  
Yes! in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine  
As shines the sun-beam in a drop of dew.  
Now but I live, and one hope&#x27;s pinions fly  
Eager towards thy presence; for in Thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high.  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity  
I am, O God! and surely *Thou* must be!  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, Thou art!  
Direct my understanding then to Thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart:  
Though but an atom &#x27;midst immensity,  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!  
I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land!  
  
The chain of the being is complete in me;  
In me is matter&#x27;s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is spirit—Deity!  
I can command the lightening, and I am dust!  
A monarch, and a slave; a worm, a God!  
Whence came I here and how? so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown! this clod  
Lives surely through some energy;  
For from itself alone it could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy word  
Created *me!* Thou source of life and good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plenitude,  
Filled me with an immortal soul to spring  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its source—to—Thee—it&#x27;s Author there.  
  
O thoughts ineffable! O visions blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And waft its homage to Thy Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
Thus seek Thy presence—Being wise and good!  
Midst Thy vast works admire, obey, adore;  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

Yes! as a drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in Thee is lost ;—  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?  
And what am J then? Heaven’s unnumber’d host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and urrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,

Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear

Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
  
Even to its source—to thee—it’s author there.  
  
O, thought ineffable! O, visions blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions all of thee,  
Yet shali thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And waft its homage to thy Deity.  
God! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
Thus seek thy presence—Being, wise and good!  
‘Midst thy vast works, admire, obey, adore;  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high;  
Even like past momenU in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, then existence;—Lord I on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation;—all  
Sprung forth from Thee;—of light, joy, harmony,  
^le origin:—all life, all Insauty Thine.  
  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
  
Thy splendor fills all space w ith rays divine.  
  
Thou art, and wert, and shall be! Glorious! Great  
Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate!  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround:  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!  
Thon the beginning with the end hast bound.  
  
And beautifully mingled life and death t  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze.  
  
So BUDS arc born, so worlds spring forth from Thee,  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver enow, the pageantry  
Of heaven’s bright army glitters in Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss:  
  
They own Thy power, accomplish thy command;  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
  
What shall we call them! Piles of crystal light—  
  
A glorious company of golden streams—  
  
Lamps of celestial either burning bright—  
  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous teams ?  
  
But Thou to these art as the noon to night.  
  
Yes! as a drop of water in the sea.  
  
All this magnificence in thee is lost;  
  
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee 1  
And what am 1 then! Heavens unnumbered host.  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought.  
  
Is but an atom in the tiaiance weighed  
Against thy greatness, is a cypher brought  
Against infinity! What am I then ^ Nought!  
  
Nought! But the effluence of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reach’d my bosom too ;  
  
Yes! in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine  
As shines the sun-team in a drop of dew.  
  
Now but 1 live, and on hope’s pinions fiy  
Eager towards thy presence ; for in Thee  
1 live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high.  
  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity  
I am, O God! and surely Thou must be!  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all. Thou art!  
  
Direct my understanding then to Thee ;  
  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart:  
Though but an atom ’midst immensity.  
  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!  
  
I hold a middle rank ’twixt heaven and earth,  
  
On the last verge of mortal being stand.  
  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth.  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land!  
  
The chain of being is complete in me;  
  
In me is mailer’s last gradation lost,  
  
And the next step is spirit—Deity I  
1 command the lightening, and am dust!  
  
A monarch, and a slave; a worm, a God!  
Whence came I here and how 1 so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived! unknown! this clod  
Lives surely through some energy;  
  
For from itself alone it could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy word  
Created me! Thou source of life and good !  
  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lerd!  
  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plenitude.  
Filled me with an immortal soul to spring  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
* Its heavenly flight beyond this 1 ittle sphere.  
  
Even to its source— to.Thec—its Author there.  
  
O thoughU ineffable ! O visions blest!  
  
Though worthies-^our conceptions all of Thee,  
Yet shall thy sliadowcd image fill our breast,  
  
And waft its homage to Thy Deity.  
  
God ! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar ;  
Thus seek Thy presence—Being wise and good!  
Midst Thy vast works admire, obey, adore;  
  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

O, Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright,  
All space doth occupy—all motion guide :  
Unchanged through time’s all-everlasting flight,  
Thou only God: there is no God beside.  
Being above all beings ! Mighty one !  
Who none can comprehend, and none explore ;  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more!  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
The sands, or the sun’s rays—but God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure ; none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries ; reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by thy light, in vain would try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark ;  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness did call  
First, chaos, then existence—Lord, on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation ; ‘all  
Sprung forth from Thee ; all light, joy, harmony,  
Sole Origin—all life, all beauty, thine,  
Thy word created all, and doth create:  
Thy splendor fills all space with raps divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! glorious! great!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining, potentate !  
  
Thy chains the unmeasure universe surround ;  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
As sparks mount upwards from the flery blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee,  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays,  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of Heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by thy hand  
Wander, unwearied, through the blue abyss ;  
  
They ownthy power, accomplish thy command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light ?  
A glorious company of golden streams ?

Nought—but the effluence of thy light divine,

Yes, in my spirit doth Thy Spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.

[From Bowring’s Russian Anthology).  
O thou eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, al) motion guide ;  
Unchanged through time’s all-devastating flight ;  
Thou only God! There is no God beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One!  
Whom none can comprehend and none explore ;  
Who fill’st existence with Thyse/f alone ;  
Embracing all ,—supporting,—ruling o’er,—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more!  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean-deep—may count  
The sands or tne sun’s rays—but, God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure :—none can mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by thy light, in vain would try  
‘To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark :  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
‘Thou from orimeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, then existence ;—Lord! on thee  
Eternity had its foundation :—all  
Sprung forth from thee :—of light, joy, harmony,  
Sote origin : all life, aM beauty thine.  
Thy word created all, and doth create ;  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glorious! Creat!  
Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate !  
Thy chains the d uni 3  
Upheld by thee, by thee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
And beautifully mingled life ané death!  
As sparks mount upwards from the fiery biaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from thee ;  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of heaven’s bright army glitters in thy praise.  
A million torches lighted by the band  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss:  
  
They own thy power, accomplish thy command,  
  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
  
What shall we cali them? Piles of crystal light—  
  
A glorious company of golden streams—  
  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright—  
  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams ?  
  
But thou to these art as the noon to night.  
  
Yes! as a drop of water in the sea,  
  
AH this magnificence in thee is Jost :—  
  
What are ten th d worlds d to thee?  
  
And what am /then? Heaven’s unnumbered host,  
  
Though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed  
  
In all the glory of subtimest thought,  
  
Is but an atom in the balance, weighed  
  
Against thy greatness, is a cipher brought  
Against infinity! O, whatamIthen? Nonght!  
  
Nonught! yet the effluence of thy light divine,  
  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too ;  
  
Yes! in my spirit doth thy spirit shine,  
  
As shines the sun-beam in a drop of dew.  
  
Nought! yet live, and ou hopé’s pinions fly  
  
Eager towards thy presence ; for in thee  
  
T live, and breathe, and dwell ; aspiring high,  
  
Even to the throne of thy divinity.  
  
Tam, © God! and surely thou must bet  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding ail, thou art?  
  
Direct my understanding, then, to thee ;  
  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart :  
  
‘Though but an atom midst immensity,  
  
Still T am something, fashioned by thy hand !  
  
T hold a middle rank *twixt heaven and earth,  
  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit-land!  
  
The chain of being is complete in me;  
  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost,  
  
And the next step is spirit—Deity !  
  
I can command the lightning, and am dust’!  
  
A menarch, and a slave ; a worm, a god!  
  
Whence came I here? and how so marvellously  
  
Constructed and conceived? unknown! this cled  
  
Lives surely through some higher energy ;  
  
For from ‘itself atone it cowid not be!  
  
Creator, yes! thy wisdom and thy word  
  
Created me! thou source of life and good?  
  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
  
Thy light, thy love, in their bright plenitude  
  
Filled me with an immortal seul, to spring  
  
Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
  
{ts heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
  
Even to Ks source—to thee—its Author there.  
  
O thoughts ineffatie! O visions blest!  
  
Though worthless our conceptions all of thee,  
  
Yet shall thy shadowed image fill eur breast,  
  
And waft.its homage to thy Deity.  
  
God! thus alone my lonely thoughts can soar ;  
  
‘Thus seek thy presence, Being wise and good!  
  
Midst thy vast works admire, obey, adore ;  
  
And, when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide ;  
Unchanged through Time’s all-devastating flight,  
Though only God! There is no God beside !  
Being above all beings! mighty one!  
  
Whom none can comprehend and none explore,  
Who fill’st existence with Thyself alone—  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o’er—  
Being whom we call God—and know no more!  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
  
May measure out the ocean deep—may count  
  
The sands or the sun’s rays—but God! for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure—none can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries ; Reason’s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain may try  
  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark:  
  
And thought is lost e’er thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
  
First, chaos—then existence—Lord, on Thee  
Eternity had its foundation—all  
  
Sprang forth from Thee—of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin—all life, all beauty Thine.  
  
Thy word created all, and doth create ;  
  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine.  
  
Thou art, and wert, and shall be! Glorious! Great!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining Potentate !  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured Universe surround—  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath !  
Thou the beginning with the end hast hound,  
  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,  
  
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee ;.

_ A- million torches lighted by Thy hand,  
  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss ;

All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.

A glorious company of golden streams ?

But Thou to these are as the noon to night!

Naught !—But the effluence of Thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, has reached my bosom too ;  
Yes, in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
  
As shines the sunbeam ip a drop of dew.  
Naught!—But I live, and on Hope’s pinions fly

Even to the throne of thy divinity :  
  
I am, O God! and surely Thou must be !  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all: Thou art!  
Direct my understanding, then, to Thee:  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart ;  
Though but an atom ’mid immensity,  
Still I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!

On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
Just on the boundary of the spirit land !  
  
e  
  
The chain of being is complete in me;  
  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost,  
  
And the next step is spirit—Deity !  
  
I can command the lightning, and am dust!  
  
  
  
PARAGRAPHS FROM THE PAPERS.  
  
A monarch and a slave—a worm, a god!  
  
Whence came I here? and how so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown! This clod  
Lives surely through some higher energy,  
  
For from itself alone it could not be.  
  
Creator! Yes, Thy wisdom and Thy word  
Created me! Thou source of life and good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright plentitude  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to spring  
Over the abyss of Death, and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its souree—to Thee—its author there.  
  
O thought ineffable! O vision blest !  
  
Though worthless our conceptions all of Thee ;  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast,  
And with it homage to the Deity.  
  
God! thus above my lowly thoughts can soar ;  
Thus seek Thy presence—Being wise and good ;  
’Mid Thy vast works, admire, obey, adore ;  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
  
The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

gratifying to learn that these nations have done  
themselves the honor to bestow such praise on  
this noble composition.]  
O Thou Eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy, all motion guide;  
Unchanged through Time&#x27;s all devastating flight,  
Thou ony God! There is no God beside.  
Being above all beings! Mighty one!  
Whom none can comprehend, and none ex­  
plore ;  
Who fill&#x27;st existence with thyself alone :  
Embracing all—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er—  
Being whom we cal! God—and know no more!  
In its sublime research, Philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep; may count  
The sands or the sun&#x27;s rays; but. God, for thee  
There is no v eight nor measure; none can  
mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason&#x27;s brightest spark,  
Though kindled by the light in vain would try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite the dark.  
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
E&#x27;en like past moments in eternity.  
Thou, from primeval nothingness, didst call  
First t haos. then Existence. Lord, on thee  
Eternity had its foundation; all  
Spring forth from toee; of Light, Joy, Harmo­  
ny

Thy word created all and doth create;  
Thy splendor fii&#x27;s all space with rays divine;  
Tijou art. aud wert, and shall be, glorious!  
great!  
Life-givin_, &#x27;ile-sustaining Potentate!  
Thy charms the unqjeasured universe surround.  
Upheld bi thee by thee inspired with breath!  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
Ami beautiful y mingled Life and Death!  
As sparks moi nt upward from the fiery blaze,  
So suns bOl _, so worlds spring forth from  
  
Thee!  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round tbe silver SHOW, the pageantry  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in thy praise.  
A million torciioi lighted by thy hand,  
Wander unwear ed through the blueabyss;  
They own th power, accomplish thy command,  
All gay with ii!&quot;, all eloquent with biiss,

Yea ; as a drop of water in the sea,  
All this io&lt; nitieenee in tnee is lost.  
What are a thousand worlds compared to thee?  
And what am I wh n heaven&#x27;s unnumbered

In ail the g&#x27;on of sublimest thought.

Even to the t &gt;rone of the divinity I  
1 am, O 00-i! a:.d surely thou must be.  
Thou art! directing guiding all, thou art,  
Direct my understanding, then, to thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart.  
Though but an :.tom &#x27;midst immentity,  
Still I am samothing fashioned by thy hand,  
I hold a middle rank, &#x27;twixt heaven and earth,  
On the la.-t verge of mortal being stand;  
Close to t!ie;rea m where angels have their birth,  
Just on the boundary ofthe spirit hand.  
The chain of being is complete in me ;  
In me .s matter s ast gradation lost,  
And thenex step is spirit -Deity!  
I can commind the lightning, and am dust;  
A monarch, and a slave; a worm, a god.  
W hencj came i here, and how? so marvellous­

From out itself alone it could not be.  
Creator! Yes I thywisdom and thy word  
Cre ted me. Thou soarceof life and good !  
Thou spirit ol my spirit, and my Lord I  
Thy light thy love, in their bright plenitude,  
Filled mo with an immortal soul to spring  
Over tiie abyss of deith and bade it wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
Even to its source—to thee, its Author, thee.  
Oh thought ineffable ! Oh vision blest!  
(Though worthless our conceptions all of thee);  
Yet shall thy shadowed image liil our breast,  
And wait its homage to the Diety.  
God ! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
Thus seek thy presence. Being wise and good,  
&#x27;Midst thy vast works, admire, obey, adore;  
And when the tongue is eloquent no more,  
The soul shall spes.k in tears of gratitude.

Unchanged through time&#x27;s all devastating  
flight, Thou only God !—there is no God  
beside. Being above all beings—Mighty  
one, Whom none can comprehend and none  
explore, Who fill&#x27;st existence with  
Thyself alone ; Embracing  
all—supporting—ruling o&#x27;er, Being whom  
we call God, and know no more. II In its  
sublime research—philosophy May measure  
out the ocean deep, May count the sound  
and the sun&#x27;s rays ; But God ! for thee  
there is no weight nor measure; None can  
mount up to Thy mysteries. Reason&#x27;s  
brightest spark though kindled by thy  
light, In vain would try to trace Thy  
counsels infinite and dark, And thought  
is lost ere thought can soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity, III.  
Thou from primeval nothingness did&#x27;st  
call first chaos, then existence, Lord !  
on Thee eternity had its foundation ;  
All spring forth from Thee, of light,  
joy, gladness, All life—all beauty  
Thine. Thy word created and doth create,  
Thy splendour fills all space with rays  
divine, Thou art—and wert—and shalt be  
Glorious! Great! Lifegiving—life-  
sustaining potentate. IV. Thy chains the  
unmeasured universe surround, Upheld by  
Thee, by Thee inspired with breath ;  
Thou the beginning with the end hast  
bound, And beautifully mingled life and  
death. As sparks mount upwards from the  
fiery blaze, So suns are born and worlds  
spring forth from Thee; &amp;nbsp; And as  
the spangles in the sunny rays Shine  
round the silver snow, the pageantry Of  
Heaven&#x27;s bright array glitters it Thy  
praise. V. A million torches lighted by  
Thy hand, Wander unwearied through the  
blue abyss, They own Thy power,  
accomplish Thy commands, All gay with  
life, All eloquent with bliss ; What  
shall we call them—piles of chrystal  
light? A glorious canopy of golden  
streams ? Lamps of celestial ether  
burning bright ? Suns lighting systems  
with their golden beams ? But Thou to  
these art as the noon to night! VI. Yes!  
as a drop of water in the sea, All this  
magnificence in Thee is lost, What are  
ten thousand worlds compared with Thee ?  
And what am I, then ? Heaven&#x27;s  
unnumbered host, though multiplied by  
myriads, And arrayed in all the glory of  
sublimist thought, Is but an atom in the  
balance weighed against Thy greatness—  
But a cypher brought against infinity.  
What am I, then ? Naught! VII. Naught  
but the effluence of thy light divine  
(Pervading worlds) has reached my bosom  
too; In my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Naught I but I live and on hope&#x27;s

For in Thee I live and breathe and  
dwell, Aspiring high, even to the throne  
of thy mag-nificence. I am, 0 God!—then

Direct my understanding then to Thee,  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering

fashioned by thy hand. I hold a middle  
rank twixt heaven and earth; On the last  
verge of mortal being stand, Close to  
the realms where angels have their  
birth, Just on the bound&#x27;ry of the  
spirit land. IX. The chain of being is  
complete in me, In me is matter&#x27;s last  
gradation lost, And the next step is  
spirit !—deity ! I can command the  
lightning, yet am dust; A monarch and a  
slave—a god—a worm— Whence came I here ?  
and how ? So marvellously constructed  
and conceived. This clod lives surely  
through some higher energy, For out

my God! &amp;nbsp; Thy life ! Thy love ! in  
their bright plenitude, Fill me with  
immortal soul to spring Over the abyss  
of death and bade it wear The garments

ineffable ! O vision blest ! Though  
worthless our conception all of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill our

GOD.  
  
O thou Eternal One! whose presence bright  
All space doth occupy,—all motion guide ;  
Unchanged through time’s all devastating flight, |  
Thou only God! there is no God beside,  
Being above all beings, mighty one!  
Whom none can comprehend and none explore  
Who fill’st existence with thyself alone,  
Embracing all, supporting, ruling o&#x27;er!  
Being whom we call God, and know no more!  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean deep,—may count  
The sands, or the sun’s rays,—but God! for thee  
There is no weight nor measure. None can  
mount  
Up to thy mysteries. Reason’s bright spark,  
Though kindled by thy light, in vain would try  
To trace thy counsels, infinite and dark ;  
And thought is lost e’er thought can soar so  
high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst call  
First chaos, then existence,—Lord, on the  
Eternity had its foundation ; all  
Sprung forth from thee,—of light, joy, har-  
mony,  
Sole origin,—all life, all beauty there ;  
Thy word created all, and doth create;  
Thy splendor fills all space with day divine;  
Thou art, and wast, and shall be, glorious,  
great!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining potentate.  
  
Thy chains, the unmeasured universe surround,  
Upheld by thee,—by thee inspired with breath!  
  
Thou the beginning with the end hath bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
  
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,  
So sons are born, so words spring forth from  
  
thee;  
  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine around the silver snow, the pageantry  
Of Heaven’s bright army glitters in thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by thy hand,  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss;  
  
  
  
They own thy power, accomplish thy command.  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss,  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal  
light?  
A glorious company of golden streams?  
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright ?  
Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams?  
But thou to them art as the moon to night.  
  
Yes as the drop of water in the sea,  
All this magnificence in thee is lost;  
What are ten thousand worlds compared with  
thee ?  
And whatam I, then? Heaven’s unnumbered  
host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and array’d  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance weighed,  
Against thy greatness,—is a cypher brought  
Against infinity. WhatamI then? Nought  
  
Nought !—but the effluence of thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too,  
Yes; in my spirit doth thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeams in a drop of dew,  
Nought! but I live, and on Hope’s pinions fly,  
Eager toward thy presence ? .for in thee  
I live, and breathe, and dwell, aspiring high;  
  
  
  
E’en to the throne of thy divinity,  
T am, O God, and surely thou must be!

Direct my understanding, then, to thee;  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart.  
  
Though but an atom ’midst immensity,  
Still Iam something, fashioned by the hand!  
  
I hold a middle rank, ’twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
  
Close to the realm where angels have their  
  
birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit land.

First chaos, then existence. Lord, on thee  
  
Eternity had its foundation: all  
  
Sprung forth from thee; of light, joy, harmony,  
Sole origin: all life, all beauty thine.  
  
Thy word created all, and doth create ;  
  
Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine,  
  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glorious! Great !  
Life-giving, life-sustaining Potentate !  
  
Thy claims the unmeasur’d universe surround :  
Upheld by thee, by thee inspir’d with breath :  
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,  
  
And beautifully mingled life and death !  
  
As sparks mount upwards from the fiery blaze,  
  
So suns are born ; so worlds spring forth from thee;  
And, as the spangles in the sunny rays  
  
Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry  
  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army, glitters in thy praise.  
  
A million torches, lighted by thy hand,  
  
Wander unwearied through the blue abyss :  
  
They own thy power, accomplish thy command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.  
  
What shall we call them? Piles of crystal light;  
A glorious company of golden streams,  
  
Lamps of celestial ether, burning bright—  
  
Suns, lighting systems with their joyous beams ?  
But thou to these art as the moon to-night.  
  
Yes, as a drop of water in the sea,  
  
All this magnificence in thee is lost ;  
  
What are ten thousand worlds compar&#x27;d to thee ?  
And what am I then? Heaven’s unnumber’d host,  
Though multiplied by myriads, and array’d  
  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
  
Is but an atom in the balance, weigh’d  
  
Against thy greatness—is a cypher brought  
  
Against infinity! What amIthen? Nought!  
  
Nought! But the influence of thy light divine,  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom, too;  
Yes! in my spirit doth thy spirit shine,  
  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.  
Nought! but I live, and on hope’s pinions fly  
Eager towards thy presence; for in thee  
  
I live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high,  
E’en to the throne of thy divinity.  
  
I am, O God! and surely thou must be!  
  
Thou art! directing, guiding all, thou art!  
  
Direct my understanding, then, to thee ;  
  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering heart :  
Though but an atom midst immensity,  
  
Still I am something fashion’d by thy hand !  
  
I hold a middle rank ’twixt heaven and earth,  
On the last verge of mortal being stand,  
  
Close to the realms where angels have their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit-land !  
  
The chain of being is complete in me,—  
  
In me is matter’s last gradation lost ;  
  
And the next step is spirit— Deity !  
  
I can command the lightning, and am dust!  
  
A monarch, and a slave; a worm, a God!  
Whence came I here? and how so marvellously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown. This clod  
  
  
  
F RLEN

Lives surely cle some higher energy ;  
For, from itself alone, it could not be  
  
Creator, yes! thy wisdom, and thy word  
  
Created me! Thou source of life and good !  
  
hou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!  
  
hy light, thy love, in their bright plenitude,  
  
Fill’d me with an immortal soul to spring  
  
O’er the abyss of death, and bade it wear  
  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,  
  
E’en to its source—to thee—its Author there  
  
O thought ineffable! 0 visions blest!  
  
Though worthless, our conceptions all of thee ;  
  
Yet shall thy shadow’d image fill our breast,  
  
And waft its homage to thy Deity.  
  
God, thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar;  
  
Thus seek thy presence, Being wise and good !  
  
Midst thy vast works admire, obey, adore ;  
  
And, when the tongue is eloquent no more,

It is a poem of many stanzas, familiar to our parents,

ccupy, all motion guide  
Unchanged through time&#x27;s all-devastat­  
ing flight!  
Thou only God—there Is no god beside!  
Being above all beings! Mighty One,  
Whom none can comprehend and none  
explore!  
Who flll&#x27;st existence with thyself alone,  
Embracing all, supporting, ruling o&#x27;er—  
Being whom we call God, and know no  
more.  
  
In its sublime research, philosophy  
May measure out the ocean-deep—may  
count  
The sands or the sun&#x27;s rays—but, God!  
for Thee  
There is no weight nor measure none  
can mount  
Up to Thy mysteries Reason&#x27;s bright­  
est spark,  
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain  
would try  
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and  
dark  
And thought is lost ere thought can  
soar so high,  
Even like past moments in eternity.  
  
Thou from primeval nothingness didst  
oall  
First chaos, then existence—Lord! in  
  
Thee  
  
Eternity had its foundations all  
Sprung forth from Thee—of light, joy,  
harmony,  
Sole Origin—all life, all beauty Thine,  
Thy word created&quot;all and doth create  
Thy splendor Alls all space with rays  
divine  
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be, Glo­  
rious! Great!  
Life-giving, life-sustaining potentate!  
  
Thy chains the unmeasured universe  
surround—  
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with  
breath  
Thou the beginning with the end hast  
bound,  
And beautifully mingled life and death!  
As sparks mount upward from the  
fiery blaze,  
So suns are born, so worlds soring  
forth from Thee  
And as the spangles in the sunny rays  
Shine round the silver snow, the pa­  
geantry  
Of heaven&#x27;s bright army glitters in  
  
Thy praise.  
  
A million torches lighted by Thy hand  
Wander unwearied through the blue  
abyss—  
They own Thy power, accomplish Thy  
command,  
All gay with life, all eloquent with  
bliss.  
What shall we call them? Piles of  
crystal light—  
A glorious company of golden streams,  
Lamps of celestial ether burning  
bright—  
Suns lighting systems with their joy­  
ous beams?  
  
But Thou to these are as the noon to  
light,  
Yes, as a drop of water In the sea,  
All this magnificence In The is lost—  
What are ten thousand worlds compar­  
ed to Thee?  
And what am I, then?—Heaven&#x27;s un­  
numbered host,  
Though multiplied by myriads and ar­  
rayed  
In all the glory of sublimest thought,  
Is but an atom in the balance, weighed  
Agoinst thy greatness, is a cipher  
brought  
Against Infinity! What am I, then?  
  
Naught.  
  
Naught! But the effluence of Thy light  
divine.  
Pervading worlds, hath reached my  
bosom, too  
Yes In my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,  
As shines the sunbeam in a drop of  
dew.  
Naught! but I live, and on hope&#x27;s pin­  
ions fly  
Eager toward Thy presence—for in  
  
Thee  
  
1 live and breathe, and dwell aspiring  
high,  
Even to the throne of Thy divinity.  
I am, O God, and surely Thou must be!  
  
Thou art Idirecting, guiding all—Thou  
art!  
Direct my understanding then to Thee  
Control my spirit, guide my wandering  
heart  
Though but an atom &#x27;midst immensity,  
Still I am something fashioned by Thy  
hand!  
I hold a middle rank &#x27;twixt heaven  
and earth—  
On the last verge of mortal being stand  
Close to the realms where angels have  
their birth,  
Just on the boundaries of the spirit  
land!  
  
The chain of being is complete in me—  
In me is matter&#x27;s last gradation lost,  
And the next step is spirit—deity!  
I can command the lightning, and am  
dust!  
A monarch and a slave—a worm, a god!  
Whence came I here, and how? so  
marvelously  
Constructed and conceived? unknown  
this clod  
Lives surely through some higher en­  
ergy  
For from itself alone It could not be!  
  
Creator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy  
word  
Created me! Thou source of life ano  
good!  
Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord  
Thy light, Thy love, in their bright  
plentitude  
Filled me with an immortal soul, to  
spring  
Over the abyss of death and bade it  
wear  
The garments of eternal day, and wing  
Its heavenly flight beyond this little  
sphere,  
EVen to Its source—to Thee—Its authoi  
there.  
O, thoughts ineffable! O, visions blest!  
Though worthless our conceptions ah  
of Thee,  
Yet shall Thy shadowed image fill oux  
breast,  
And waft its homage to Thy deity.  
God! Thus alone my lonely thoughts  
can soar,  
Thus seek Thy presence—being wise  
and good!  
  
Midst Thy vast works admire, obey,  
adore.  
And when the tongue is eloquent no  
more  
The soul shall speak in tears of grati­  
tude
