Courteous Reader,  
Astrology is one of the most ancient Sciences, had in high Esteem of old, by the Wise and Great. Formerly, no Prince would make War or Peace, nor any General fight a Battle, in short, no important Affair was undertaken without first consulting an Astrologer, who examined the Aspects and Configurations of the heavenly Bodies, and mark’d the lucky Hour. Now the noble Art (more Shame to the Age we live in!) is dwindled into Contempt; the Great neglect us, Empires make Leagues, and Parliaments Laws, without advising with us; and scarce any other Use is made of our learned Labours, than to find the best Time of cutting Corns, or gelding Pigs. This Mischief we owe in a great Measure to ourselves: The Ignorant Herd of Mankind, had they not been encourag’d to it by some of us, would never have dared to depreciate our sacred Dictates; but Urania has been betray’d by her own Sons; those whom she had favour’d with the greatest Skill in her divine Art, the most eminent Astronomers among the Moderns, the Newtons, Halleys, and Whistons, have wantonly contemn’d and abus’d her, contrary to the Light of their own Consciences. Of these, only the last nam’d, Whiston, has liv’d to repent, and speak his Mind honestly. In his former Works he had treated Judiciary Astrology as a Chimera, and asserted, That not only the fixed Stars, but the Planets (Sun and Moon excepted) were at so immense a Distance, as to be incapable of any Influence on this Earth, and consequently nothing could be foretold from their Positions: but now in the Memoirs of his Life, publish’d 1749, in the 82d Year of his Age, he foretels, Page 607, the sudden Destruction of the Turkish Empire, and of the House of Austria, German Emperors, &amp;c. and Popes of Rome; the Restoration of the Jews, and Commencement of the Millennium; all by the Year 1766; and this not only from Scripture Prophecies; but (take his own Words) “From the remarkable astronomical Signals that are to alarm Mankind of what is coming, viz. The Northern Lights since 1715; the six Comets at the Protestant Reformation in four Years, 1530, 1531, 1533, 1534, compar’d with the seven Comets already seen in these last eleven Years 1737, 1739, 1742, 1743, 1744, 1746, and 1748. From the great Annular Eclipse of the Sun, July 14, 1748, whose Center pass’d through all the four Monarchies, from Scotland to the East-Indies. From the Occultation of the Pleiades by the Moon each periodical Month, after the Eclipse last July, for above three Years, visible to the whole Roman Empire; as there was a like Occultation of the Hyades from A. 590, to A. 595, for six Years foretold by Isaiah. From the Transit of Mercury over the Sun, April 25, 1753, which will be visible thro’ that Empire. From the Comet of A.D. 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682, which will appear again about 1757 ending, or 1758 beginning, and will also be visible thro’ that Empire. From the Transit of Venus over the Sun, May 26, 1761, which will be visible over the same Empire: And lastly, from the annular Eclipse of the Sun, March 11, 1764, which will be visible over the same Empire.” From these Astronomical Signs, he foretels those great Events, That within 16 Years from this Time, “the Millennium or 1000 Years Reign of Christ shall begin, there shall be a new Heavens, and a new Earth; there shall be no more an Infidel in Christendom, Page 398, nor a Gaming-Table at Tunbridge!” When these Predictions are accomplished, what glorious Proofs they will be of the Truth of our Art? And if they happen to fail, there is no doubt but so profound an Astronomer as Mr. Whiston, will be able to see other Signs in the Heavens, foreshowing that the Conversion of Infidels was to be postponed, and the Millennium adjourn’d. After these great Things can any Man doubt our being capable of predicting a little Rain or Sun-shine? Reader, Farewell, and make the best Use of your Years and your Almanacks, for you see, that according to Whiston, you may have at most, but sixteen more of them.  
R. Saunders  
Patowmack, July 30, 1750.

ov’d his Ruin. When at the Alehouse among his idle Companions, if one remark’d that the Clock struck Eleven, What is that, says he, among us all? If she sent him Word by the Boy, that it had struck Twelve; Tell her to be easy, it can never be more. If, that it had struck One, Bid her be comforted, for it can never be less.  
If we lose our Money, it gives us some Concern. If we are cheated or robb’d of it, we are angry: But Money lost may be found; what we are robb’d of may be restored: The Treasure of Time once lost, can never be recovered; yet we squander it as tho’ ’twere nothing worth, or we had no Use for it.  
  
The Bell strikes One: We take no Note of Time,  
But from its Loss. To give it then a Tongue  
Is wise in Man. If heard aright  
It is the Knell of our departed Hours;  
Where are they? With the Years beyond the Flood:  
It is the Signal that demands Dispatch;  
How much is to be done? ——  
Be wise To-day, ’tis Madness to defer;  
Next day the fatal Precedent will plead;  
Thus on, till Wisdom is push’d out of Life:  
Procrastination is the Thief of Time,  
Year after Year it steals till all are fled,  
And to the Mercies of a Moment leaves  
The vast Concerns of an eternal Scene.  
If not so frequent, would not this be strange?  
That ’tis so frequent, This is stranger still.

is-spent is worse than what you lose.  
Be fully e’er you speak your Subject known,  
And let e’en then some Diffidence be shown.  
Keep something silent, and we think you wise,  
But when we see the Bottom, we despise.  
  
He that is conscious of a Stink in his Breeches, is jealous of every Wrinkle in another’s Nose.  
Love and Tooth-ach have many Cures, but none infallible, except Possession and Dispossession.  
On the 15th of this Month, Anno Romae 709, Julius Caesar was slain in the Senate-House: He fought! he conquer’d! he triumph’d! For what? For Fame.  
  
And with what rare Inventions do we strive  
Ourselves then to survive.  
Some with vast costly Tombs would purchase it,  
And by the Proofs of Death pretend to live.  
Here lies the Great —— False Marble, where?  
Nothing but small and sordid Dust lies there.  
Some build enormous Mountain Palaces  
The Fools and Architects to please:  
A lasting Life in well hewn Stone they rear.  
  
Caesar an higher Place does claim,  
In the Seraphic Entity of Fame:  
He, since that Toy his Death,  
Does fill all Mouths, and breathes in all Men’s Breath;  
——The two immortal Syllables remain;  
But O ye learned Men explain,  
What Essence, what Existence this  
In six poor Letters is?  
In those alone does the great Caesar live;  
’Tis all the conquer’d World could give,  
We Poets madder yet than all,  
With a refin’d fantastick Vanity  
Think we not only have but give Eternity.  
Fain would I see that Prodigal  
Who his To-morrow would bestow,  
For all old Homer’s Life, e’er since he dy’d till now.

What will not Lux’ry taste? Earth, Sea, and Air,  
Are daily ransack’d for the Bill of Fare.  
Blood stuff’d in Guts is British Christian’s Food,  
And France robs Marshes of the croaking Brood;  
But he had sure a Palate cover’d o’er  
With Brass or Steel, that on the rocky Shore,  
First broke the oozy Oister’s pearly Coat,  
And risk’d the living Morsel down his Throat.  
  
’Tis easier to suppress the first Desire, than to satisfy all that follow it.  
Don’t judge of Mens Wealth or Piety, by their Sunday Appearances.  
Friendship increases by visiting Friends, but by visiting seldom.  
July. V Month.  
  
Vice luring, in the Way of Virtue lies,  
God suffers This; but tempts not; tho’ He tries.  
Go wrong, go right, ’tis your own Action still;  
He leaves you to your Choice, of Good, or Ill.  
Then chuse the Good! the Ill submisly bear!  
The Man of Virtue is above Despair.  
Safe on this Maxim with the Writer rest,  
That all that happens, happens for the best.  
  
If your Riches are yours, why don’t you take them with you to the t’other World?  
What more valuable than Gold? Diamonds. Than Diamonds? Virtue.

August. VI Month.  
  
Ye Party Zealots, thus it fares with you,  
When Party Rage too warmly you pursue;  
  
Both Sides club Nonsense and impetuous Pride,  
And Folly joins whom Sentiments divide.  
You vent your Spleen as Monkeys when they pass,  
Scratch at the mimic Monkey in the Glass,  
While both are one; and henceforth be it known,  
Fools of both Sides shall stand as Fools alone.  
  
If worldly Goods cannot save me from Death, they ought not to hinder me of eternal Life.  
’Tis great Confidence in a Friend to tell him your Faults, greater to tell him his.  
September. VII Month.  
  
Ah! What is Life? With Ills encompass’d round,  
Amidst our Hopes, Fate strikes the sudden Wound;  
To-day the Statesman of new Honour dreams,  
To-morrow Death destroys his airy Schemes.  
Is mouldy Treasure in thy Chest confin’d;  
Think, all that Treasure thou must leave behind;  
Thy Heir with Smiles shall view thy blazon’d Hearse,  
And all thy Hoards, with lavish Hand disperse.  
  
Talking against Religion is unchaining a Tyger; The Beast let loose may worry his Deliverer.  
Ambition often spends foolishly what Avarice had wickedly collected.  
October. VIII Month.  
  
Should certain Fate th’impending Blow delay,  
Thy Mirth will sicken, and thy Bloom decay;  
Then feeble Age will all thy Nerves disarm,  
No more thy Blood its narrow Channels warm;  
Who then would wish to stretch this narrow Span,  
To suffer Life beyond the Date of Man?  
The virtuous Soul pursues a nobler Aim,  
And Life regards but as a fleeting Dream.  
  
Pillgarlic was in the Accusative Case, and bespoke a Lawyer in the Vocative, who could not understand him till he made use of the Dative.

She longs to wake, and wishes to get free,  
To launch from Earth into Eternity.  
For while the boundless Theme extends our Thought,  
Ten thousand thousand rolling Years are nought.  
O endless Thought! divine Eternity!  
Th’immortal Soul shares but a Part of thee;  
For thou wert present when our Life began,  
When the warm Dust shot up in breathing Man.  
  
Not to oversee Workmen, is to leave them your Purse open.  
The Wise and Brave dares own that he was wrong.  
Cunning proceeds from Want of Capacity.  
It is an amusing Speculation to look back, and compute what Numbers of Men and Women among the Ancients, clubb’d their Endeavours to the Production of a single Modern. As you reckon backwards the Number encreases in the same Proportion as the Price of the Coat which was sold for a Half-penny a Button, continually doubled.  
  
Thus, a present Nobleman (for Instance) is

Carry the Reckoning back 300 Years farther, and the Number amounts to above 500 Millions; which are more than exist at any one Time upon Earth, and shews the Impossibility of preserving Blood free from such Mixtures, and that the Pretension of such Purity of Blood in ancient Families is a mere Joke.

ETERNITY.  
  
Ere the foundations of the world were laid,  
  
Ere kindling light th’ Almighty word obeyed,  
  
Thou wert; and, when the subterraneous flame  
Shall burst its prison, and devour this frame.  
  
From angry heaven when the keen lightning flies.  
When fervent heat dissolves the melting skies,  
Thou still Shalt be; still as thou wert before,  
  
And know no change, when time shall be no more.  
O endless thought! divine eternity • ^  
  
Th’ immortal soul shares but a part of thee ;  
  
For thou wert present when our life began.  
  
When the warm dust shot up in breathing man.  
  
Ah &#x27; what is life? with ills encompassed round,  
AraidJt our hopes, fate strikes the sudden wound:  
T(^ay the statesman of new honour dreams.  
To-morrow death destroys his airy schemes.  
  
Is mouldy treasure in thy chest confin’d.  
  
Think all that treasure thou must leave behind;  
Thy heir with smiles shall view thy blazon’d hearse,  
And all thy hoards with lavish hand disperse.  
Should certain fate th’ impending blow delay.  
  
Thy mirth will sicken, and thy bloom decay;  
  
Then feeble age will all thy nerves disarm.  
  
No more thy mood its narrow channels warm.  
  
Who then would wish to stretch this narrow span,  
To suffer life beyond the date of man!  
  
The virtuous soul pursues a nobler aim  
And life regards but as a fleeting dream:  
  
She longs to wake, and wishes to get free.  
  
To launch from earth into eternity.  
  
For, while the boundless theme extends our thought.  
Ton thousand thousand rolling years are naught.

“ Courteous Reader,—Astrology is one of the most  
ancient sciences, held in high esteem of old by the wise  
and great. Formerly no prince would make war or  
peace, nor any general fight a battle ; in short, no im-  
portant affair was undertaken without first consulting  
an Astrologer, who examined the aspects and configu-  
rations of the heavenly bodies, and marked the lucky  
hour. Now the noble art (more shame to the age we  
live in) is dwindled into contempt; the great neglect  
us; empires make leagues and parliament laws with-  
out advising with us ; and scarce any other use is made  
of our learned labors, than to find out the best time of  
cutting corns and gelding pigs. This mischief we owe  
in a great measure to ourselves; the ignorant herd of  
mankind, had they not been encouraged to it by some  
of us, would never have dared to depreciate our sacred  
  
  
  
dictates; but Urania has been betrayed by her own  
sons; those whom she had favored with the greatest  
skill in her divine art, the most eminent Astronemers  
among the moderns, the Mewtons, Halleys aud Whistons,  
have wantonly contemned and abused her contrary to  
the light of their own consciences. Of these, only the  
last named, Whiston, has lived to repent and speak his  
mind honestly. Ip his former works he had treated  
judicial astrology as a chimera, and asserted that not only  
ihe fixed stars, but the planets (sun and moon excepted)  
were at so immense a distance as to be incapable of any  
influence on this earth, and consequently nothing could  
be foretold from their positions ; but now, in the me-  
1749, in the eighty-second  
of his age, he foretells, page 607, the sudden destruction  
of the ‘Turkish Empire and of the House of Austria,  
German Emperors, &amp;c. and Popes of Rome; the Res-  
toration of the Jews and commencement of the Mille.  
nium, all: by the year 1766, and this not only from  
Scriptural prophecies, but (take his own words) “ from  
the remarkable .2stronomical signals that are to alarm  
  
moirs of his life, published  
  
mankind of what is coming, viz. the Northern Liehts  
sinee 1715, the six comets at the Protestant Reforma-  
tion in four years, 1530, 1531, 1533, 1534, compared  
with the seven comets already seen in these last eleven  
years, 1757, 1739, 1742, 1744, 1746, and 1748—from  
the great annular eclipse of the sun July 14, 1748,  
whose centre passed through all the four monarchies  
from Scotland to the Kast Indies—from the occultation  
of the Pleiades by the moon each periodical month after  
the eclipse last July, for above three years visible to  
the whole Roman Empire—from the comet of A.D,  
1456, 1531, 1607 and 1682, which will appear again  
about 1757 ending, or 1758 beginning, and will also be  
visible through that Empire—from the Transit of Venus  
over the Sun May 26, 1761, which will be visible over  
the same Empire: and lastly, from the annular eclipse  
of the sun March 11, 1764, which will be visible over  
the same Empire.” From these Astronomical signs he  
foretold those great events—that within sixteen years  
from this time, ‘*the Millenium or 1000 years reign of  
Christ shall begin; there shall be a new heaven and @  
new earth; there shall be no more an infidel in Chris-  
tendom, nor a gaming table at Tunbridge!” When  
these predictions are accomplished, what glorious proois  
will they be of the truth of our art! And if they happen  
to fail there is no doubt that so profound an Astronomer  
as Mr. Whiston, will be able to see other signs in the  
heavens, foreshowing that the conversion of the infidels  
was to be postponed and the Millenium adjourned.  
After these great things, can any man doubt our heirs  
capable of predicting a little rain or sunshine? Reader,  
farewell, and make the best use of your years and your  
Almanacks, for you see that according to Whiston, you  
may have at most but sixteen more of them.  
R. SAUNDERS,  
  
Patowmack, July 30, 1750.

Walter Scott in one of his novels):  
“ The bell strikes One. We take no note of time  
But from its loss: to give it thena tongue  
Is wise in man. As if an angel spoke,  
I feel the solemn sound. If heard aright,  
It is the knell of my departed hours.”  
There is also merit in the following:—  
* All men think all men mortal! but themselves.”  
** A man of pleasure is a man of pains.”  
“ To feel is to be fir&#x27;d;  
And to believe, Lorenzo, is to feel.”  
  
But these few exhaust the  
elegant extracts worthy to be culled from this once  
favourite poet. It is curious, if Montgomery did  
not have Young in mind, that both poets should  
have thus meandered in their poetic flights.

 a birthday, or  
  
a New Year’s Day, should come and go unnoted by a  
thoughtful person. “Time is the stuff that life is  
made of ;” and time is known to us only through  
its divisions. “Our conception of time originates in  
that of motion ””—of progression. “ Duration, as set  
out? by certain periods, and marked by certain  
measures or epochs, is that which most properly we  
call Time.” And as we are commonly undisturbed  
by “the inaudible and noiseless foot of Time,” it  
must be that the sounding clock of the years which  
tells us that another period is passed should arouse  
us to thought and reflection.  
If heard aright,  
  
It is the knell of our departed hours :  
  
Where are they? With the years beyond the flood.  
  
It is a signal that demands despatch :  
  
How much is to be done?

here the spirit  
drove; but the fact was that Cowley did not understand the  
principle of Pindar’s form, and mistook it for formlessness.  
However admirable writing an ode may contain, unless the  
principle of its construction appear, half the pleasure is lost;  
and on this account, as well as their frequent prosiness, Cowley’s  
odes must be pronounced failures, all but the magnificent Ode to  
the Royal Society, which is admirable in both matter and manner.  
From the rest the reader will but glean a line here and a phrase  
there to please him. Thus, in one he says of Fame in a fine,  
  
ironical couplet :  
Some with vast, costly tombs would purchase it,  
And by the proofs of death pretend to live.

Be wise to-day ; ’tis madness to defer ;  
  
Next day the fatal precedent will plead ;  
Thus on, till wisdom is pushed out of life.  
Procrastination is the thief of time ;  
  
Year after year it steals, till all are fled,  
  
And to the mercies of a moment leaves  
  
The vast concerns of an eternal scene.  
  
If not so frequent, would not this be strange?  
That ’tis so frequent, this is stranger still.
