d therefore be separated, and made to act one against the other. Those Places, to speak in our own old Stile, (Brother Type) may be for the Good of the Chapel, but they are bad for the Master, as they create constant Quarrels that hinder the Business. For example, here are near two Months that your Government has been employ’d in getting its Form to Press; which is not yet fit to work on, every Page of it being squabbled, and the whole ready to fall into Pye. The Founts too must be very scanty, or strangely out of Sorts, since your Compositors cannot find either Upper- or Lower-Case Letters sufficient to set the Word Administration, but are forc’d to be continually Turning for them.— However, to return to common (tho’ perhaps too saucy) Language, don’t despair; you have still one Resource left, and that not a bad one since it may re-unite the Empire. We have some Remains of Affection for you, and shall always be ready to receive and take care of you in case of Distress. So, if you have not Sense and Virtue enough left to govern yourselves, e’en dissolve your present old crazy Constitution, and send Members to Congress.  
You will say my Advice smells of Madeira. You are right. This foolish Letter is mere Chit-chat between ourselves, over the second Bottle: If therefore you show it to any body (except our indulgent Friends Dagge &amp; Lady Strachan) I will positively Solless you.  
Yours ever most affectionately

of the war is well worthy of quotation. Al-  
luding to the general scramble there for  
office or money, he said: “To speak in our  
old style (brother type),” these “may be good  
for the chapel, but they are bad for the mas-  
ter, as they create constant quarrels that  
hinder the business. For example, here are  
two months that your government has been  
employed in getting its form to press; which is  
not yet fit to work on, every page of it being  
squabbled, and the whole ready to fall into  
pi. The fonts, too, must be very scanty, or  
strangely out of sorts, since your compositors  
cannot find either upper or lower case letters  
sufficient to set the word ADMINISTRATION,  
but are forced to be continually turning for  
them. However, toreturn to common (though  
perhaps too saucy) language, do not despair;  
you have still one resource left, and that not  
a bad one, since it may reunite the empire.  
We have some remains of affection for you,  
and shall always be ready to receive and  
take care of you in case of distress. So if  
you have not sense and virtue enough to  
govern yourselves, e’en dissolve your present  
old crazy constitution, and send members to

Congress.” With even greater cleverness of  
metaphor, Franklin later told him:
