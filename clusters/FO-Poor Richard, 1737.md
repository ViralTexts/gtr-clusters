l be generally allow’d That we always hit the Day of the Month, and that I suppose is esteem’d one of the most useful Things in an Almanack.  
As to the Weather, if I were to fall into the Method my Brother J----n sometimes uses, and tell you, Snow here or in New England,—Rain here or in South-Carolina, —Cold to the Northward, —Warm to the Southward, and the like, whatever Errors I might commit, I should be something more secure of not being detected in them: But I consider, it will be of no Service to any body to know what Weather it is 1000 miles off, and therefore I always set down positively what Weather my Reader will have, be he where he will at the time. We modestly desire only the favourable Allowance of a day or two before and a day or two after the precise Day against which the Weather is set; and if it does not come to pass accordingly, let the Fault be laid upon the Printer, who, ’tis very like, may have transpos’d or misplac’d it, perhaps for the Conveniency of putting in his Holidays: And since, in spight of all I can say, People will give him great part of the Credit of making my Almanacks, ’tis but reasonable he should take some share of the Blame.

The Leaf figur’d in the Margin is one of the largest; for the most part they are not near so big though the Shape be the same.  
  
Hints for those that would be Rich.  
The Use of Money is all the Advantage there is in having Money.  
For £6 a Year, you may have the Use of £100 if you are a Man of known Prudence and Honesty.  
He that spends a Groat a day idly, spends idly above £6 a year, which is the Price of using £100.  
He that wastes idly a Groat’s worth of his Time per Day, one Day with another, wastes the Privilege of using £100 each Day.  
He that idly loses 5s. worth of time, loses 5s. and might as prudently throw 5s. in the River.  
He that loses 5s. not only loses that Sum, but all the Advantage that might be made by turning it in Dealing, which by the time that a young Man becomes old, amounts to a comfortable Bag of Money.  
Again, He that sells upon Credit, asks a Price for what he sells, equivalent to the Principal and Interest of his Money for the Time he is like to be kept out of it: therefore  
He that buys upon Credit, pays Interest for what he buys.  
And he that pays ready Money, might let that Money out to Use: so that  
He that possesses any Thing he has bought, pays Interest for the Use of it.  
Consider then, when you are tempted to buy any unnecessary Housholdstuff, or any superfluous thing, whether you will be willing to pay Interest, and Interest upon Interest for it as long as you live; and more if it grows worse by using.  
Yet, in buying Goods, ’tis best to pay ready Money, because,  
He that sells upon Credit, expects to lose 5 per Cent. by bad Debts; therefore he charges, on all he sells upon Credit, an Advance that shall make up that Deficiency.  
Those who pay for what they buy upon Credit, pay their Share of this Advance.  
He that pays ready Money, escapes or may escape that Charge.  
A Penny sav’d is Twopence clear, A Pin a day is a Groat a Year. Save and have. Every little makes a mickle

t way to come at glory, is to do that for conscience which we do for glory.  
There is much money given to be laught at, though the purchasers don’t know it; witness A’s fine horse, and B’s fine house.  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
  
A Nymph and a Swain to Apollo once pray’d;  
The Swain had been jilted, the Nymph been betray’d.  
They came for to try if his Oracle knew  
E’er a Nymph that was chast or a Swain that was true.  
Apollo stood mute, and had like t’have been pos’d;  
At length he thus sagely the question disclos’d:  
He alone may be true in whom none will confide,  
And the nymph may be chast that has never been tryd.  
  
He that can compose himself, is wiser than he that composes books.  
Poor Dick, eats like a well man, and drinks like a sick.  
After crosses and losses men grow humbler and wiser.  
Love, Cough, and a Smoke, can’t well be hid.  
III Mon. May hath xxxi days.  
  
Rich Gripe does all his Thoughts and Cunning bend  
T’encrease that Wealth he wants the Soul [to] spend:  
Poor Shifter does his whole Contrivance set,  
To spend that Wealth he wants the Sense to get.  
How happy would appear to each his Fate,  
Had Gripe his Humour, or he Gripe’s Estate?  
  
Kind Fate and Fortune, blend ’em if you can,  
And of two Wretches make one happy Man.  
  
Well done is better than well said.  
  
Fine linnen, girls and gold so bright,  
Chuse not to take by candle-light.  
  
He that can travel well afoot, keeps a good horse.  
There are no ugly Loves, nor handsome Prisons.

Necessary Hints to those that would be  
Kich—written by Benj. Franklin, 1738.  
  
The use of money is all the advantage there is  
in having money,  
  
For six pounds a year you may have the use of  
one hundred pounds, provided you are a man of  
known prudence and honesty.  
  
He that spends a groat a day idly, spends idly  
above six pounds a year, which is the price for  
the use of one hundred pounds.  
  
He that wastes idly 2 groat’s worth of his  
time per day, one day with another, wastes the  
privilege of using one hundred pounds each day.  
  
He that idly loses five shillings worth of time,  
loses five shillings, and might as prudently throw  
five shillings into the sea.  
  
He that loses five shillings, not only loses that  
sum, but all the advantages that might be made  
by turning it in dealing; which, by the time that  
a young man becomes old, will amount to a con-  
siderable sum of money.  
  
Again; he that sells upon credit, asks a price  
for what he sells equivalent to the principal and  
interest of his money for the time he is to be  
kept out of it; therefore, he that buys upon cre-  
dit, pays interest for what he buys; and he that  
pays ready money, might let that money out to  
use ; so that he that possesses any thing he has  
bought, pays interest for the use of it.  
  
Yet, in buying goods, it is best to pay ready  
money, because he that sells upon credit, expects  
to lose five per cent. by bad debts; therefore he  
charges, on all he sells upon credit, an advance  
that shall make up that deficiency  
  
Those who pay for what they buy upon credit,  
pay their share of this advance.  
He that pays ready money, escapes, or may es-  
cape, that charge.  
A penny saved is two-pence clear;  
A pin a day’s a groat a year.

“He that sells upon credit asks a price  
for what he sells equivalent to the prin­  
cipal and interest of his money for the  
time lie is likely to he kept out of it.  
Therefore he that buys upon credit pays  
interest for what he buys. And ho that  
pays ready money might let that money  
out to use ; so that he that possesses any  
thing he has bought pays interest for the  
use ol it.”  
“ Consider then when you are tempted  
to buy any unnecessary household stuff  
or any superfluous thing, whether you  
will he willing to pay interest upon interest  
for it as long as you live, and more if  
it grows worse by using.”  
“ A penny saved is two pence clear.  
A pin a day is a goal a year. Save and  
have. Every little makes a mickle.

may have the use of one hundred pounds,

prudence and honesty. He that spends a

anything he has bought pays interest for  
the use of it. Yet, in buying goods, it  
is best to pay ready money, because he  
that sells upon credit expects to lose  
five per ceut. by bad debts; therefore  
he charges on all he sells upon credit  
an advance that shall make up that  
deficiency. Those who pay for what they  
buy upon credit pay their share of this
