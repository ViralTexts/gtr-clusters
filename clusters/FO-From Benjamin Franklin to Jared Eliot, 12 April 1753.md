Philada. April 12. 1753  
I received your Favour of March 26. and thank you for communicating to me, the very ingenious Letter from your Friend Mr. Todd, with whom, if it may be agreable to him, I would gladly entertain a Correspondence. I shall consider his Objections till next Post.  
I thank you also for the Hint concerning the Word Adhesion, which should be defin’d. When I speak of Particules of Water adhering to Particles of Air, I mean not a firm Adhesion but a loose one, like that of a Drop of Water to the End of an Icicle before freezing. The firm Adhesion is after it is frozen.  
I conceive that the original constituent Particles of Water are perfectly hard, round and smooth. If so, there must be Interstices, and yet the Mass incompressible. A Box fill’d with small Shot, has many Interstices, and the Shot may be compress’d because they are not perfectly hard. If they were, the Interstices would remain the same, notwithstanding the greatest Pressure, and would admit Sand, &amp;c. as Water admits Salt.  
Our Vessel, named the Argo, is gone for the N.W. Passage; and the Capt. has borrowed my Journals of the last Voyage, except one Vol. of a broken Set, which I send you. I enclose a Letter from our Friend Mr. Collinson: and am promis’d some Speltz which I shall send per next Post.  
The Tatler tells us of a Girl who was observ’d to grow suddenly proud, and none could guess the Reason, till it came to be known that she had got on a pair of new Silk Garters. Lest you should be puzzel’d to guess the Cause when you observe any thing of the kind in me, I think I will not hide my new Garters under my Petticoats, but take the Freedom to show them to you, in a Paragraph of our Friend Collinson’s last Letter viz.—But I ought to mortify, and not indulge, this Vanity; I will not transcribe the Paragraph.—Yet I cannot forbear. “If any of thy Friends (says Peter) should take Notice that thy Head is held a little higher up than formerly, let them know; when the Grand Monarch of France strictly commands the Abbé Mazeas to write a Letter in the politest Terms to the Royal Society, to return the Kings Thanks and Compliments in an express Manner to Mr. Franklin of Pennsilvania, for the useful Discoveries in Electricity, and Application of the pointed Rods to prevent the terrible Effects of Thunderstorms. I say, after all this, is not some Allowance to be made if the Crest is a little elevated. There are four Letters containing very curious Experiments on thy Doctrine of Points and its Verification, which will be printed in the New Transactions. I think now I have stuck a Feather on thy Cap, I may be allowed to conclude in wishing thee long to wear it. Thine, P. Collinson.” On reconsidering this Paragraph, I fear I have not so much Reason to be proud as the Girl had; for a Feather in the Cap is not so useful a Thing, or so serviceable to the Wearer, as a Pair of good Silk Garters. The Pride of Man is very differently gratify’d, and had his Majesty sent me a Marshal’s Staff, I think I should scarce have been so proud of it as I am of your Esteem, and of subscribing my self with Sincerity Dear Sir, Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant  
B Franklin

I conceive that the original constituent particles of water  
are perfectly hard, round and smooth. If so, there must be  
interstices, and yet the mass incompressible. A box filled  
with smal] shot, has many interstices, and the shot may  
be compressed, because they are not perfectly, hard. If  
they were, the interstices would remain the same, notwith-  
standing the greatest pressure, and would admit sand, &amp;c.  
as water admits salt.  
  
Our vessel, named the Argo, is gone for the north-west  
passage; and the Capt. has borrowed my journals of the  
last voyage, except one Vol. broken set, which I send you.  
I enclose a letter from our friend Mr. Collinson: and am  
promised some speltz which I shall send per next post.  
  
The Tatler tells us of a girl who was observed to grow  
suddenly proud, and none could guess the reason, till it  
came to be known that she had got on a pair of new silk  
garters. Lest you should be puzzled to guess the cause  
when you observe any thing of the kind in me, I think I  
will not hide my new garters under my petticoats, but take  
the freedom to show them to you, ina paragraph of our  
friend Collinson’s last letter, viz.—But I ought to mortify,  
and not rom ¢ this vanity.—I will not transcribe the para-  
graph.—Yet I cannot forbear.—* If any of thy friends (says  
Peter,) “should take notice that thy head is held a little  
higher up than formerly, let them know; when the Grand  
Monarch of France strictly commands the Abbe’ Mazeas to  
write a letter in the politest terms to the Royal Society, to  
return the king’s thanks and compliments in an express man.  
ner, to Mr. Franklin of Philadelphia, for the useful discove-  
ries in Electricity, and application of the pointed rods to  
prevent the terrible effects of thunder storms: I say af-  
ter all this, is not some allowance to be made if the crest is  
a little elevated. There are four letters containing very cu-  
rious experiments on thy doctrine of Points and its verifica-  
tion, which will be printed in the New Translations. 1

allowed to conclude in wishing thee long to wear it.  
  
Thine P. COLLINSON.”  
  
On reconsidering this paragraph, I fear I have not so much  
reason to be proud as the girl had; for a feather in the cap,
