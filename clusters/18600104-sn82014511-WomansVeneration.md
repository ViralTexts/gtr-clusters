Woman&#x27;s Veneration  
[From the Minister&#x27;s Wooing]  
  
If women have one weakness more marked than another, it is towards veneration. They are born worshippers,—makers of silver shrines for some divinity or other, which, of course, they always think fell straight down from heaven. The first step towards their falling in love with an ordinary mortal is generally to dress him out with all manner of real or fancied superiority; and having made him up, they worship him. Now a truly great man, a man really grand and noble in heart and intellect, has this advantage with women, that he is an idol ready-made to hand; and so that very painstaking and ingenious sex have less labor in getting him up, and can be ready to worship him on shorter notice. In particular is this the case where a sacred profession and a moral supremacy are added to the intellectual. Just think of the career of celebrated preachers and divines in all ages. Have they not stood like the image that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar the king set up,&quot; and all womankind, coquettes and flirts not excepted, been ready to fall down and worship, even before the sound of cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, and so forth? Is not the faithful Paula, with her beautiful face, prostrate in reverence before poor, old, lean, haggard, dying St. Jerome, in the most splendid painting of the world, an emblem and sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power of self-sacrifice to what she deems noblest in man? Does not old Richard Baxter tell us, with delightful single-heartedness, how his wife fell in love with him first, spite of his long, pale face,—and how she confessed, dear soul, after many years of married life, that she had found him less sour and bitter than she had expected? The fact is, women are burdened with fealty faith, reverence, more than they know what to do with; they stand like a hedge of sweet-peas, throwing out fluttering tendrils everywhere for something high and strong to climb by,—and when they find it, be it ever so rough in the bark, they catch upon it. And instances are not wanting of those who have turned away from the flattery of admirers to prostrate themselves at the feet of a genuine hero who never wooed them, except by heroic deeds and the rhetoric of a noble life.

WolHRu?s Venerations  
IFromn the MinisT r&#x27;s Wooing.I  
If women have one weakness more marked  
than man, it is toward veneration. They are  
born worshippers,-makers of silver shrines  
for some divinity or other, which, of course,  
they always think fell straight down from  
heaven. The first step towards their falling  
in love with an ordinary morial is generally to  
dress him out with all manner of real or fancied  
superiority,-and, having made him up, they  
worship him. Now, a truly great man, a man  
really grand and noble in art and intellect, has  
this advantage with women, that he is an idol  
ready made to hand; and so that very painsta­  
king and ingenious sex have less labor in get­  
ting him up, and can be ready to worship him  
on shorter notice. In particular is this the case  
where a sacred profession and a moral suprem­  
acy are added to the intellectual. Just think of  
the career of celebrated preachers and divines  
in all ages. Have they not stood like the image  
that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar the King set up,&quot;  
and all women kind, coquettes and flirts not  
excepted, been ready to fall down and wor­  
ship, even before the sound of cornet, flute,  
harp, sackbut, and so forth. Is not the faith­  
ful Pauln, with her beautiful face, prostrate in  
reverence before poor, old, lean, haggard, dy-  
ing St. Jerome, in the most splendid painting  
in the world, an emblem and a sign of woman&#x27;s  
eternal power of self-sacrifice to what she  
deems nob est in man?? Does not old Richard  
Baxter tell us, with delightful single-hearted­  
ness, how his wife fell in love with him first,  
spite of his long pale face; and how she con-

&#x27;s VeneratIOn. If women  
have one weakness more marked than  
an, it is towaid veneration. They  
are born worshippers- makers of sil­  
ver shrines in some divinity or other,  
which of course they always think  
fall straight down from heaven. The  
first step toward their falling in love  
with an ordinary mortal, is generally  
to dress him out with manner of real  
or fancied superiority; and having  
made him up, they worship him.  
Now, a truly great man, a man really  
grand and noble in art and intellect,  
has this advantage with women, that  
he is an idol ready made to hand;  
and so that very pain-taking and in­  
genious sex have less labor in getting  
him up, and can be ready to worship  
him on shortor notice. In particular  
is this the case where a sacred pro­  
fession and a moral supremacy are  
added to the intellectual. Just think  
of the career of celebrated preachers  
and divines in all ages.  
Have they not stood like the im­  
age that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar, the  
King set up,&quot; and all womankind  
(coquettes and flirts not excepted)  
been ready to fall down and wor­  
ship even before the sound of cor­  
net, flute, harp, sackbut, and so  
forth, and so forth, and so forth? Is  
not the faithful Paula, with her  
beautiful face, prostrate in rever­  
ence before poor, old, lean, hag­  
gard, dying St. Jerome, in the  
most splendid painting of the world,  
an emblem and a sign of woman&#x27;s  
eternal power of self-sacrifice to  
what she deems noblest in man?­  
Does not old Richard Baxter tell  
us, with delightful single-hearted­  
ness, how his wife fell in love with  
him first, spite of his long pale  
face; and how she confessed, dear  
soul, after mary years of married  
life, that she had found him less  
sour and bitter than she had ex  
pected?. The fact is, women are
