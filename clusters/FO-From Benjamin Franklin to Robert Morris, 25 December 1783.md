ur States might be diminished by Accounts from hence, was occasioned by the extravagant and violent Language held here by a Public Person in public Company, which had that  
  
Tendency; and it was natural for me to think his Letters might hold the same Language; in which I was right; for I have since had Letters from Boston informing me of it. Luckily here, and I hope there, it is imputed to the true Cause; a Disorder in the Brain; which tho’ not constant has its Fits too frequent.

The Remissness of our People in Paying Taxes is highly blameable, the Unwillingness to pay them is still more so. I see in some Resolutions of Town-Meetings, a Remonstrance against giving Congress a Power to take as they call it, the People’s Money out of their Pockets tho’ only to pay the Interest and Principal of Debts duly contracted. They seem to mistake the Point. Money justly due from the People is their Creditors’ Money, and no longer the Money of the People, who, if they withold it, should be compell’d to pay by some Law. All  
  
Property indeed, except the Savage’s temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents &amp; all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity &amp; the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man for the Conservation of the Individual &amp; the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who by their Laws have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire &amp; live among Savages.— He can have no right to the Benefits of Society who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it.  
The Marquis de la F. who loves to be employ’d in our Affairs, and is often very useful, has lately had several Conversations with the Ministers &amp; Persons concern’d in forming new Regulations respecting the Commerce between our two Countries, which are not yet concluded. I therefore thought it well to communicate to him a Copy of your Letter, which contains so many sensible and just Observations on that Subject. He will make a proper Use of them, and perhaps they may have more Weight as appearing to come from a French man, than they would have if it were known that they were the Observations of an American. I perfectly agree with you in all the Sentiments you have express’d on this Occasion.  
You have made no Answer to the Proposition I sent of furnishing Tobacco to the Farmers General. They have since made a Contract with Messrs. Alexander &amp; Williams for the same Purpose; but it is such a One as does not prevent their making another with you, if hereafter it should suit you. I am sorry for the Publick’s sake that you are about to quit your Office, but on  
  
personal Considerations I shall congratulate you. For I cannot conceive of a more happy Man, than he who having been long loaded with public Cares, finds himself reliev’d from them, &amp; enjoying private Repose in the Bosom of his Friends &amp; Family.

the unwillingness to pay them is still more so. I see in some reso-  
lutions of town meetings, a remonstrance against giving Congress a power  
to take, as they call it, the people’s money out of their pockets, though only  
to pay the.interest and principal of debts duly contracted. They seem to  
mistake the point. Money justly due from the people, is their creditor’s  
money, and no longer the money of the people, who, if they withhold it,  
should be compelled to pay by some Jaw. All property, indeed, except  
the savage’s temporary cabin, his bow, his matchuat, and other little ac-  
quisitions absolutely necessary for his subsistence, seems to me to be the

the conservation of the individual, and the propagation of the species, is  
his natural right, which none can justly deprive him of; but all property  
superfluous to such purposes, is the property of the public, who, by their  
laws, have created it, and who may, therefore, by other laws, dispose of  
it whenever the welfare of the public shall desire such a disposition. He  
that does not like civil society on these terms, let him retire, and live  
among the savages! He can have no right to the benefits of society, who  
will not pay his club towards the support of it.  
  
“The Marquis de Lafayette, who loves to be employed in our affairs, and

It has been fully proved that to take up  
the theory of common property in land is  
to return to a system which we have long

long since abandoned. Thus the Iroquoi
