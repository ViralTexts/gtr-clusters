*House Cleaning**  
  
BY WITCH Hazel  
  
Every year I endeavor to make some improvement in my method of house cleaning. This spring, I made up my mind to adhere no longer to the poky old plan of my grandmother—which was to begin in the attic, and wind up in the cellar—but determined to strike out in another direction; and so, while the subject was rife in my mind, I set about executing my new plan at once although it was but the first of April, and the weather quite chilly and raw. In the first place, I had every stove moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the pictures removed from the walls, the curtains down, everything piled out on the back porch, and the carpetless halls crammed to overflowing with books, chairs, statues, feather dusters, vases, hair mattresses, parian brackets, and pillows; and while everything was in the wildest confusion, Frank came in with distended eyes.  
  
&#x27;What on earth is all this, Hattie?&#x27; he exclaimed.  
  
&#x27;Why Frank,&#x27; I replied, pausing in my efforts to reach a swaying cobweb, &#x27;we have commenced cleaning house,&#x27; and I lowered my broom, and looked straight in his face to see if he fully realized the importance of these words; but to my chagrin, he looked utterly indifferent, and brushing off some stray cobwebs which had floated down from the ceiling, on to his coat sleeve, asked impatiently, &#x27;Isn&#x27;t dinner ready?&#x27; &#x27;Dinner!&#x27; I cried; &#x27;I had no idea it was so late. I haven&#x27;t even commenced dinner yet.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Pretty state of affairs,&#x27; grumbled Frank. &#x27;I brought Ed Graham home with me.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Where is he?&#x27; I asked faintly.  
  
&#x27;In the parlor,&#x27; replied Frank crustily. &#x27;The floor is bare; there is&#x27;n a chair or anything else for the man to sit on. I expect to find him seated on the piano. But come, Hattie,&#x27; he added, &#x27;what are you going to give us to eat?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;O, Frank,&#x27; I said coaxingly, thinking of my rought hair and the grease spot on my dress, &#x27;can&#x27;t you get your dinner down town to-day?&#x27;  
  
Frank looked cross, and said he supposed he could, and went down to the parlor. I leaned over the banister, and when Frank opened the door, caught a glimpse of Ed roaming around the desolate room, shivering with his hands in his pockets. I watched them go through the hall heard Frank make some hateful remarks about women and house cleaning. He slammed the door violently, and I serenely resumed my sweeping, not in the least disturbed by Franks unconcealed annoyance and provoking manner. Frank was always a little unreasonable; and he was always bringing someone home to dinner when I least expected it.  
  
Just then, little Ted came toddling in, and wanted to help. As I was about to make a change of base, I took him with me down to the parlor, gave him a rag and a basin of water, and told him he might clean the floor. He sat down in one corner of the room, and with a face of most unearthly solemnity, at once commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Norah was up stairs, washing windows in the front chamber. Suddenly there came a loud crash, followed by a terrific yell; it sounded as if the whole house was tumbling down. &#x27;Heavens!&#x27; I exclaimed, &#x27;what can have happened.&#x27; I mounted the stairs, two steps at a time, and there beheld Norah lying full length on the floor, admist a debris of broken step ladder, pieces of glass and soap suds.  
  
&#x27;What is the matter?&#x27; I cried to the groaning girl.  
  
&#x27;Shure, mum, I fell of the ladder the windy, an&#x27; cut myself most awful,&#x27; moaned the terrified girl.  
  
I helped the heavy girl to arise, bound up her lacerated arm, left her to pick up the fragments of glass and wood, and returned to the palor to find Ted scouring the piano legs with the scrubbing brush. I quickly relieved him from all further labor, bundled him up and sent him out in the yard to play.  
  
&#x27;Faith mum,&#x27; said Norah, standing in the door, &#x27;I feel so faint, an&#x27; an if I don&#x27;t make something strong I can&#x27;t work no more to-day.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Then make you some tea,&#x27; I replied.  
  
But Norah disdainfully said, &#x27;Shure I never could take tea; the very smill of it makes me sick.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Well, then, take some brandy,&#x27; I replied. Now I ought to have known better than to allow Norah to help herself to the brandy, but being in such a hurry to finish the parlor I could not conveniently stop. When I had occasion to go through the hall again, I paused and listened; I could hear nothing of Norah moving about, so once more I mounted the stairs. There, in the midst of the room, she sat in a rocking chair, a bucket of water stood before her, while she swayed laizily back and forth with the mop in her hand, which left a long trail of dirty water behind it.  
  
&#x27;Norah,&#x27; I cried, &#x27;didn&#x27;t I tell you to mop this floor?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Faith, mum, and I am doing it as fast as I can,&#x27; she replied.  
  
&#x27;How can you mop sitting down?&#x27; I asked indignantly.  
  
&#x27;Get up out of that chair,&#x27; I said. Norah slowly arose and staggered against the wall.  
  
&#x27;Hie, mum, hie, yez see I&#x27;s very wake.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;You&#x27;re drunk, you had better say,&#x27; I replied.  
  
&#x27;Drunk, d&#x27;ye call it!&#x27; exclaimed Norah angrily, trying to look dignified; &#x27;drunk, after taking one tay-spoonful of brandy in a quart of water!&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Leave the room and go to bed,&#x27; I said indignantly; &#x27;to-morrow I shall dismiss you.&#x27;  
  
After much arguing Norah finally decided to retire, and I was sole monarch of all the dirt and disorder. I surveyed the room in despair, but the word had to be done, and I seized the mop and soon finished. When I was about to descend the stairs, all tired and dirty, I heard Frank calling, &#x27;Hattie! where in the world are you?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Here,&#x27; I replied.  
  
Frank came up the uncarpeted stairs and tumbled over the mop. &#x27;Confound it!&#x27; he cried &#x27;the house is as dark as Egypt? Well,&#x27; he went on, &#x27;are we going supperless as well as dinnerless?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;There is no fire made,&#x27; I said, &#x27;and Norah is drunk, and I am tired to death; and—and&#x27; here I burst into tears, and sat down on the wet floor.  
  
&#x27;Why Hattie! what are you crying about! I&#x27;ll make the fire; never mind about the supper; had a capital dinner down town; come down stairs out of this damp room.&#x27; And Frank, who always got good and sorry the moment after he was cross, helped me off the floor, and down stairs into the kitchen. &#x27;Now don&#x27;t cry any more,&#x27; he said wiping the tears from my cheeks with his handkerchief; sit down, and I&#x27;ll have a fire in two minutes.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Where is Ted?&#x27; he inquired, pausing between the vigorous puffs at the fire.  
  
&#x27;I have not seen him all afternoon. I sent him out to play, and he hasn&#x27;t been in since,&#x27; I replied.  
  
Frank dropped the shavings and started out in search of him. I waited and waited, and shivered with the cold, but no Frank came. I sat in the stiff-backed chair and closed my eyes. The last thing I remembered was a violent nod which pretty nearly dislocated my neck.  
  
&#x27;Hattie!&#x27; I awoke with a start. Frank was shaking me.  
  
&#x27;You will take your death of cold; you have been fast asleep.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Where is Ted? did you find him in the cistern?&#x27; I asked dreamily.  
  
&#x27;No,&#x27; laughed Frank, &#x27;but about as bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar, asleep like his mother.&#x27;  
  
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child; he was covered with coal dust from head to foot, and was black as a negro. Frank prepared supper, while I washed Ted&#x27;s face and hands.  
  
&#x27;How can you finish your cleaning without Norah?&#x27; he inquired.  
  
&#x27;I am sure I don&#x27;t see how I can,&#x27; I replied as the mountains of work arose in my troubled mind. &#x27;Norah must be sent away in the morning.&#x27;  
  
We all ate heartily of our supper, notwithstanding the eggs were fried until they were so crisp that they would break into bits if you such much as looked at them, and the toast was burnt, and the coffee not half boiled; still as I was ravenously hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After we had cleared the table and piled the dishes away to be washed in the morning, we retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken until late in the morning. Norah was dismissed, Frank went to his office, and I to my cleaning. Frank had shaken the carpets, and the parlor floor being dry, I soon had it all tacked down; then moved the chairs in, and began to dust the mantle ornaments, but O horror! I let fall one of my loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand fragments. A very bad beginning of the day, I thought sorrowfully, picking up the pieces.  
  
&#x27;Mamma,&#x27; cried a shrill voice, &#x27;I&#x27;s all jess up.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Where are you Ted?&#x27; I called.  
  
&#x27;Here,&#x27; cried Ted.  
  
&#x27;And where is &#x27;here;&#x27; you&#x27;re in some mischief I&#x27;ll be bound.&#x27;  
  
I heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, and a great scrambling up the attic stairs. After I had thrown the shattered pieces of my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what he was doing. What a sight met my eyes? Ted was arrayed in my violet silk, pinned up in front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my best bonnet on his head. I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted went prancing round and round in the dust and dirt of the attic; then I started after him. Of course he ran, screaming and laughing. &#x27;Take care,&#x27; I cried, but too late; he fell from the top to the bottom of the stairs.  
  
Rip, rip, went my violet silk; bump, bump went Ted. I flew down to the bottom of the stairs, and picked up a little insensible heap of lace, ribbons, silk, and dirt. That fall saved Ted from a good whipping. I carried him down stairs, and sprinkled him profusely with water, and camphor, until he opened his eyes; then I examined my ruined clothes. My dress was a mass of cobwebs, grease, and dust; the front width was wretchedly torn with pins; my shawl and bonnet were crushed and torn. I put them all away with a sigh of regret, and turned my attention once more to the prepetrator of this terrible deed. Just then some one knocked at the back door. On opening it I found a stout German girl on the step; she talked so broken that I could scarcely understand her, but managed to comprehend enough to know that Frank had engaged her for me. I set her to work immediately to clearn the china closet, and returned to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I heard a terrible crash in the dining room. &#x27;Heavens!&#x27; I exclaimed; &#x27;what can have happened *now*? and rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping and unclasping her hands in a heart rending manner. No wonder. She had upset the table on which all my shining glass and china was placed. Everything was literally smashed to pieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My goblets, and tea set! My fruit stands! Was there ever such a poor afflicted mortal as I? Words fail me to express my feelings at that moment. I sat down, perfectly stunned, to witness the harrowing sight of all my superb dishes swept away.  
  
There came another knock at the door. This time an Irish girl made her appearance. I wonder if Frank intended to send a regiment to destroy my house. However, I took her in, and the first thing I told her to do was answer the door bell, which had rung twice. I peeped through the door, which was partly open, and saw two ladies, but could not distinguish who they were.  
  
&#x27;Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to see yez,&#x27; said Ann, giving the door a violent push against my head.  
  
&#x27;Go tell them to excuse me,&#x27; I said, and being very dizzy from the blow, I did not notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the sitting room door open, and as the ladies came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.  
  
&#x27;O mortification!&#x27; I was all rags and dirt, but had become somewhat reconciled to my misfortunes by this time.  
  
When Frank cmae home to supper, the hall was very dark; Ann was putting down the door mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant, and in the darkness mistook the horrid girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed and ran, and fell over a chair. Frank tore round and swore; said he would rather be in bedlam than where a woman was cleaning house; wondered why I couldn&#x27;t have the hall lighted. To all this I made no reply, but smiled grimly, being so overwhelmed with my griefs, I did not care if Frank kissed every servant girl in the United States.  
  
The next morning the German girl left. Probably she was fearful she would counter my frowns again. Ann remained and we proceeded to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously begun by Ann, who succeeded charmingly in breaking the globes of the chandelier, and then upsetting my gold fish. I was exasperated at this. There lay my fish on the carpet, to say nothing of the water. I believe I shook or slapped the girl. I don&#x27;t remember which. Ann was astonished at seeing me fly into such a passion that she baked up against the window, and thrust her clumsy foot through my lace curtain. This was the grand finale. I burst into tears, and so did Ann. Ted, hearing the sobs, came running in, and not knowing what to make of it, joined in and swelled the chorus. Amidst one of our loudest wails, the street door suddenly opened, and in walked my aunt Thankful, with several dozen carpet bags and bundles, prepared evidently for a long visit.  
  
&#x27;In the name of all that&#x27;s wonderful!&#x27; she shrieked, letting all her traps fall. &#x27;What has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded, or the house on fire?&#x27;  
  
I made no reply, but sobbed heedlessly on.  
  
&#x27;Hattie!&#x27; cried aunt Thankful in an awful voice. &#x27;Answer me immediately. What is the matter?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;My lace curtain,&#x27; I gurgled out.  
  
Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat down on the floor and examined it. &#x27;Silly puss,&#x27; she mumbled. &#x27;I can darn that in ten minutes.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Yes, with blue stocking yarn,&#x27; I said, and began to laugh sarcastically, and then I laughed and laughed. Ann laughed, and Ted laughed. Poor Aunt Thankful stared at us in horror, and said:  
  
&#x27;Good Heavens! they are all stark mad;&#x27; and jumping up off the floor, she seized my arm and dragged me into the bed room, and put me to bed, then went out and locked the door, and left me alone. I went to sleep. When I awoke Aunt Thankful was sitting by my bed sewing.  
  
&#x27;Aunt Thankful,&#x27; I said, &#x27;when did you come?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Yesterday morning,&#x27; she replied.  
  
&#x27;What time is it now?&#x27; I inquired.  
  
&#x27;Three o&#x27;clock,&#x27; answered Aunt Thankful.  
  
&#x27;I have slept several hours then,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Was I asleep when you came?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;I should rather think not: when I came you were crazy, and I put you to bed. You slept all the rest of the day and night until this blessed minute, and if you hadn&#x27;t been put to bed you would have been in the insane asylum now.&#x27;  
  
I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful glared at me and said:  
  
&#x27;If you laugh any more I will put you into the cellar, and feed you on bread and water for a week.&#x27;  
  
This not being a pleasant prospect, I subsided.  
  
&#x27;You are a precious woman to clean house,&#x27; continued she. &#x27;I should have tought a child would know better than to commence in the attic and go down. Don&#x27;t know you that after you get through with the down stairs the dirt from the attic will make it dirtier than ever?&#x27;  
  
&#x27;I never thought of that,&#x27; I answered meekly.  
  
&#x27;And then to begin when it&#x27;s cold enough to freeze. It&#x27;s a wonder you didn&#x27;t have the lung fever, or something worse,&#x27; went on Aunt Thankful.  
  
&#x27;I must get up and clean the attic,&#x27; I said.  
  
&#x27;No you won&#x27;t,&#x27; said Aunt Thankful, &#x27;for I cleaned it myself.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Well, there are the rest of the carpets to put down.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;They&#x27;re all down.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;And the pictures.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;All hung.&#x27;  
  
I gave a great sigh of relief. What would I have done if it had not been for Aunt Thankful! She had accomplished in one day what it would have taken me a week to perform; but then I never could bob round like Aunt Thankful; she seems to be made of wire. I have learned since then to take Aunt Thankful&#x27;s advice, never to commence cleaning until the weather is warm, and never to commence at the wrong end of the house.  
  
But it was such a mortification to think that my new plan was a total failure.—*Hearth and Home*.

Then make yourself some tea,” I replied.  
  
But Norah disdainfully said, “ Shure |

‘ Well, then, take some brandy,” I replied.  
  
I ought to have known better than to  
yw Norah to help herself to the brandy,  
but being in such a hurry to finish the parlor  
I could not conveniently stop. When I had  
occasion to go through the hall ain, |  
yvaused and listened; 1 could hear action of  
\ rah moving about, so once more I mount  
ed th: stairs. Tuere, in the middie of the  
room, she sat in a rocking chair, a bucket of  
water stc od be ure her, while she swayed lazily  
back and forth with the mop in her hand,  
which left a long trail of dirty water behind  
it.  
  
“Norah,” I cried, “didn’t I tell you to  
mop this floor ?”  
  
* Faith, mam, and I’m doin’ it as fast as |  
can,” she replied,  
  
“How can you mop  
asked ind gnantiy.  
  
“ Get right up out of that chair,” I said.  
Norah slowly arose and staggered against the  
wail.  
  
“ Hic, mum, hic, yez see I&#x27;s very wake.”  
¢.“ You&#x27;re drunk, you had better say,” I re-

sitting down?” I  
  
Drunk, d’ye call it!” exclaimed Norab,  
y, trying to look dignified; “ drunk,  
takin’ one tay-spoonful of brandy in a  
t water!” ,  
Leave the room and go to bed,” I said  
yoantly; “to-morrow I shall dismiss  
you,”  
  
After much arguing Norah finally decided  
to retire, and J was left sole monarch of ail  
the dirt and disoider, I surveyed the room  
for a while in despair, but the work had to be  
  
ie, and | seized the mop and soon finish-  
e!. When I was about to descend the stairs,  
sl tired afd dirty, I heard Frank’ calling,  
Hattie! where in the world are  
  
’  
* Hattie  
  
you  
  
« Here,” I replied.  
  
Frank came up the uncarpeted stirs ana  
s umbled over the mop. “ Confound it!” he  
ccied, “ why is this house asdark as Egypt ?”  
  
&quot;he went on, “ are we to go supper-  
weil as dinnerless ?”  
  
‘There is no fire made,” I said, “ and  
  
rah is drank, and 1 am tired to death ;  
  
snd—” here 1 burst into tears, and sat  
lown on the wet floor.  
  
‘Why, Hattie! Hattie! what are you  
crying about! I&#x27;ll make the fire ; uever mind  
about the supper; had a capital dinner down  
town: come down stairs out of this damp  
ro m.” And Frank, who always got good  
  
orry the moment after he was cross,  
helped me up off the floor, and down stairs  
into the kitchen, “Now don’t cry any  
more,” he said, wiping my tear-bedewed  
cheeks with his handkerchief; “sit down,  
end T’ll have a fire in two minutes.”  
  
« Where’s Ted ?” be inquired, pausing for  
breath between the vigorous puffs at the fire.  
  
* | haven’t seen him all the afternoon.

cant you get your dinner Gown town | her in, and the first thing I told her to do| of his boots!”  
  
was to answer the door bell, which had rung |  
twice. I peeped through the door, which |  
was partly open, and saw two ladies, but  
could nut distinguish who they were.  
  
“Mum, there are two wimmen as wants|  
to see yez,” said Ann, giving the doora  
violent push against my head.  
  
“ Go tell them to excuse me,” I said ; and  
being very dizzy from the blow, I failed to  
notice that Ann, io her stupidity, had left  
the sitting room door wide open, and as the}  
ladies came out of the parlor, they saw me  
plainly.  
  
“O mortification ! I was all rage and  
dirt, but had become somewhat reconciled  
to my misfortunes by this time.  
  
When Frank came up to supper, the hall  
was very dark; Ann was putting down the  
door mat. Frank forgot all about the new  
servant, and in the darkness mistook the  
horrid Irish girl for me, and kissed her. Ann  
screamed and ran, and fell over a chair.  
Frenk tore round and swore; said he would  
rather be in vbedlam than where a woman  
was cleaning house; wondered why |  
cou dn’t have the hall lighted. ‘To ail this I  
made no reply, but smiled grimly. Being  
so overwhelmed with my griefs, 1 did not  
care if Frank kissed every servant girl in  
the United States.  
  
The next morning the German girl left.  
Probably she was fearful she would encoun-  
ter my frowns again. Ann rem ined, and  
we proceeded to finish our havoc. The day  
was gloriously begun by Ann, who succeed-  
ed charmingly in breaking the globes of the  
chandelier, and then upsetting my gold fish.  
I was exasperated at this. There lay my fish  
on the oarpet, to say nothing of the water.  
I believe I shook or slapped the girl, I don’t  
remember which. Ann was so astonished at  
seeing me fly into such a passion that she  
backed up against the window, and thrust  
her clumsy foot through my lace curtain.  
This was the grand finale. I burst into  
tears, and so did Ann. ‘Ted, hearing the  
sobs, came running in, and not knowing  
what to make of it, joined in and swelled  
the chorus. Amidst one of our longest and  
loudest wails, the street door suddenly flew  
open, and in walked my aunt Thankful, with  
several dozen carpet bags and bundles, pre-  
pared evidently fer a long visit.  
  
“In the name of all that’s wonderfu  
she shrieked, letting all her traps fall.  
“What has tappened? Is Frank dead.  
Ted scalded, or the houwe on fire ?”  
  
I made vo reply, but sobbed heedlessly  
  
1&quot;&quot;  
  
on.  
“ Hattie!” cried auyt Thankful in an  
awful voice. “Answer me immediately.  
What is the matter?”  
  
“ My lace curtain,” I gurgied out.  
  
Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat  
  
dowwiaii the floor and examined it. “ Silly  
| poscrthe mumbled. “Ioan darn that in  
nm minutes.”  
  
* Yes, with blue stocking yarn,” I said,  
and began to laugh sarcastically, and then |  
laughed, and laughed. Ann laughed, and  
Ted laughed. Poor Aunt Thankful stared  
at us in horror, and said :  
  
“Good Heavens! they are all stark  
mad;” and jumping up off the floor, she  
svized my arm and dragged me intu the bed  
room, and put me to bed, then went our and  
locked the door, and left me alone. I went  
to sleep. When I awoke Aunt Thankful  
was sy my bed sewing.  
  
“ Aunt Thankful,” I said, “ when did you  
come ?”  
  
“ Yesterday morning,” she replied.  
  
“ What time is it now?” I inquired.  
  
“ Three o&#x27;clock,” answered Aunt Thank-  
ful.  
“I have slept several hours, then,” I said.  
“ Was Lasleep when you came? ”  
  
“ ] should rather think Cf when I came  
you were crazy, and I put You to bed. You  
slept all the rest of the day and night until  
this blessed minute, and if you hadn’t been  
put to bed you would have been in the in-  
sane asylum now.”  
I began to laugh.  
at me and said : :  
“If you laugh any more I will put you in  
the cellar, and feed you on bread and water  
for a week.”  
  
This not being a pleasant prospect, I sub-  
sided. °  
  
“You are a precious woman to clean house,”  
continued she. “# should have thought a  
child would know better than to commence  
to clean right in the middle of the Louse.  
You should commence in the attis and go  
lown. Don’t you know that after you get  
through with the down stairs the dirt from  
the attic will make it all dirtier than ever ?”  
  
“I never thought of that,” I answered,  
meekly. .  
  
“ And then to begin when it’s cold enough  
to freeze. It’s a wonder you didn’t have the  
lung fever, or something worse,” went on  
Aunt  
  
“I must get up and clean the attic,” I  
said.  
  
“No, you won&#x27;t,” said Aunt Thankful,  
“ for I g@eaned it myself.”  
  
“ Weill, there are the rest of the carpets  
to put down.”  
  
Aunt Thankful glared  
  
« All hung.”  
  
I gave a sigh of relief.

Chaokful! She had accomplished  
lay what it would have taken me a  
gerform ; but then I never could  
like Aunt Thankful; she seems to be made  
of wire. I have lesrned since then to take  
Aunt Thankful’s advice, never to commence  
cleaning until the weather is ‘warm, and  
never to commence at the wrong end of the  
  
house.  
But it was such a mortification to think  
that my new plan was a total failure.

1; V WITCH HAZEL  
Every year I endeavor to make some  
improvement in my method of house  
cleaning. This spring, I made up my  
mind to adhere no longer to the poky  
old plan of my grandmother? which was  
to begin in the attic, and wind up in the  
ocnar ? but determined to strike out io  
another directibn ; and so, while the  
subject was rife in my mind, I set about  
executing my new projects at once, al­  
though it wa? but the first of April, and  
&#x27;he weather quite chilly and raw. In  
the tirnt place, I bad every Hove moved  
out, then every carpet taken up. all the  
pictures removed from the walls, the  
curtains down, everything piled out on  
the back porch, and the carpetless balk  
crammed to overflowing with books,  
chair*, leather-dusters, vases hair-mat­  
treses, parian brackets, and pillowsj  
and while everything was in the wildest  
confusion. Frank came in with distended  
eyes.  
&quot;What on farth in hII this. Hattie?  
be exclaimed.  
&quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing in  
my efiorts to rea:h a swaying cobweb,  
&quot;we have commenced cleaning house,  
and I lowered my broom, and looked  
straight in his face to see if he fully  
realized the importance of these words ;  
but to my chagrin, he looked utterly in­  
different, and brushing off some stray  
cobwelie which bad floated down from  
the ceiling f&gt;n to his coat-sleeve, a^ked  
impatiently, &quot;Isn&#x27;t dinner ready?&quot;  
&quot;Dinner!&quot; I cried ; &quot;1 bad no idea it  
was so late. I have n&#x27;t even com­  
menced dinner yet.  
? Pretty state of affairs,&quot; grumble]  
Frank. &quot;1 brought Ed. Graham home  
with me.&quot;  
?Where is be?&quot; 1 asked faintly.  
In the parlor,&quot; replied Frank, crust­  
ilv. The floor is bare; there isn&#x27;t a  
chair or any thing else lor the man to  
sit on 1 expect I&#x27;ll find him seated on  
the piano. But come, llattie,&#x27; he add­  
ed, &quot;what are you going to give us to  
eat ?&quot;  
&quot;O, Frank,&quot; I said, coaxingly, think­  
ing of my rough hair and the grease  
spot on my dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your  
dinner down-town to-day ?&#x27;  
Frank looked cross, and said he sup­  
posed he could, and went down to the  
parlor. 1 leaned over the banister, and  
when Frank opened the door, caught a  
&quot;limpse of Ed. roaming around the  
desolate room, shivering, with his hands  
in his pockets. 1 watched them go  
through the hall, and heard Frank  
making some hateful remark about  
women and house cleaning. He slam­  
med the door violently, anil I serenely  
resumed my sweeping, not in the least  
disturbed by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed an­  
novance anil provoking manner, rran ?  
was always a little unreasonable ; and  
he was always bringing somebody home  
to dinner wlien I least expected it.  
Just then, little Ted came toddling in,  
and wanted to help. As I was about to  
make a change of base, I took mm  
with me down to the parlor, gave him  
a rag and a basin of water, and told him  
he might clean the floor. He sat down  
in one corner of the room, and with a  
face most unearthly, at once commenced  
a vigerous scrubbing. Norah was up­  
stairs, washing wincows in the front  
chamber. Suddenly there came aloud  
crash followed by a terrible yell ; it  
sounded as if the whole house was  
tumbling down. &quot;Heaven. 1 ex­  
claimed, &quot;what can have happened.  
1 mounted the stairs, two steps at a time  
and there beheld Norah lying full  
length ou the floor, amidst a debris of  
broken step-ladder, pieces of glass, and  
soapsuds. ,  
&quot;What is the matter? 1 cried to the  
o?roaning girl. . , , , ,  
&quot;Shure, mum, I fell off the the ladder  
agin the windy, an cut myself most  
awful,&quot; moaned Norah.  
1 helped the heavy girl to arise,  
bound up her lacerated arm, left her to  
pick up the fragments of glass and  
wood, and returned to the parlor, there  
to find Ted scouring the piano-legs with  
the scrubbing-brush. 1 quickly re­  
lieved him from all further labor, bun­  
dled him up, and sent him out into the  
vard to play.  
&quot;Faith, mum,&quot; said Norah, standing  
in the door, &quot;1 feel so faint, an&#x27; if I don t  
be takiu&#x27; something ?lrong I cant  
work no more to-day.&quot;  
&quot;Then make your-elf some tea, l  
reV,ut Norah disdainfully said, &quot;.Shure  
1 never could stomach tajr; the very  
smell of it makes me sick. . ? ,  
&quot;Well, then, take some brandy, i  
replied. Now, I ought to have known  
better than to allow Norah to help her­  
self to the brandy, but Wing in such a  
hurrv to finish the parlor I could not  
conveniently stop. When I had occasion  
to go through the hall again, I paused  
and listened ; I could hear nothing of  
i Norah moving about, so once more I  
mounted the stairs. There, in the mid­  
dle of the room, she sat in a rockyig­  
chair, a bucket of water stood before her,  
while she swayed lazily back and forth  
! with the mop in her hand, wihch left a  
! long trail dirty of water behind it  
| &#x27; Norah !&quot; I cried, &quot;didn&#x27;t I tell you  
1 to mop this floor?&quot;  
&quot;Faith, mum, and I&#x27;m doin&#x27; it as fast  
as I can,&#x27; she replied.  
&quot;How can you mop sitting down ?&quot;

1 against the wall.

.-W?*a About to descend th* stairs,  
*W tiM*M&gt;d dirty,&#x27; J heard Prank call­  
&quot;Ilattie! Ilattie! where in the  
world are you 7&#x27;  
&quot;Here,&quot; I replied.  
Frank came up the uncarted stairs  
; aud stumbled over the mop. , &quot;Confound  
It T he cried, &quot;why ie this kpuae^ulark  
? tgypl T Weir  
we to go supperless as well as dinner­  
leee ?  
&#x27; fhere is no fire made, I taid, &quot;and  
Norah is drunk, and I am tired to death;  
and? and ? &quot; here I burst into tears,  
and sat down on the wet floor.  
&#x27;Why, Ilattie! Hattie! what are  
you crying about ? I&#x27;ll make the tire ;  
never mind about supper; had a capi­  
tal dinner down town ; comedown stairs  
out of this damp room.&quot; And Frank,  
who always got good and sorry the  
moment after he was cross, helped me  
up off the floor, and down stairs into  
the kitchen. &quot;Now don&#x27;t cry any  
more,&quot; he said, wiping my tear-bedewed  
cheeks with his handkerchief; &quot;sit  
down, and 1 11 have a fire in two min­  
utes.&quot;  
&quot;Where&#x27;s Ted ?&quot; he inquired, pausing  
for breath between the vigorous nutfs at  
the fire.  
&quot;1 haven&#x27;t Seen him all the after­  
noon. I sent him out to play and he  
hasn&#x27;t been in the house since,&quot; I re­  
plied.  
Frank dropped the shavings and  
started out in search of him. I waited  
and waited, and shivered with the cold,  
but no Frank came. I sat in the stifl­  
backed chair and closed my eyes. The  
last thing I remembered was a violent  
not! which prettv nearly dislocated my  
neck.  
&quot;Hattie!&quot; [ awoke with a start.  
Frank was shaking me.  
&quot;You will take your death of cold;  
you have been fast asleep.&quot;  
&quot;Where was Ted? did you find him  
in the cistern ?&#x27;&#x27; I asked dreamily.  
&quot;No, &#x27;, laughed Frank, &quot;but &quot; just  
about as bad; the j&gt;Or fellow was in  
the coal-cellar, asleep like his mother.&#x27;&#x27;  
I rubbed my eves and looked at the  
child ; he was covered with coal-duet  
from his head to his feet, and as black  
as a negro. Frank prepared supper  
while I washed Ted&#x27;s face and hands.  
&quot;How can you finish your cleaning  
without Norah f he inquired.  
&quot;I am sure I don&#x27;t flee how 1 can,&#x27;&#x27; 1  
replied, as the mountains of work arose  
in my troubled mind. &quot;Norah must be  
sent away in the morning.&quot;  
We all ate heartily of our supper,  
notwithstanding the &quot;eggs were trie !  
until they were so crisp and brittle that  
they broke into bits if you so much as  
looked at them, and the&quot; toast was burnt,  
and the coffee not half boiled; still, as  
I was ravenously hungry, it all tasted  
pretty good. Alter we had cleared the j  
table and piled the dishes awav to be  
willed in the morning, we retired, anil  
being so fatigued I did not awaken until  
a late hour in the morning Norah  
was dismissed, Frank went to hisotlice,  
and I to my cleaning. Frank had the  
carpeta shaken, and the parlor tloor  
being dry, 1 soon had it all tacked down;  
then moved the chairs in, and began to  
dust the mantel ornaments, but, O hor­  
ror! I let fall one of my loveliest vases  
and shivered it into a thousand frag­  
ments. A very bad beginning of the  
day, I thought sorrowfully, picking up  
the pieces.  
&quot;Mamma, &#x27; cried a shrill voice, &quot;Is  
all jess up.&quot;  
&quot;Where are you, Ted?&quot; I called  
&quot;Here,&#x27;&#x27; cried Ted.  
&quot;And where is &#x27;here&#x27; ; you&#x27;re in so ne  
mischief, I&#x27;ll be bound.&#x27;  
I heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, ami a  
great scrambling up the attic stairs.  
Atter 1 had thrown the shattered pieces  
of my vase away, I ran up stairs to see  
what he was doing. What a sight met  
my eyes! Ted was arrayed in my vio­  
let silk, pinned up in front, and trailing  
far behind on the tloor, my white lace  
shawl around his shoulders, and my  
best bonnet on his head. I stood trans­  
fixed for a moment, while Ted went  
prancing round and round in the dust  
and dirt of the attic; then I started after  
him. Of course he ran, screaming and  
laughing. &quot;Take care !&quot; I cried, but  
too late; he fell from the top to the bot­  
tom of the stairs.  
Rip, rip, went my violet silk , bump,  
bump, went Ted. &quot; I flew down after  
him with my heart in my mouth, and  
picked up a little insensible heap of  
lace, ribbons, silk, and dirt. That fall  
saved Ted a good whipping. 1 carried  
him down stairs, and sprinkled him pro­  
fusely with water, camphor, and eau&#x27;d*­  
colonge , until he opened his eyes; then I  
examined my ruined clothes.&quot; My dress  
was a mass of grease, cobwebs, and  
dust; the front width was wretchedly  
torn with the pins; my shawl and bon­  
net were crushcJ and torn. I put them  
all away with a sigh of regret, and  
turned my attention once more to the j  
perpetrator of this terrible deed. Just  
then some one knooked at the hack &#x27;  
tloor. On opening it, I tound a stout&#x27;  
German girl on the step; she talked so1  
broken that I could ecracelv understand |  
her, but managed to comprehend enough  
to know that Frank had engaged her  
for me. I set her to work immediately !  
to clean the china closet, and returned !  
to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I  
heard a terrible crash in the dining­  
room. &quot;Heavens!&quot; I exclaimed; &quot;what  
can have happened now f and rushing  
out I found the frightened girl clasping  
and unclasping her hands in a heart­  
rending manner. No wonder. -S.&#x27;ie  
had npset the table on which all my  
sbiuing glass and china was placed.  
Every thing was literally smashed K&gt;  
i)iec-?s. My beautiful celery glasses !  
My goblets and tea-set ! My fruit  
6tands! Was there ever such a poor  
afflicted mortal as I ? Words fail me  
to express my feelings at that moment.  
I sat down, perfectly stunned, to witness  
the harrowing sight of all my superb  
dishes swept away.  
There came another knock at the  
door. This time an Irish girl made  
her appearance. I wondered if Frank  
intended to send a regiment to destroy  
my house. However, I took her in,  
and the first thing I told her to do was  
to answer the door-bell, which had rung  
twice. I peeped through the door, which  
was partly open, an! saw two ladies,  
but could not distinguish who they  
were.  
&quot;Mum. there is two witnmen as wants  
to see yez,&quot; said Ann, giving the door  
a violent push against my head.  
&quot;Go tell them to excuse me,&quot; I said :  
and being very dizzy from the blow, I  
failed to notice that Ann, in her stupid­  
ity, had left the sitting-room door wide  
open, and as the ladies cams out of the  
parlor, they saw me plainly.  
&quot;0 mortifiaation ! &#x27; I &quot;was all rags  
and dirt, btrt had become somewhat  
reconciled to my misfortunes by this  
time.  
Whea Frank came up to sapper the  
  
hall was ***7 ditff&#x27;Ann B ,

and swore; said he would rather U m

There lay my fl*hon the carpet, to sav  
nothing of the water. I belie* e I shook  
or slapped tHfe girl, 1 don t rej member  
which. Ann was so astonished at see­  
ing me fly into such a passion , that sne  
backed up against the window and  
thrust her clumsy foot through my lace  
curtain. This was the grand finale. I  
burst into tears, and ?&gt;did Ann .  
hearing the sobs, came running in, , and  
not knowing what to make of it. jomaj  
in and swelled the chorus. Amidst one  
of our longest and loudest wails, the

I made 110 reply, but sobbed hcedlet

awful vdfte. &quot;Answer me immedia.ely.  
What is the matter?&#x27;&#x27;

! Aunt Thankful put on her spectacle*,  
| sat down on the floor and examined iL  
&quot;Silly puss,&quot; she mumbled. I &lt; ?n &#x27;&gt;arn  
that in ten minutes.&quot; # ? .  
&quot;Yes, with blue stocking yarn,  
said, and began to laugh sarcastically,  
anil then 1 laughed. Ann  
Ted laughed. Poor Aunt Thankful  
stared at us in horror and said:  
&quot;(iood Heavens&#x27; they are all *&#x27;*rk  
mad and jumping up off the floor  
she seized mv arm and dragged me into  
the bed-room, and put me to bed, then  
went out and locked the door, and left  
me alone. I went to sleep. When  
awoke Aunt Thankful was sittingjby  
mv bed sewing. . &#x27; .  
&quot;Aunt Thankful, I *aid, when did  
vou come?&quot; .... ?? ?  
&quot;Yesterday morning, she replied.  
&quot;What time is it now .&#x27; 1 inquired.  
&quot;Three o&#x27;clock.&#x27; nnswerel Aunt  
Thankful. . , . ,  
&quot;1 have slept several hours, then, i  
said. &quot;Was 1 asleep when you came  
&quot;I should rather think not; when 1  
came vou were crazy, and 1 put you to  
be?l. Vou slept all the rest of the day  
and night until this blessed minute, and 1  
if vou hadn&#x27;t been put to bed you  
would have been in the insane asylum  
now. , . . .  
1 began to laugh. Aunt Ihankiui  
glared at me and said  
&quot;If you laugh any more 1 will put you  
in the cellar, and feed you on bread and  
water for a week. &#x27;  
This not heing a pleasant prospect 1  
subsided.  
&quot;You are a precious woman to clean  
house,&quot; continued she. &quot;1 should have  
thought a child would know better than  
to commence to clean right in the mid­  
dle of the house. You should com­  
mence in the attic and go down. Don t  
vou know that after you get through  
with the down stairs the dirt from the  
attic will made it all dirtier than ever?&#x27;&#x27;  
&quot;I never thought of that,&quot; I answered,  
meekly. . . . . .  
&quot;And then to begin when its cold  
enough to freeze. It&#x27;s a wonder you  
didn t have the lung lever, or something  
worse,&quot; went on Aunt Thankful. ^ (  
&quot;1 must get up and clean the attic,  
&quot;No you won&#x27;t,&#x27; said Aunt Thankful,  
&quot;for I cleaned it myself.&quot;  
&quot;Well, there are the rest of the car­  
pets to put down.  
&quot;They&#x27;re all down.&quot;  
&quot;And the pictures.&#x27;  
? &quot;All hung.&quot;  
I gave a great sigh of relief. W hat  
would 1 have done if it had not beeu  
for Aunt Thankful! She had accom­  
plished in one day what it would have  
taken me a week to perform ; l?ut then  
1 never could bob around like Aunt  
Thankful ; she seems to he made of wire.  
I have learned since then to take Aunt  
Thankful s advice, never to commcnce  
cleaning until the weather is warm, and  
never to commence at the wrong end of  
the house.  
But it was such a mortification to  
think that my new plan was a total  
failure

SBY WITCH HAZEL.  
(From the Home Journal.J  
Every year I endeavor to make some im­  
&#x27; prove ment in my method of house-cleaning.  
S&#x27;This spring. I made up my mind to adhere  
, no longer to the poky old plan of my grand­  
mo&#x27;ther-wh}h was. to begin in the attic.  
. nd wind up in the cellar-but determined  
to strike out in another direction; and so,  
whiile the subject was rife in my mind, I set  
about executing my new projects at once,  
a although it was but the first of April, and the  
weather quite chilly and raw, In the first  
I plice, I had every stove moved out, then  
every carpet taken up, all the pictures re­  
moved from the walls, the curtains down,  
everything piled out on the back porch,  
and the carpetless balls crammpd to over­  
tlowhi with bos i statues, feather­  
ets and pillows ; and whire everyting was  
in the wildest confusion, Frank came in  
with distended eyes.  
&#x27;What on earth is all, this, Hattie ?&quot; he  
exclaimed.  
&quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing in my  
efforts to re.ach a swaying cobweb. &quot;we  
have commenced cleaning house,&quot; and I  
lowered my broon, and looke I straght in  
his fa;r&#x27;e to see if he fully realized the imn­  
poIranuce of thlese words ; but to my cha­  
grin, he loaoked utterly indiffe-rent, and  
brushing off some stray cobwebs which had  
. flouted downa from the ceailing on to his cot­  
slheeve, iaakd implatiently, &#x27;Is ;n&#x27;t dinner  
ready ?&quot; &quot;Dl)ier!&#x27;&quot; I cried; &quot;*I had no ii  
idea it nitas .o late. I have n&#x27;t even com- a  
mencd di.nner yet.&#x27;&quot; h  
&quot;lPretty state of affairs,&quot; grumbled  
Frank, &quot;I brought Ed. Graham home with  
me.&quot; d  
&quot;Where is he ?&quot; I asked, faintly.  
•&quot;In the parlor,&quot; replied Frank. crustily. a  
&quot;The floor is bare; there is n&#x27;t a chair or  
anything else for the tan to sit on. I ex- 01  
pect I&#x27;ll find him seated on the piano. But  
come, Hattie,&quot; he&#x27; added, &quot;what are you I  
going to give us to eatt&quot; P&#x27;  
&quot;O, Frank,&quot; I said, coaxingly, thinking d  
of my rough hair and the grease-spot on  
my dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your ditner down- st  
town to day ?&quot;&#x27;  
Frank looked cross, and said he supposed  
he could, and went down to tht parlor. I  
leaned over the banister, and thea Frank je  
opened the door, caught a glimpse of Ed.  
roaming around the desolate rdºm, shiver­  
ing, with his hands in his pockets. I  
watched them go through the hall, and mi  
heard Frank making some hatsful remarks  
about women and house-chasing. He r  
slammed the door violently, an] I serenely II  
resumed my sweeping, not in the least dis- as  
turbed by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed annoyance do  
and provoking manner. Frank was always we  
a little -unreasonable , and he was alwayi fr  
bringing somebody home to dianer when I -m  
least expected it. an  
Just then, little Ted came toddling in, ta  
and wanted to help. As I vas about to pr  
make a change of base, I took Jim with me dii  
down to the pal.r, gave hima rag and a Of  
basin of water, and told him he  
the room. and with a ace o os umear y  
solemnity, at once commencel a vigorous bu  
scrubbing. Norah was up stairs, washing wi  
windows in the front chambeo. Suddenly a  
there came a loud crash, followed by a t or- sil  
riSc yell; it sounded as if the whole house go  
was tumbling down. &quot;Heawuns!&quot; I ex- a  
claimed, &quot;what can have happened.&quot; I c  
mounted the stairs, two steps ¢ atime, and op  
there beheld Norah lying fall ength on the ila  
floor, amidst a debris of broker step-ladder, gr  
pieces of glass, and soapsuds.&#x27; e  
&quot;What is the matter ?&quot; I cried to the se  
  
}growaning girl. . I  
,&quot;Shure, I.a, I fell of it ladder agin t  
the windy, an&#x27; out myseelftost awful,&quot; p  
moaned Norah.  
I helped the heavy girl t arise, bound q  
up her ,lacerated arm, left ir to pick up t  
the fragments of ghss and rood, and re- a  
turned to the parlor, thenr to find Ted e  
scoring the piano-legs with the scrubbing- I  
brash. I quickly relieved hinfrom all fur- Ii  
ther labor, bundled him upsed sent him r  
out in the yard to play. b  
,-Faith, mum,&quot; said Norua. standlng in  
the door, &quot;*I feel so faint, at if I don&#x27;t be b  
tnkin somethin&#x27; strong I cat&#x27;t work no more t  
to-day.&quot; b  
,*Then make yourself some tea,&quot; I re­  
plied. a  
But Norah disdainfully id. &quot;Shure I I  
never could stomach tay; the very smill of I  
it makes mo sick,&quot;  
&#x27;Well. then, take some Imady,&quot; I re­  
plied. Now, I ought to have knowu better  
than to allow Norab to hei herselfto the  
brandy, but being in such a hurry to fish a  
the parlor I could not coaveietly atop. a  
When I had occasion to go through the  
tall again, I passed and listened ; I could  
bear nothing of Norah moving about, so  
once mere I mounted the stairs. There, in  
the middle of the room, she sat in a rock­  
ing-chair, a bucket of water stood before  
her, while she swayed lazily back and forth  
with the mop in her hand, which left a long  
trail of diity water behind it.  
&quot;Norah!&quot; I cried, &quot;did n&#x27;t I tell you to  
mop t oor t I ,_  
Si.How eaTS a&#x27; mIOsitallj dew.&quot; I  
asked indignantly.  
&quot; Share, I&#x27;m so tired, I thbeght I could

*g right up out of that dhalir.&quot; I said.

&quot;Where&#x27;s Ted&#x27;&#x27;&quot; Iw inquired, ipaging for  
breath between the vigorous puttls a.t ith  
fire.  
[&quot;I have n&#x27;t seen hi, ail th,* aftmern,&quot;  
I sent him out toi pily and hi, haI n&#x27;t Ibie  
in the house since.&quot; I replied.  
Frank dropped the shaviIng, and 1tart.ed  
out in search of him. 1 waited and waited.  
and shivered with the cold, lbut tno l&quot;ratk  
came. I sat in the stiff-backed chair alit  
closed my eyes. The last tlhing I ren&#x27;ii.i­  
bered was a violent anid which lpretty iearly  
dislocated my neck.  
&quot;Hattie !&quot; I awoke with a start. Frank  
was shaking me.  
&quot;You will take your denath of cold: mi  
have been fast asleep.&quot;  
&quot;Where was Ted ? did you lind hlim in  
the cistern ?&quot; I asked drea.iily.  
&quot;eNo&quot; u F i, &quot;&#x27;bLt ju.st bout at,  
Sasleep like hisartot 14)r.&quot; -  
I rubbed my oyss and looked at fithe child ;  
he was covered with coal-dust from iti.,  
head to his feet, and was as black us a n i,­  
gro. Frank prepared supper whii I  
washed Ted&#x27;s face and hands.  
&quot;How can you finish your clh&#x27;aing. with  
out Norah ?&quot; he inquired.  
&quot;I am sure I do n&#x27;t :ee htow I ca&#x27;i.&quot; I  
replied, as the mIountain of work arose in I  
my troubled mind. &quot;&#x27;Norah must lit&#x27; sent1  
away in the morning.&quot;  
We all ate heartily of our supper, nittt  
withstanding the eggs were fried until thue  
were so crisp and brittle that thyv hrket ,  
into bits if you so much as lot.ked at tlihen,  
and the toast was burnt, and the colflte t it  
half boiled. still, as I was ravenously huin­  
gry, it all tasted pretty good. After we  
had cleared the tabe&#x27; and piled the a  
dishes away to be washed in the morning.  
we retired, and being so fatigued I did not ti  
awaken until a late hour in the morning. f,  
Norah was dismissed, Frank went to his  
office, and I to my cleaning. Frank lvad si  
the carpets shaken, and the parlor floor be­  
ing dry, I soon had it all tacked down ; i  
then moved the chairs in, and began to tl  
dust the mantel ornaments, but, 0 horror! ci  
I let fall one of my loveliest vases and tl  
shivered it into a thousand fragments. A ait  
very bad beginning of the day, I thoulght at  
sorowfully, picking up the pieces. tl  
&quot;Mamma,&quot; cried a shrill voice, &quot;I&#x27;s all i,  
jess up.&quot;  
&quot;Where are you, Ted ?&quot; I called. m  
.&quot;Here,&quot; cried Ted.  
&quot;And where is here; you&#x27;re inlsome t,,  
mischief, 141 be bound.&quot; &quot;t  
  
I heard Ted&#x27;s bhuckling laugh, and a 0  
great scrambling up the attic stairs After  
I had thrown the shatterd pieces of my vase.  
away, I ran up stairs to see what he was  
doing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted &#x27;1  
was arrayed in my violet silk. pinned up in  
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, t4  
*my white lace shawl around his shoulders,  
and my best bonnet on his head. I stood  
transfixed for a moment, while Ted went  
prancing round and round in the dust an I  
dirt of the attic; then I started after him. W  
Of course he&#x27;ran, scrdaming and laughing. A  
p, rap, went my violet sl; bump,,  
bump, went Ted. I flew down after him  
with my heart in my mouth, and picked up  
a little insensible heap of lace, ribbons,  
silk, and dirt. - That fall saved Ted from a w  
good whipping, I carried him down stairs.  
and sprinkled him profusely with water,  
camphor, and eas-de-cologne, until he  
opened his eyes; then I examined my ru­  
ined clothes. My dress was a mass of  
grease, cobwebs, and dust; the front width  
was wretchedly torn with the pins; my  
shawl and bonnet were crashed and torn.  
I put them away with a sigh of grgret. and  
turned my attention once more to the per­  
petrator of this terrible deed. Just then  
some one kbcked at the back door. On i  
opeaing it. Lfound a stout German girlpn 1  
the step ; she talked so broken that I could  
scarcely understand her, but managed to  
oprebend enough to know that Frank. t  
had engaged her for me. I set her to work  
immediately to clean the china closet, and  
returned to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I  
heard a terrible crash in the dinning-room.  
*Heavena !&#x27;&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;what can have  
happened now t?&quot; and rushing out I found  
the frightened girl clasping and unclasping  
her hands iua heart-rending m.anner. No  
wonder. She had upset the table on which  
all my shining glass and china was placed.  
Everything waslitesrally amashed to pieces.  
My beautiful elergy glasses. My goblet-,  
and tea-set! My fruitstands! Was there  
ever suck a poor afflicted&quot; mortal as I ?  
Words fail_ me to express my feelings at  
that moment. I sat down, perfectly stut­  
at ed, to witness the harrowing sight of all  
my suaerb dishes swept away.  
There came another knock at the door.  
Thistihme s.irish girl made her appearance.  
I wtndted if Frank intended to send a  
regiment to destroy my house. However,  
I tOok her in, and the Mrst thing I told her  
to do was to answer the door=bell. which  
bad rang &#x27;twioe. I peeped through the  
door, which was par.ly open, and saw ladies,  
but could not distinguish who they were.  
&#x27; &quot;ium, there is two wimmen as wants to  
see yea,&quot;said A i, ving the door a vi­  
,&#x27; t. uai to0 4O. ine .- i,  
and being very - dizzy fium the blow, I  
failed to notie that Ann, in.her stupidity,  
had left the sitting-room door open, and as  
the ladies came out of the parlor, tlhey atw  
,t ý &quot; mortifiation !&quot; I was all rags and  
, dirt, but had become somewhat reconciled  
I to my .mbforte by this time.  
When FrM ame up to suppert the hall  
was very dark; Ann was putting down the  
doer-mat. Frank forgot all about the new  
serve$t, and in the darkness mistook the  
a beri Irish girl for me, and kissed her.  
mlllaImsd and rasamnd fell over a chair,  
F ak tore round and swore; said he would  
rather be In bedlam than where a wdman  
was cleaning boase&#x27; wondered why I  
coild n&#x27;t haib the lall lighted. To all this  
SI made no reply, but smiled grimly. Be­

ir g. This sprin.  
a&#x27;aaere no longer  
I made up my mind to  
o the r.okv old plan of  
my grandmother which was to begin in  
the attic, and wind up in the cellar but  
determined to strike out in another direc­  
tion : and so. while the subject was ri.&#x27;e  
in my ui&#x27;nl, I set about executing; my new  
plan at once although it was but the first  
of April, and the weather .puite chilly and  
raw. In the first place. 1 had every stcve  
moved out, then e very carpet taken up. all  
the pictures removed irorn the walls, the  
curtains down, everything piled out cn tbe  
bact porch, and the carpetie.-s ha::­  
crammed to overSowing with book, chair-,  
statues, leather dusters, vase?, hair mat­  
tresses, parian brackets, and pillows ; an 1  
whil everything was in the wildest con­  
fusion, Frank came in with distended  
eyes.  
What on earth is .-ill this. Hattie he  
exclaimed.  
1 Why. Frank,&#x27; I replied, pausing in my

have otnmericed cleaning he use.&quot; and I  
lowered my broom, and looked straight in  
his face to see if he fully realized the im­  
portance of these word- : but to my cha­  
grin, he looked utterly in i 8&#x27;ersnt. and  
bru.-h in cS some stray cobweb which  
had floated down from the ceiiiDg.cn to  
h;- coat sleeve, asked impatiently, Isn&#x27;t

mantle ornaments, but, U horror 1 I let  
fall one cf my loveliest va-es and shivered  
it into a thousand fragments. A very  
bad beginning of&#x27; the dav, I thought sor-  
rowf&#x27;ully, picking up the pieces.  
&#x27; Mamma,&quot; cried a .-hrii! voice,  
Fs all

&#x27; And where is here  
vou re in so.:,e  
mischief I&#x27;ll be boun-s.  
1 neara jeu s enucsnng  
laugh, and a  
great scrambling up the attic stair  
After 1 had thrown the shattered p ieces  
of my vase away, l ran up stairs to see  
what he was doing. What a sight met my  
eyes ? Ted wes arrayed tn my violet silk,  
pinned up in frcrt, and trailing far beb&#x27;nd  
on the floor, my white lace !-bawl around  
his shoulders, and my best bonnet on his  
head. 1 steed transfixed for a moment,  
while Ted went pranr.ng round and round  
in the dust aDd dirt ol the attic; then I  
started after him. Of ccurse he ran.  
sceraming and laughing. &#x27; Take care. 1  
cried,&quot; but tco late ; he fell from the  
top to the bottom of the stairs.  
Hip, rip, went my violet silk; bump.  
dirt.  
That Jail saved Ted from a good  
whippiDg. I carried him down stair?, and  
tprinkled him profusely with water, and  
camphor, until he opened his eyes ; then I  
examined my ruined clothes, My dress  
. was a mass of cobwebs, grease, and dust ;  
; the front width was wretchedly torn with  
j  
!P; my hawl and Wnet were crushed  
j and torn. I put them a,l away with a  
  
  
sigh of regret, and turned my attention  
once more to the prepetrator of this terri­  
ble deed. Just then some one knocked at  
the back door. (Ju opening it I found a  
a stout German g rl on the step ; she  
talked so broken that 1 could scarcely un­  
derstand her, but managed to comprehend  
enough to know that Frank had engaged  
her for me, I set her to work immediate­  
ly to clean the china closet, and returned  
to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I heard a  
terrible crash in the dining room. Hea­  
vens 1&#x27; 1 exclaimed ; &#x27;what can have hap­  
pened noic&#x27;f and rushing out 1 found the  
frightened girl clasping and unclasping her  
hands iu a heart rending manner. No won­  
der. She had upset the table on which  
all my shining glass and china was placed.  
Kvery thing was literally siaa.hed to pieces.  
My beautiful celery glasses! My goblets,  
and tea set ! My fruit stands ! Was  
there ever such a peer uliilcted mortal as  
I &#x27;.&#x27; Words fail n.e to express my leelings  
at that moment. I sat down, perfectly  
stunned, to witness the harrowing sight  
of all my superb dishes swept away.  
There came another knock at the door.  
This time an Irish girl made her appear­  
ance. 1 wonder if F&#x27;ranV intended to send  
a regiment to destroy my house. How­  
ever, 1 took her iD, and the first thing 1  
told her to do was answer the door bell,  
which had rung twice. I peeped through  
the door, which was partly op en, and saw  
two ladies, but could not distinguish who  
they were.  
Mum, tncre are two wtmiuvn as want­  
to see ye,&#x27; sa.d Ann. giving the door a  
violent jej-h against my head.  
&#x27; Go tell thctn to excuse u.e.&quot; I said :  
ar.d Icing very d zzy from the blow. I did  
hot notice that Ann. in her stup idity, Lad  
  
It th  
e sitting room door cjtn.  
and a  
the ;aa;es came out 1 1 the par. or they .-aw  
n.e &#x27;amly.  
U u.crt noation !&#x27; 1 was all rag,- and  
d:rt. but had become somewhat reconciled  
to my misfortunes by this time.  
htti Frank came heme to supp er, the  
ball was very dark ; Ann was p utting dow n  
lew servant, and in the darkness m  
tuok  
the Loi rid girl tor me. and ki--td her.  
Ann -! a tned and rati, and fell over a  
chair. Frank tore nund and .-wore :  
sa d he Wiuld rather Le ;.u bedlam than  
where a Wi.man wa- clean tg hci.se : wtn­  
dered why 1 couldli t have the hall lighted.

Aunt Thankful.&quot; I -aid. when did you

Was I a-ieep when y ou came ? &#x27;  
1 should rather tfiink not ; when I

You s.tp t all the rc.-t o! the day and night

been p.ut to bed you would have been ia  
the insane a-ylum now.&quot;  
1 began to laugh. Aunt &#x27;Thankful glared  
at me and said :  
If you laugh any more 1 will put you  
into the cellar, and feed you on bread and  
water for a week.&quot;  
This not being a pleasant prosp ect. I sub­  
sided.You ire a pTccious woman to clean  
house.&#x27; continued she. 1 should have  
thought a child would know better than to  
commence in the attic and go down. Don&#x27;t  
vou know that after you get through with  
the down stairs the dirt from the attid will  
make it dirtier than ever &#x27;.&#x27; &#x27;  
I never thougat of that,&quot; 1 answered .  
meekly.  
&#x27; And then to begin w Leu it&#x27;s cold enough  
to freeze. It&#x27;s a wonder you didu&#x27;t have  
the lung fever, or something worse,&quot; went  
on Aunt Thankful.  
I must get up and cleau the attic.&quot; I  
said.  
No you won&#x27;t,&quot; said Aunt Thankful,  
for I c. caned il myself.&quot;  
Weil, there are the rj.-t of the carpets  
to put down.&#x27;  
They&#x27;re ali down.&#x27;  
And the pictures.&#x27;  
&#x27; All hung.&#x27;  
I gave a great sigh of relief. What  
would 1 have done if it had not been for  
Aunt Thankful ! She had accomplished in  
one day what it would have taken mo a  
week t perform ; but then I never could  
bob round like Aunt Thankful ; she seems  
to be made of wire. I have learned since  
then to take Aunt Thankfu&#x27;&quot;s advice, never  
to commence cleaning until the weather is  
warm, and never to commence at the wrong  
end of the house.  
But it was such a mortification to think  
that my new plan was a total failure.  
lharth and lkrmt.

nv WI1CI1 HAZEL.  
Every j-cir I endeavor to nitikoKomo Im­  
provement in my mellioil of house clean­  
ing. This sprlnp, I mailo up my mind to  
ndlierc no longer to the poky old plnn of  
my grandmother which was to hegln In  
tho nttlc, and wind up In the cellar but  
determined to striko out In another direc­  
tion j ami so, while the subject was rlfo In  
my uilnd, I set about executing my new  
projects at once, although it was hut tho  
liri.t or April, and the weather quite chilly  
and raw. In tho first place I had every  
stove, nioxcd out, then overy carpot taken  
up, all tho pictures removed from the walls,  
tho curtains down, everything piled out In  
tho back porch, and tho carpctless halls  
eramnjed to overflowing with books,  
( halts, statues, feather-dusters, vases, hair  
luatrcstes, parian brackets, and plllous;  
aud whllo everything was In tho wildest  
confusion, Prank camo In with distended  
eyes.  
&quot;What on earth Is all this, Ilattle?&quot; ho  
exclaimed.  
&quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing In my  
efforts to reach a swaying cobweb, &quot;wo  
have commenced to clean ;houso ;&quot; and I  
lowered my broom, and looked ntraight  
Into his face to sco If ho realized tho Im­  
portance of theso words j but to my cha­  
grin he looked utterly Indifferent; and  
brushing off somo stray cobwebs which  
had floated down from the celling on to his  
coat sleovc, asked Impatiently, &quot;Isn&#x27;t din­  
ner ready?&quot;  
&quot;Dinner!&quot; I cried; &quot;I had no Idea it  
was so late. I bavn&#x27;t even commenced  
dinner yet.&quot;  
&quot;Pretty statoofaffalrs,&quot;grumhlcd Frank.  
&quot;I brought Ed Oraham homo with me.&quot;  
&quot;Where is ho?&quot; I asked faintly.  
&quot;In tho parlor,&quot; replied Frank crustily.  
&quot;Tho floor Is baro ; and there Isn&#x27;t a chair  
or anything clso for tho man to sit on. I  
oxpect I&#x27;ll find him seated ou the piano.  
Hut come, Ilattla,&quot; ho added, &quot;what arc  
you going to give us to cat T&quot;  
&quot;O, Frank,&quot; I said coaxlngly, thinking  
of my rough hair, aud tho groasespoton  
my dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your dlnnerdown  
town today?&quot;  
Frank looked cross, and said he suppos­  
ed ho could, and went down to the parlor.  
I leaned over tho baluster, and when  
Frank opened tho door, caught a glimpse  
of Ed roaming around tho desolate room,  
shivering with his hands In his pockets. I  
watched them go through tho hall, and  
beard Frank mako somo hateful remarks  
about .women and houso-cleanlng, llo  
slammed tho door violently, and I sereno­  
ly resumed my sweeping not in tho least  
dlstrubed by Frank&#x27;s uncoucealed annoy­  
anco and provoking manner, Frank was  
always a llttlo unreasonable ; and ho was  
always bringing somebody homo to dinner  
when I least expected It. Just then llttlo  
Ted camo toddling in, and wanted to help.  
As I was about to make a change, of base,  
I took him with mo down to tho parlor,  
gavo him a rag and a basin of water, and  
told him ho might clean tho floor. Ho sat  
down in ono corner of tho room, aud with  
a f.ico of unearthly solemnity, at once  
commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Norah  
was up stairs washing windows In the front  
chamber. Suddenly thero camo a loud  
crai-h, followed by a terrific yell. It sound­  
od as If tho wliolo house was tumbling  
down. &quot;Ilea; ens I&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;what  
can have hat period 1&quot; I mounted the  
stairs, two steps at a time, and thcro beheld  
Norah lying full length ou the I&#x27;oor, a­  
midst a debris of broken step-ladder,  
pieces of glass mid soapsuds,  
&quot;What&#x27;s tho matter?&quot; I cried to tho  
groaning girl.  
&quot;Suromum, I fell off tho ladder agin  
tho windy an&#x27; cut nieself most awful,&quot;  
moaned Norah.  
I helped tho heavy girl to arise, hound  
up her lacerated arm, left her. to pick up  
tho fragments of glass and wood, aud re­  
turned to tho parlor, thero to And Ted  
scouring tho planu-legs with tho scrubbing  
brush. I quickly relieved him from all  
fiirthor labor, bundled him up, and sent  
lilm out In thu yard to play.  
&quot;Faith, mum,&quot; said Norah, standing In  
tho door, &quot;I feel so f.tlnt, an&#x27; If I don&#x27;t bo  
taking Bomethln&#x27; strong, I can&#x27;t work no  
more today,&quot;  
&quot;Then make yourself somo toa,&quot; 1 ro­  
plied.Hut Norah disdainfully said, &quot;Sure, I  
nover could stomach lay j tho very smoll  
of it makes mo sick,&quot;  
&quot;Well, then, tako some brandy,&quot; I re­  
plied, Now I ought to hao known bel­  
ter than to allow Norah to help herself to  
tho brandy ; but bolng in such a hurry to  
finish tho parlor, I could not conveniently  
stop, When I had occasion to go through  
the hall again, I paused and listened, I  
mouutod the stairs. Therein tho mlddlo  
of tho room, shu sat In a rocking chair I u  
bucket of water stood before her, whllo  
sha swayed lazily back and forth with tho  
mop In her hand, which left a long trail of  
dirty water behind it.  
&quot;Norah I&quot; I cried, &quot;didn&#x27;t I tell you to  
mop this floor?&quot;  
&quot;Faith, mum, and I&#x27;m dnln&#x27; It as fast as  
lean, she replied. &quot;How can you mop  
  
sitting down?&quot; Tasked Indignantly

&quot;Sure, I&#x27;m so tired, I thought I could do  
It better n-scttln&#x27; down,&quot; slio answered. j  
&quot;Get right up out of that chair,&quot; I said.  
Norah slowly nroe, and staggered a- j  
gainst tho wall.  
&quot;Hlc, mum, hlc.ycz seo I&#x27;d ory wake,&quot; j  
&quot;You&#x27;re drunk, yon had better say,&quot; I  
replied.  
&quot;Drunk, d&#x27;ye call It I&quot; oxclalmcd Noruh,  
angrily, trying to look dignified) &quot;drunk,  
after taking ono tay-spoonful of brandy In  
n quart of water I&quot;  
&quot;Ixjavo tho room and go to bed,&quot; 1 said  
Indignantly) to-morrow I shall dismiss  
you.&quot;  
After much arguing, Norah Anally de­  
cided to retire, and I was left sole monarch  
of all the dirt and disorder. I surveyed  
tho room for a whllo In despair) but tho  
work had to bo done, and I seized the mop  
and soon flnlshod.  
When I was about to doscend the stairs,  
all tired and dirty, I heard Frank calling,  
&quot;Hattlol Ilattle where in the world are  
you I&quot;  
&quot;Hero,&quot; I replied.  
frank; ramo up&#x27; the uncarpoLtl slairsf  
nnd stumbled over tho mop. &quot;Confonnd  
It,&quot; he cried, &quot;why Is this house as dark as  
&#x27;Well,&quot; ho went on, &quot;aro we to go  
supporloss as well asdlnnerless?&quot;  
&quot;There Is no firo made,&quot; I said, &quot;and No­  
rah is drunk, and I&#x27;m tired to death ; and  
and&quot; hero I burst Into tears, and sat  
down on tho wet floor.  
&quot;Why Hattlol Hattlol what aro you cry­  
ing about? I&#x27;ll makefile firo; nevermind  
alrout tho supper) had a capital dinner  
down town. Come down stairs out of this  
damp room.&quot; And Frank who always got  
good and sorry tho moment after ho was  
cross, helped me upon? tho floor, and down  
stairs Into tho kitchen, &quot;Now don&#x27;t cry  
any more,&quot; ho said, wiping mytear-bo-dowed  
cheeks with bis handkerchief) &quot;sit  
down, and I&#x27;ll havo aflro in two minutes.&quot;  
&quot;Whcro&#x27;s Ted?&quot; ho Inquired, pausing  
for breath between tho vigorous puifs at tho  
fire.  
&quot;I havn&#x27;t seen lilm all the afternoon. I  
sent him out to play, and ho hasn&#x27;t been  
In tho hotiso since,&quot; I replied,  
Frank dropped his shavings, and started  
out in search of him, I waited and waited  
and shivered wltn the cold, but no Frank  
came. I sat in the stiff-hacked chair and  
closed my eyc. Tim Iat tiling I remem­  
bered was a violent nod, which nearly dis­  
ioc.ited my neck.  
&quot;Hattlol&quot; I awoko with a l.ut. Frank  
was shaking inc.  
&quot;You&#x27;ll take your death-cold j yon have  
been fast asleep.&quot;  
&quot;Where was Ted? Did you lind him in  
tho cistern?&quot; I asked dreamily.  
&quot;No,&quot; laughed Frank, &quot;but Just about  
as bad; tho )oor fellow was in tho coal  
cellar, asleep llko his mother.&quot;  
I rubbed my eyes and looked at tho  
child. Ho was covered with coal dust from  
bis head to his feet, and was as black as a  
negro. Frank prepared Biipper, whllo I  
washed Ted&#x27;s faeo and hands.  
&quot;How can you finish your cleaning with­  
out Norah?&quot; ho inquired.  
&quot;I&#x27;m suro I don&#x27;t seo how I can,&quot; I ro­  
plllns the mountains of work arpso In  
my troubled mind. &quot;Norah must be sent  
away in tho morning.&quot;  
Woallalo heartily of our supper, not­  
withstanding tho eggs woro fried until they  
wcro so crisp and brlttlo that they broke  
Into bits If you so much as looked at them,  
nnd tho toast was burnt, and tho coffee not  
half liollod j still, as I was ravenously  
hungry, It all tosted pretty good. After  
wo liad cleared tho table, and piled the  
the dlshos away to bo washed tu tho morn­  
ing, wo retired j and being so fatigued, I  
did not awaken until a lato hour lu tho  
morning. Norah was dismissed, Frank  
wont to his office, and I to my cleaning.  
Frank had tho carpets shaken, and the par­  
lor floor being dry, I soon had It all tacked  
down ; then moved tho chairs In and be­  
gan to dust tho mantel ornaments; but oh,  
horror I I let fall ono of my loveliest vases,  
and shivered it Into a thousand fragments,  
A very bad beglnnlngof thoday, I thought,  
sorrowfully picking up tho plecjes,  
&quot;Mamma,&quot; cried a shrill voice, &quot;I&#x27;n all  
Jess up.&quot;  
&quot;Where aro you, Ted ?&quot; I called.  
&quot;Here,&quot; cried Ted.  
&quot;And where Is &#x27;here ;&#x27; you&#x27;re In somo  
mischief, I&#x27;ll bo bound.&quot;  
I hoard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, and a  
great scrambling up tho attic stairs. After  
1 had thrown tho shattered pieces of my  
vase away, I ran up stairs to seo what ho  
was doing. What a sight met my eyes I  
Ted was arrayed In my violet silk, pinned  
up in front, and trailing far behind on the  
floor) my whlto laeo shawl around his  
shoulders, and my best bonnet on his head.  
I stood transfixed for a moment, while  
Ted went prancing round and round In tho  
dust and dirt of tho attic, then I started af­  
ter him. Of coursoho ran, ncreanilng and  
laughing. &quot;Take carol&quot; I cried, hut too  
lato; he fell from tho top to the bottom of  
tho stairs.  
Hip, rip, went my violet silk; bump,  
bump, went Ted. I flow down stairs after  
him with my heart In my month, and  
picked up u little Insensible heap of laee,  
ribbons, silk and dirt, That full saved  
Ted from a good whipping. I carried him  
down stairs, and sprinkled him with  
water, camphor, cau-de-eologue, until ho  
opened his eyes then I examined my ru­  
ined clolhos. My dress va a mass of  
  
grease, cobwebs, and dust) tho front width  
was wretchedly lorn with tho pins; mr  
shawl and bonnet wero crushed and torn,  
I put them all away, with a sigh of regret,  
and turned my attention once more to tho  
perpetrator of tho terrible deed, Justthen  
some ono knocked on tho back door. On  
opening It, I found a stout Herman girl on  
tho step. Sho talked so broken that I could  
scarcely understand her, but managed to  
cotnprehond enough to know that Frank  
had engaged hor for me. I set her to work  
Immediately to clean tho china closet, and  
returned to my wounded Tod, Suddenly  
I heard a crash in tho dining room. &quot;Heav­  
ens I&quot; 1 exclaimed, &quot;what can havo hap­  
ponod now?&quot; and rushing out I found tho  
frightoned girl clasping and unclasping  
her hands In a heart-rending manner. No  
wonder. Sho had upset tho table on which  
all myshlnlng glass and china was placed.  
Everything was literally smashed to piec­  
es. My beautiful celery glasses t My gob.  
lets, and tea-set! My fruit-stands I Was  
there over such a poor, afflicted mortal as  
I? Words fall mo to oxpress my feelings  
at that moment. I sat down perfectly.  
siiinueii to witness mo narrowing sight of  
all my superb dishes swept away.  
There camo another knock at tho door.  
Tills tlmo mi Irish girl miulo her appear­  
ance. I wondered If Frank Intended to  
send a regiment to destroy my liouso.  
Howover, I took hor In, and tho llrst thing  
I tohl her to do was to answer tho door­  
bell, which had rung twice. I jieeped  
through the door, which wan partly open,  
and saw two ladles, but could not distin  
  
guish who they worn.  
&#x27; &quot;Mum, thcro Is two wlmmcn as wants  
tusooyoz,&quot; said Ann, giving tho door n  
violent push against my head.  
&quot;Oo tqll them to oxeuso mo,&quot; I said t  
and being cry dizzy from tho blow, I fail­  
ed to uotlco that Ann, In hor stupidity,  
had left tho sitting-room door wldo opeiv  
anil ns tho ladios came out of tho parlor,  
  
thoy saw mo plainly,  
.&quot;O mortification I&quot; I was all rB  
dirt, but had becomo somQWhat reconciled  
to my misfortunes by this tlmo.  
When Frank camo up to supper, tho  
hall was very dark), Ann was putting  
down tho door mat. Frank had forgotten  
all about tho now servant, and In tho dark­  
ness mistook tha horrid Irish girl for mo,  
and kissed her. Ann screamed and ran,  
and fell over a chair. Frank tore rouml  
and swore j said ho would rather bo In  
bedlam than w here a woman was cleaning  
houso ) wondered why I could not havo.tho  
hall lighted. To alt this I mado no reply,  
but smiled grimly. Being overwhelmed  
with my griefs, I did not caro If Frank  
l:lyel every scrvant-glrl In tha United  
rittiv..  
Tha next morning the airman girl loft.  
Probably sho was fearful sho would en­  
counter my frowns again. Ann remained  
and wo proceeded to finish our havoc. Tho  
day was gloriously begun by Ann, who  
succeeded charmingly In breaking tho  
globes of tho chandelier, and then upset­  
ting the gold-Hsli. I was exasperated at  
this. There lay my llsh on tho carpet, to  
say nothing of tho water. I believe I  
shook or slapped tho girl, I don&#x27;t remem­  
ber which. Ann was so astonished at see­  
ing mo fly Into such a passion, that sho  
backed up against tho window, and thrust  
her clumsy foot through my lace curlaln.  
This was tho grand finale. I burst Into  
tears, and so did Ann. Ted, hearing the  
tobs, camo running In, and not knowing  
what to mako of it, joined in and swelled  
tho chorus. Amidst one of our longest  
and loudest walls, tho street door sudden­  
ly flew opon, and In walked my Aunt  
Thankful, with sovcral dozen carpet-bags  
and bundles, prepared evidently, for a  
long visit.  
&quot;In tho namo of all that Is wonderful!&quot;  
sho shrloked, letting all her traps &#x27;fall,  
&quot;what has happened ? Is Frank dead, Ted  
scalded, or tho wliolo houso on fire.&quot;  
I made no reply, but sobbed mercilessly  
on.  
&quot;Ilaltie 1&quot; cried Aunt Thankful, iu an  
awful oicc, &quot;answer mo immediately.  
What Is tho matter?&quot;  
&quot;My laco curtain,&quot; 1 gurgled out.  
Aunt Thankful put on her spoctacles, sat  
down on tho floor, and examined It, &quot;Silly  
pus,&quot; sho mumbled, &quot;I can darn that In  
ten minutes.&quot;  
&quot;Yes with blno stocking yarn,&quot; I said,  
and began to laugh sarcastically, and then  
I l.iuglied, nnd laughed. Ann laughed,  
and Ted laughed. I&#x27;oor Aunt Thankful  
stared at us in horror, and said :  
&quot;flood heavens I they aro all stark mad )  
and Jumping up oir the floor, sho seized  
my arm and dragged mo Into tho bed­  
room, and put mo to bed, then went out  
and locked tho door, und loft mo alone. I  
went to sloop. When I awoko Aunt  
rViaikful was1 sitting by my bd sowing.  
&quot;Aunt Thankful,&quot; I said, &quot;whon did  
you conio?&quot;  
&quot;Yesterday morning,&quot; sho replied.  
&quot;What tlmo Is it now?&quot; I Inquired.  
&quot;Three o&#x27;clock,&quot; answered Aunt Thank­  
ful.&quot;I have slept several hours, then,&quot; I  
said. &quot;Was I asleep when you camo?&quot;  
&quot;I should rather think not ; when I camo  
yon were crazy, and I put you to lied.  
You slept nil tho rest of tho day and night  
until this blessed minute, and If you had  
not been put to bed you would have bcon  
In the Insane asylum now.&quot;  
I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful glared  
at mo and said :  
&quot;If you laugh any more, I will put you  
In the cellar, and feed you on bread and  
water for a weok.&quot;  
This not lielng a pleasant prospect, I sub­  
sided.i&quot;You aro a precious woman to clean  
house,&quot; continued she. &quot;I should have  
thought a child would know better than to  
commence to clean right in tho mlddlo of  
tho house. You should commence In tho  
attlo and go down. Don&#x27;t you know that  
after you get through with tho down-stairs  
tho dirt from tho attic will make It dirtier  
than over?&quot;  
&quot;I nover thought of that,&quot; I answered,  
meekly.  
&quot;And then begin when Its cold enough  
to freeze I It&#x27;s a wonder you didn&#x27;t havo  
the lung fqveror something worse,&quot; went  
on Aunt Thankful.  
&quot;I must get up and clean the attic,&quot; D  
said.  
&quot;No, you wont,&quot; said Aunt Thankful,  
&quot;forlcloancd It myself.&quot;  
&quot;Well, thero aro the rest of the carpets to  
put down.&quot;  
&quot;They&#x27;re all down.&quot;  
&quot;And tho pictures.&quot;  
&quot;All hung.&quot;  
I gave a great sigh of relief. What  
would I liavo dono If It had not been for  
Aunt Thankful I Sho hail accomplished In  
on? day what It would havo taken mo a  
wcok to perform ; but then, I never bob a­  
round like Aunt Thankful ; for she seems  
to bo mado of wire. I havo learned slneo  
then to tako Aunt Thankful&#x27;s advice, nev­  
er to commence cleaning until tho weather  
is warm, ami never to commence ut the  
urongend of tho house.  
Hut It was such a mortification to think  
that my new plan was a total failure.

 ! have I falleu so low ?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow.  
1 HOUSE CLEANING.  
Every year I endeavor to make some improvement  
in my method of house-cleaning.  
This spring I made up my mind to adhere no  
longer to the poky old plan of grandmother?  
which was to begin at the attic, and wind up  
in the cellar?but determined to strike out in  
another direction : and so, while the subject  
was rife in my mind, I set about executing my  
new projects at once, although it was but the  
first of April, and the weather quite chilly and  
raw. In the first place, I had every stove  
1. moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the  
pictures taken from the walls, the curtaius  
taken down, everything piled out on the buck  
  
if; porch, and the earjtetless halls tilled to overflowing  
with chairs, statues, leather dusters,  
[N vases, hair muttrasses, parian brackets, and  
jjf pillows ; and while everything was in the wildji  
est confusion, Frank cauie iu with distended  
&#x27;p eyes.  
(- &quot;What on earth is all this, IJattie ?&quot; he  
|i exclaimed.  
k&#x27; &quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing 111 uiy  
If: efforts to reach a stray cobweb, &quot;we have  
p commenced cleaning house,&quot; and 1 lowered iny  
S; broom, and looked straight iu his face to see if  
i, he fully realized the importance of these  
i? words; but to my chagrin, he looked utterly  
V indifferent, aud brushing off some stray cob  
fei webs which bad floated down from the ceiling  
If1 on to his coat sleeve, asked impatiently, &quot; Isn&#x27;t  
K dinner ready ?&quot; &quot; Dinner !&quot;&#x27; I cried , &quot; I had  
I*&#x27; no idea it was so late. I haven&#x27;t even comf&#x27;  
menced dinner yet.&quot;  
&quot;Pretty state of affairs,&quot; grumbled Frank,  
ft *&#x27; I brought Edward Graham home with me.&quot;  
&quot; Where is he?&quot; I asked faintly.  
R &quot;In the parlur,&quot; replied Frank, crustily.  
In * The floor is bare ; there isn&#x27;t a chair or any  
I thing else for the man to sit on. 1 expect I&#x27;ll  
1^ find him seated on the piano. But come,  
ji Hattie,&quot; he added, &#x27;* what are you going to  
i give us to eat ?&quot;  
|ij &quot;O, Frank,&quot; 1 .aid, coaxingly, thinking of  
&gt;1] my rough hair and the grease spots on my  
W dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your dinner down town  
|f| to day ?&quot;  
Hi Frank looked cross, and said he supposed he  
H could, and weHt dow n to the parlor. 1 leaned  
R over the banister, and when Frank opened the  
B| door, caught a glimpse of Ed. roaming around  
R the desolate room, shivering, with his hands in  
R) his pockets. 1 watched them go through the  
iff ball, and heard Frank making some hateful  
? remarks about women and house-cleaning.  
  
I He slammed the door violently, and 1 serenely  
resumed roy sweeping, not in &quot;the least disturbed  
by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed annoyance and  
&quot;provoking manner. Frank was always a little  
unreasonable; and he was always bringing  
somebody home to dinner when I least expected  
it.  
Just then little Ted came toddling in,and wanted  
to help. As I was about to make a change  
of base, 1 took him with me down to the parlor,  
gave hi:n a rag and a basin of water, and  
told him he might clean the tloor. He sat  
down in one corner of the room, and with a  
face of most unearthly solemnity, at once  
commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Nor ah was  
upstairs, washing windows in the front chamber.  
Suddenly there came a.loud crash, followed  
by a terrible yell; it sounded as if the  
whole house was tumbling down.  
&quot;Heavens!&quot; 1 exclaimed, &quot;what can have  
happened?&quot; I mounted the stairs, two steps at  
a time, and there beheld Xorah lying full  
length on the door, amidst the debris of a  
broken step-ladder, pieces of glass, and soapsuds.  
&quot;What is the matter ?&quot; I cried to the groauin*Pri­  
% , ,  
&quot;Shure, mum, 1 fell from the ladder agin the  
windy, au1 cut meself most awful,&quot; moaned  
Xorah.  
I helped the heavy girl to arise, bound up her  
lacerated arm, left her to pick up the fragments  
of glass and wood, and returned to the parlor,  
there to find Ted scouring the piano legs with  
the scrubbing brush. 1 quickly relieved him  
from all further labor, bundled him up, aud  
aeut him out in the yard to play.  
&quot;Faith, mum,&quot; said Xorah, standing in the  
door, &quot;1 feel so faint, au&#x27; if 1 don&#x27;t be takin&#x27;  
aomethiu&#x27;strong 1 can&#x27;t work no more to day.&#x27;*  
&quot;Then make yourself some tea,&#x27;&#x27; i replied.  
But Xorah disdainfully said :  
&quot;I never could stouiacb tay ; the very smiil  
of it makes roe sick.&quot;  
&quot;Well, then take some brandy,&quot; I replied  
Now I ought to have known better than to  
allow Xorah to help herself to the brandy, but  
being in such a hurry to timsh the parlor, 1  
could not couveuieutly stop.  
When I had occasion to go through the hall  
again, I paused aud listened ; 1 could hear  
nothing oi Xorah moving about, so ouce more  
  
II mounted the stairs. There, in the middle ot  
the room, she sat iu a rocking chair, a bucket  
of water sood before her, while she swayed  
lazily back and forth with the mop in her hand,  
which left a long trail of dirty water behind it.  
&#x27;Norah,&quot; 1 cried, &quot;didn&#x27;t i tell you to uiop  
tlua Uoor&#x27;/&quot;  
&quot;Faith, mum, an l&#x27;in doiu&#x27; it a? last as 1  
can,&#x27; ahe replied.  
&quot;How can you uiop sifting Joan ?&quot; 1 asked, &lt;  
indignantly.  
&quot;Get right out of that chair,&quot; 1 said.  
Norah slowly arose and staggered against  
the wall.  
Hie, mum, hie, yez see I se awake.&quot;  
&quot;You&#x27;re drank, you had better say,&quot; 1 re plied.  
&quot;Lfruuk, d&#x27;ye call it!&quot; exclaimed Norah, an- 1  
grily, trying to look diguitied ; &quot;drunk, after  
takin&#x27; one tay spoonful of brandy iu a quart of  
water!&quot;  
&quot;Leave the room and go to bed,&quot; 1 said iu- j  
dignautly ; &quot;to morrow 1 shall dismiss you.&quot;  
After much arguing, Norah finally decided  
to retire, and 1 was left sole monarch of all the !  
dirt and disorder.  
I surveyed the room for awhile in despair,  
but the work had to be done, and 1 seized the  
uiop and scon finished. When 1 was about to  
deeoeud the stairs, all tired and dirty, 1 heard  
Frank calling.  
&quot;Hattie! Hattie! where iu the world are  
yoo?&quot;  
f &quot;?ere,&quot; I replied.  
Frank came up the &lt;incar|a*ted stairs, aud  
tumbled over the mop.  
&quot;Confound it!&quot; he cried, &quot;why is this house  
as dark as Egypt? Well,&quot; be went on, &quot;are  
we to go to bed rapperles* as well as dinner  
iaeef  
&quot;There is do fire made,&#x27;* I said. &quot;Norah h  
drunk, and I am cired to death ; and?and?&quot; .  
here I burst into tears, and sat duwu ou the  
wet floor.  
&quot; Why, Hattie ! Hattie ! what arc you cry-1  
  
ing about? I&#x27;ll make the fire; never mind!  
about the sapper ; had a capital dioner down  
town ; come down stairs out of this damp  
room.&quot;  
And Frank, who always got good and sorry  
the moment after he was cross, helped me off  
the floor, and down stairs into the kitchen.  
* Now don&#x27;t cry any more,&quot; he said, wiping  
my tear-bedewed cheek with his handkerchief,  
&quot;sit down, and I&#x27;ll have a tire in two  
minutes.&quot;  
&quot;Where&#x27;s Ted?&quot; he inquired, pausing for  
  
breath between the vigorous puffs at the tire.  
&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen hiui all the afternoon. I  
sent him out to play and he hasn&#x27;t been in the  
house since,&quot; I replied.  
Frank dropped the shavings and started out  
in search of hi in.  
1 waited arid waited, and shivered with the  
cold, but no Frunk came. I sat in the stiff  
backed chair arid closed my eyes. The last  
I thing I remembered was a violent nod which  
nearly dislocated my neck.  
&quot; Hattie!&quot;  
1 awoke with a start. Frank was shaking  
me.  
&quot; You will take your death of cold ; you have  
been fast asleep.&quot;  
&quot;Where was Ted ? Did you find him in the  
cistern?&quot; 1 asked, dreamily.  
&quot;No,&quot; laughed Frank, &quot; but just about as  
bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar,  
asleep like his mother.&quot;  
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child;  
he was covered with coal dust from his head to  
his feet, and as black as any negro. Frank  
prepared supper while I washed Ted&#x27;s face aud  
hands. .  
&quot; llow can you finish your cleaning without  
Norah?&quot; he inquired.  
&quot; I am sure I don&#x27;t see how 1 can,&quot; I replied,  
as the mountains of work arose in my troubled  
tnind. &quot;Norah must be sent away in the  
morning.&quot;  
We all ate heartily of our BUpper, notwithstanding  
the eggs were fried until they were so  
Crist) aud brittle that they broke into bits if you  
so much as looked at them, and the toast was  
burnt, and the coffee not half boiled ; still, as I  
was so hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After  
  
we bad cleaned away the table and piled the  
dishes away to be washed in the morning, we  
retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken  
until a late hour in the morning.  
Norah was dismissed. Frank went to his  
office and 1 to tny cleaning. Frank had the  
carpet shaken, and the parlor floor being dry,  
I soon had it all tacked down ; then moved the  
chairs ili, and began to dust the mantel ornaments,  
but, O horror ! I let fall one of my  
loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand  
fragments. A very bad beginniug of the day,  
I thought, sorrowfully picking up the pieces.  
44 Mamma,&quot; cried a shrill voice, &quot; I&#x27;s all  
jess up.&quot;  
44 W here are you, Ted I called.  
44 Here,&quot; cried Ted.  
44 And where is 4here;&#x27; you&#x27;re in some mischief,  
I&#x27;ll be bound.&quot;  
1 heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, and a great  
scrambling up the attic stairs.  
After 1 had throwu the shattered pieces ol  
my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what ht  
was doing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted  
was arrayed iu my violet silk, pinned up it  
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my  
white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my  
best bonnet on his head.  
I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted  
went prancing round und round iu the dust and  
dirt of the attic ; then 1 started after him. Ol  
course be ran, screaming and laughing. 4,Tak&lt;  
care,&quot; I cried, but too late ; be fell from th&lt;  
top to the bottom of the stairs.  
Kip, rip, weut my violet silk ; bump, bump  
went Ted. I flew down after him with my hear  
in my mouth, and picked up a little iusensibh  
heap of lace, ribbous, silk and dirt. That fal  
saved Ted from a good whipping. I carriet  
him down stairs, and sprinkled him profusely  
With uut^r natnnhnr itmi onn Jo onliwrni&#x27; nnti  
  
be opened his eyes ; then 1 examined my ruinec  
clothes. My dress was a mass of grease, cob  
webs and dust , the front width was wretchedly  
torn with the puis; my shawl and bonnet was  
crushed and torn. 1 put them all away with ?  
sigh of regret, and turned my attention once  
more to the perpetrator of this terrible deed  
Just then some one knocked at the back door  
On opening it 1 found a stout German girl on  
the step who talked so broken that I coulc  
scarcely understand her, but managed to com  
prehend enough to know that Frank hud en  
gaged her for me. 1 set her to work iinmedi  
ately to clean the china closet, and returned tc  
uiy wounded Ted. Suddenly 1 heard a terrible  
crash in the dining-room. &quot;Ileavensl&quot; I ex  
claimed ; &quot;what can have happoued now ?&quot; and  
rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping  
and unclasping her hands in a heartrending  
mariner. No wonder. She had upset the table  
on which all my shining glass and chiuu wan  
placed. Everything was literally smashed to  
fiieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My gobets,  
and tea-set! My fruit stands ! Was there  
ever such a poor afflicted mortal as 1 &#x27;i Wordu  
failed me to express my feelings at that momeut.  
1 sat down perfectly stunned, to witnese  
the harrowiug sight of all uiy superb dishes  
swept away.  
There came another knock at the door. This  
time an Irish girl made her appearance. I  
i wondered if Frank intended to send a regiment  
! to destroy my house. However, J took her in,  
  
and the nrst thing 1 told her to do was to answer  
the door bell wliich bad rung twice. I  
peeped through the door, which was partly  
open, and saw two ladies, but could uot distinguish  
who tbey were.  
44 Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to  
see yez,&quot; said Anu, giving the door u violent  
push against my head.  
4*Go tell them to excuse me,&quot; I said ; and  
beiDg very dizzy from the blow, I failed to  
notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the  
sitting-rooiu door wide open, aud as the ladies  
came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.  
41 O mortification !&quot; I was all rags and dirt,  
but had become somewhat reconciled to any  
misfortunes by this time.  
When Frank came up to supper, the hall  
was very dark ; Ann was putting down the door  
mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant,  
and in the darkness mistook the horid Irish  
girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed  
and rau, and fell over a chair; Frank tore  
j round and swore : and said he would rather  
I be in Bedlam than where a woman was cleaning  
house ; wondered why I couldn&#x27;t have the hall  
lighted. To all this I made no reply, but  
smiled grimly. Being so overwhelmed with  
; my own griefs, 1 did not care if Frank kissed  
! every servant girl in the United States.  
The next morning the German girl left.  
Probably she was fearful she should encounter  
my frown again. Ann remained, and we proceeded  
to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously  
begun by Ann, who succeeded charui:  
iogly iu breaking the glultes of the chandelier,  
and upsetting my gold fish on the carpet, to  
say nothing of the water. 1 believe 1 shook or  
slapped the girl, 1 don&#x27;t remember which.  
Ann who art uKturiislieil wt n^?ini/ lite He into  
  
sucb a passion that she hacked up against the  
window and thrust her clumsy foot through  
&#x27; my lace curtain. This was the grand finale.  
1 hurst into tears and so did Ann. Ted, hearing  
the sobs, came running in, and not knowing  
what to make of it, joined in the chorus.  
Aiuidst one of our longest and loudest wails,  
the street door suddenly flew open, and in  
walked tuy Aunt Thankful, with several dozen  
carpet hags and bundles, prepared evidently  
for a long visit.  
iu the name of all that&#x27;s wonderful!&quot; she  
shrieked, letting all her traps fall. &quot; What  
has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded,  
or the house on fire?&quot;  
1 made no reply, hut sobbed heedlessly ou.  
&quot;ilattie!&quot; cried Aunt Thankful, in an awtul  
voice. &quot; Answer me immediately. What is  
the matter ?&quot;  
&quot; My lace curtain,&quot; I gurgled out.  
Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat  
down on the iiuor and examined it. &quot; Silly  
puss,&quot; she mumbled- &quot; I can darn that iu ten  
minutes.&#x27;&#x27;  
&quot; Yes, with blue stocking yarn,&quot; I said, and  
began to laugh sarcastically, and tbeu 1 laughed  
aud laughed. Ann laughed, and Ted laughed.  
Poor Aunt Thankful stared at us iu horror, and  
a**ist  
  
Miood Heavens! they are all stark mad;&quot;  
and jumped up off the floor ; ahe seized uiy ariu  
aud dragged me into the bed room, and put me  
to bed, then went out aud locked the door,  
and left me alone, i went to sleep. When I  
awoke Auut Thankful was fitting by the bed  
dewing.  
Aunt Thankful,&quot; 1 said, &quot;when did you  
come ?&quot;  
&#x27;Yesterday morning,&quot; she replied.  
44 What time is it now ?&quot; 1 inquired.  
&quot;Three o&#x27;clock,&quot; answered Auut Thankful.  
* 1 have slept several hours, then,&quot; 1 said.  
Was 1 asleep when you came?&quot;  
&quot;I should rather think not; when I came  
you were crazy, and I put you to bed. \rou (  
  
THE 3STE  
slept all the rest of the day and night until tb;s  
bleosed minute, and if you hadn&#x27;t been put to  
bed you would hare bean put in the insane asylam,  
now.&quot;  
I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful stared at  
me and said :  
&quot;If you laugh any more 1 will put you in  
the cellar, and feed you on bread and water for j  
a week.&quot;  
This not being a pleasant prospect, I subsided.  
&quot; You are a precious woman to clean house,&quot;  
continued she. &quot; 1 should have thought a child  
would know better than to commence to clean

Every yearlI endeavor to make some im-  
  
rovement in my method of house-cleaning.  
This spring I made up my mind to adhere no  
longer to the poky old plan of grandmother—  
which was to begin at the attic, and wind up  
in the cellar—but determined to strike out in  
snother direction; and so, while the subject  
was rife in my mind, I set about executing my  
  
  
  
new projects at once, although it was but the | j  
  
first of April, and the weather quite chilly and  
raw. In the first place, I had every stove  
moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the  
pictures taken from the walls, the curtains  
taken down, everything piled out on the buck  
pore and the carpetiess halls filled to over-  
  
owing with chairs, statues, feather dusters,  
vases, hair mattrasses, parian brackets, and  
pillows ; and while everything was in the wild-  
est confusion, Frank came in with ‘distended  
  
8.  
  
“‘What on earth is all this, Hattie?’ he  
exclaimed.  
  
**Why, Frark,” I replied, pausing in my  
efforts to reach a stray cobweb, “we have  
commenced cleaning house,” and I lowered my  
broom, and looked straight in his face to see if  
he fully realized the importance of these  
words ; but to my chagrin, he looked atterly  
indifferent, and brashing off some stray cob-  
webs which had floated down from the ceiling  
on to his coat sleeve, asked impatiently, “ Isn’t  
dinner ready ”’ “ Dinner!&quot; I cried; “I had  
no idea it was so late. I haven&#x27;t even com-  
menced dinner yet.’’ -  
  
‘Pretty state of affairs,” grumbled Frank.  
“TI brought Edward Graham home with me.”  
  
“‘ Where is he?’’ I asked faintly.  
  
“‘In the parlor,” replied Frank, crustily.  
“ The floor is bare ; there isn’t a chair or any-  
thing else for the man to sit on. I expect I&#x27;ll  
find him seated on the piano. But come,  
Hattie,” he added, “what are you going to  
give us to eat?’  
  
“O, Frank,’’ I said, coaxingly, thinking of  
my rough hair and the grease spots on my  
dress, ‘‘ can’t you get your dinner down town  
to-day ?”’  
  
Frank looked cross, and said he supposed he  
could, and went down to the parlor. 1 leaned  
over the banister, and when Frank opened the  
door, caught a glimpse of Ed. roaming around  
the desolate room, shivering, with his hands in  
his pockets. I watched them go through the  
hall, and heard Frank making some hateful  
remarks about women and pe fp  
He slammed the door violently, and J serenely  
resumed my sweeping, not in the least dis-  
turbed by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed annoyance and  
provoking manner. Frank was always a little  
unreasonable ; and he was always bringing  
somebody home to dinner when I least ex-  
pected it. orb  
  
Just then little Ted came toddling in,and want-  
ed tohelp. As I wae about to make achange  
of base, r took him with me down to the par-  
lor, gave him @ rag and a basin of water, and  
teld him he might clean the floor. He sat  
down in one corner of the room, and with a  
face of most unearthly solemnity, at once  
commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Norah was  
upstairs, washing windows in the front cham-  
ber. Suddenly there came a loud crash, fol-  
lowed by a terrible yell; it sounded as if the  
whole house was tumbling down.  
  
“Heavens!” I exclaimed, ‘‘what can have  
happened ?” I mounted the stairs, two steps at  
@ time,and there beheld Norah lying fall  
len on the floor, amidst the debris of a  
broken step-ladder, pieces of glass, and soup-  
suds.  
  
“What is the matter ?” I cried to the groan-  
ing girl.  
  
“Shure, mum, I fell from the ladder agin the  
windy, an’ cut meself most awful,’ moaned  
Norah.  
  
I helped the heavy girl to arise, bound up her  
lacerated arm, left her to pick up the fragments  
of glass and wood, and returned to the parlor,  
there to find Ted scouring thé piano legs with  
the scrubbing brush. I quickly relieved him  
from all farther labor, bundled bim up, and  
sent him out in the yard to play.  
  
‘Faith, mum,” said Norab, standing in the  
door, “I feel so faint, aun’ if I don’t be takin’  
somethin’ stroog I can’t work no more to-day.”  
  
“Then make yourself some tea,” I replied.  
  
But Norah disdeinfully said :  
  
“JT never could stomach tay; the very sinill  
of it makes me sick.”  
  
“Well, then take some brandy,’’ I replied  
  
Now I ought to have known better than to  
allow Norah to help herself to the braady, but  
being in such a burry to finish the parlor, |  
could not conveniently stop.  
  
When I had occasion to go through the hall  
again, 1 paused and listened; 1 could hear  
nothing of Norah moving about, so once more  
I mounted the stairs. There, in the middle of  
the room, she sat in a rocking chair, a bucket  
of water sood before her, while she swayed  
lazily back and forth with the mop in her hand, |  
which left a long trail of =e § water behind it. |  
  
‘‘Norah,’’ I cried, “‘dida’t 1 tell you to mop  
this floor?’’  
  
“Faith, mum, an’ I&#x27;m doin’ it as fast as I  
can,” she replied.  
  
“How can you mop sifting down?” I asked,  
indignantly. :  
  
“Get right out of that chair,’ I said.  
  
Norah slowly aruse and staggered against  
the wall.  
  
**Hic, mum, bic, yez see I’se awake.”  
  
“You&#x27;re drunk, you bad better say,’ I re  
  
lied.  
“Drank, d’ye call it!” exclaimed Norah, an-  
grily, trying to look dignified ; “drunk, after  
takin’ one tay-speonful of brandy in a quart of  
water !’’  
  
“Leave the room and go to bed,’’ I said in-  
dignantly ; “to-morrow I shall dismiss you.”  
  
After much argaing, Norah omen decided  
to retire, and I wag left svle monarch of al! the  
dirt and disorder. ‘a ‘  
  
I surveyed the room for awhile in despair,  
but the work had to be done, and! seized the  
mop and soon finished. When I was about to  
descend the stairs, all tired and dirty, I beard  
Frank calling.  
  
“Hattie! Hattie! where ia the world are  
you?”  
  
vars I replied.  
  
rank came up the uncarpeted stairs, and  
stumbled over the mop. eee  
  
“Confound it!&quot; he cried, “why is this house }*  
  
as dark‘us Perpt? Well,” be went on, “are  
ahd at sapperiers-as welt as dinher--  
  
“There is no fice made,” I onid. “N

Uawoke with a start. Frank was shaking  
me.  
  
“ You will take your death of cold ; you have  
been fast asleep.”  
‘“Where was Ted? Did you find him in the  
  
asleep like his mother.”  
  
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child;  
he was cov with coal dust from bis head to  
his feet, and as black as any negro.

°  
“How can you finish your cleaning withoat  
Norah ?”’ he Reslied. :  
“T am sare I don’t see how I can,” I rep!  
as the mountains of work arose in my  
miod. “Norah must be sent away in

was so hungry, tas tt  
we bad cleaved away the table &quot;aa piled  
dishes eee | to be washed in the morning,  
retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken  
until a late hour in the morning.  
  
Norah was dismissed. Frank went to his  
office and 1 to my cleaning. Frank hed the  
carpet shaken, and the parer floor beis  
I soon had it all tacked down ;  
chairs if, and began to dust the mantel orna-  
ments, but, O horror!  
loveliest vases and shivered it into a tho  
fragments. A very bad beginning of the day,  
I thought, sorrowfully picking up the pieces.  
  
“Mamma,” cried a shrill voice, “I&#x27;s all  
  
jess ~  
  
‘‘Where are you, Ted ?” I called.  
  
‘* Here,” cried Ted.  
  
* And where is ‘here;’ you&#x27;re in some mis-  
ebief, 1&#x27;ll be bound.”  
  
I heard Ted’s chuckling laugh, and 9 great  
scrambling bh the attic stairs.  
  
After I had thrown the shattered pieces of  
my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what he  
was doing. What a sight met my eyes! Ted  
was arrayed in my violét silk, pinned up in  
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my  
white lace shaw! around his shoulders, and my  
best bonnet on his head.  
  
I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted  
went prancing round and round in the dust and  
  
course he ran, screaming and laughing. “Take  
care,” I cried, but too late; he felt from the  
top to the bottom of the stuirs.  
ip, rip, went my violet silk ; bump, bump,  
went Ted. I flew down after him with my heart  
in my mouth, and picked yp a little insensible  
heap of lace, ribbons, silk and dirt. That fall  
sated Ted from a good whipping. I carried  
him down stairs, and sprinkled him profusely  
with water, camphor, and eau-de-cologne, until  
he opened his eyes ; then I examined my ruined  
clothes. My dress was a mass of grease, cob-  
webs and dust ; the front width was wretchedly  
torn with the pins; my shawl and bonnet was  
crushed and tora. I put them all away with a  
sigh of regret, and turned my attention once  
more to the perpetrator of this terrible deed.  
Just then some one knocked at the back door.  
On opening it 1 found a stout German girl on  
the step who talked so broken that I could  
searcely understand her, but managed to com-  
prehend enough to know that Frank had en-  
gaged her for me. 1 set her to work immedi-  
ately to clean the china closet, and retarned to  
my wounded Ted. Suddenly I heard a terrible  
crash in the dining-room. ‘‘Heavens!” I ex-  
claimed ; “what can have happened now ?’’ and  
rushing out I found the frightened girl clasp-  
ing and unclasping her hands ina heartrending  
manner. No wonder. She had upset the table  
en which all my shining glase and china was  
placed. Everything was literally smashed to  
jeces. My beautiful celery glasses! My A one  
ets, and tea-set! My fruitatands! Was there  
ever such @ poor afflicted mortal as 1? Words  
failed me to express my feelings at that mo-  
ment. I sat down perfectly stunned, to witness  
the harrowing sight of all my superb dishes  
swept away. r  
  
There came another knock at the door. This  
time an Irish girl made her appearance. I  
wondered if Frank intended to send a regiment  
to destroy my house. However, ] took ber in,  
and the first thing I told her to do was to an-  
swer the door bell which had rung twice. I  
peeped through the door, which was partly  
open, and saw two ladies, but could not dis-  
tinguish who they were.  
  
“Mam, there are two wimmen as wants to  
see yez,” said re the door a violent  
push against my head.  
  
“Go tell them to excuse me,’ I said; and  
being very dizzy from the blow, I failed to  
notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the  
sitting-roora door wide open, and as the ladies  
came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.  
  
“© mortification !” I was all rags and dirt,  
but had become somewhat reconciled to any  
misfortunes by this time.  
  
When Frank caiie up to supper, the hall  
was very dark ; Ann was putting down the door  
mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant,  
and in the darkness mistook the horid Irish  
girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed  
and ran, and fell over a chair; Frank tore  
round and swore: and seid he would rather  
be in Bedlam than where a woman was on  
house; wondered why I couldu&#x27;t have the hall  
lighted. To all this I made no reply, but  
smiled grimly. Being so overwhel: with  
my own griefs, 1 did not care if Frank kissed  
every servant girl in the United States.  
  
The next morning the German ‘girl left.  
Probably she was fearful she should encounter  
in. Aon remained, and we pro-  
ceeded to finish our havoc. The day was glo-  
riously begun by Aun, who succeeded charm-  
ingly in breaking the ~ of rong om pe  
and upsetting my gold fish on carpet, to  
say ockine of the water. I believe I shook or  
slapped the girl, I don’t remember which.  
Ann was so astonished at seeing me fy into  
such a passion that she backed up against the  
window and thrust her clamsy foot th h  
my lace curtain. This was the grand finale.  
I burst into tears and so did Ann. Ted, hear-  
ing the sobs, came running in, and not kuow-  
ing what to make of it, joined in the chorus.  
Amidst one of our longest and loudest wails,  
the street door suddenly flew open, and in  
walked my Aunt Thankful, with several dozen  
carpet bags and bundles, prepared evidently  
for a long visit.  
=“ Io the name of all that&#x27;s wonderful !&#x27;’ she  
shrieked, letting all her traps fall. “ What  
has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded,  
or the house on fire?”  
  
I made no reply, but sobbed heedlessly on.  
** Hattie !’’ cried Aunt Thaokfal, in an awfal  
  
1 ee  
“ y curtain,”’ gar; out.  
Aunt Thankful put on Se esti eat  
  
down on the floor and examined it. “ Silly  
puss,” she mumbled. “I can darn that in ten  
  
, with blue stocking yarn,”’ I said, and  
to laugh tically, and then I  
ghed. Ann laughed, and Ted lnothed,  
  
said :  
  
and left me alone. I went to sleep.

ry the moment after he was cross, helped  
me up off the floor, and down stairs into the  
kitchen.  
&quot;Now, don&#x27;t cry any more,&quot; he said, wip­  
ine my tear-bedewed cheeks with his hand­  
kerchief; sit down, and I&#x27;ll have a fire in  
two minutes.&quot;  
&quot;Where&#x27;s Ted P&quot; he inquired, pausing for  
breath between the vigorous puffs at the  
fire.  
&quot;I&#x27; haven&#x27;t seen him all the afternoon. I  
sent him out to play, and he hasn&#x27;t been in  
the house since,&quot; I replied.  
Frank dropped the shavings and started  
out in search of him. I waited and waited,  
and shivered with the cold, but no Frank  
came.. I sat in the stiff-backed chair and  
closed my eves. The last thing I remember  
was a violent nod which nearly dislocated  
my neck.  
&quot;Hattie !&quot; I awoke with a start. Frank  
was shaking me,  
&quot;You will take your death cf cold; you  
have been fast asleep.&quot;  
&quot;Where was Ted? did you findhim in the  
cistern ?&quot; I asked, dreamily.  
&quot;No,&quot; laughed Frank, &quot;but just about as  
bad; the peor fellow was in the coal cellar  
asleep, like his mother.&quot;  
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child  
he was covered with coal dust from his head  
to his feet, and was as black as a negro.  
Frank prepared supper while I washed Ted&#x27;s  
face and hands.  
&quot;How can you finish your cleaning with­  
out Norah ?&quot; he inquired.  
&quot;I am sure I don&#x27;t see how I can,&quot; I re  
plied, as the mountain of work arose in my  
troubled mind. &quot;Norah must be sent away  
in the morning.&quot;  
We all ate heartily of our supper, not­  
withstanding the eggs were fried until they  
were so crisp ani brittle that they broke in­  
to bits if you so much as looked at them.  
and the toast was burnt, and the coffee not  
half boiled; still, as I was ravenously hun­  
gry, it all tasted pretty good. After we had  
cleared away the table, and piled the dishes  
away to be washed in the morning, we re­  
tired, and being so fatigued, I did not awak­  
en until a late hour in the morning. Norah  
was dismissed, Frank went to his office, and  
I to my cleaning. Frank had the carpets  
shaken, and the parlor floor being dry, I  
soon had it all tacked down, and then moved  
the chairs in,and began to dust the mantel  
ornaments; but, Oh, horror! I let fall one  
of my loveliest vases and shivered it into a  
thousand fragments. A very bad beglnn&amp;ng  
of the day, I thought, sorrowfully, picking  
nu the pieces.  
&quot;Mamma,&quot; cried a shrill voice, &quot;I is al  
jessed up.&quot;  
&quot;Where are you, Teddy ?&quot; I called.  
&quot;Here,&quot; cried Ted.  
&quot;And where is &#x27;here?&#x27; You&#x27;re in some  
mischief, I&#x27;ll be bound.&quot;  
I heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, and a  
great scrambling up the attic stairs. After I  
had thrown the shattered pieces of my vase  
away, I ran up stairs to see what he was do­  
ing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted was  
arrayed in my violet silk, pinned up in front  
and trailing far behind en the floor, my  
white shawl around his shoulders,and my  
best bonnet on his head. I stood transfixed  
for a moment, while Ted went prancing  
round and round in the dust and dirt of the  
attic; then I started after him. Of course  
he ran, screaming and laughing. &quot;Take  
care,&quot; I cried, but too late; he tell from the  
top to&#x27; she bottom of the stairs.  
  
ip. rip, went my violet silk; bump,bump,  
went Ted. I flew down alter him with my  
heart in my month, and picked up a little in­  
sensible heap of lace, ribbons, silk and dirt.  
That fall saved Ted from a good whipping.  
I carried him down stairs and sprinkled him  
profusely with water, camphor and eau-de­  
cologne, until he opened his eyes; then I ex­  
amined my ruined clothes. My dress was a  
mass of grease, cobwebs and dust ; the front  
width was wretchedly torn with the pins;  
myshawl and bonnet were erushed and torn.  
I put them all away with a sigh of regret,  
and turned my attentien once more to the  
perpetrator of this terrible deed. Just then  
same one knocked at the back door. On  
opening it, I found a stout German girl on  
the step; she talked so broken that I could  
hardly understand her, but managed to  
comprehend enough to know that Frank had  
engaged her for me. I set aer to work im­  
mediately to clean the china closet, lhd re­  
turned to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I  
heard a terrible crash in the dining-room.  
&quot;Heavens!&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;what can have  
happened now &quot; and rushtng out I found  
the frightened girl elasping and unclasping  
her bands in a heartrendnlg manner. No  
wonder. She had upset the table on which  
allmy shiinng glass and chinawas placed.  
Everything was literally smashed to pieces.  
My beautiful celeryglasses! My goblesand  
tea-set! My fruit stands! Was there ever  
sunch a poor affleted mortal as I? Words fail  
me to express my feelings at that moment,  
Isatdown per_ t stunned, towitness the  
harrowg sight of all my superb dishes  
swept away.  
There came another knock at the door.  
This time an Irish girl made her appear­  
anep. I wonder if Frank intended to send a  
regiment to destroy my house. However, I  
took herin, and the irst thing I told her to  
do was to answer the door , which rung  
twie.I peeped through the door,  
which was partly open, and saw twoladies,  
but could not distinguish who they were.  
&quot;Mum, they are two wiomen as wants to  
see yes,&quot; said Ann, giving the door a vio­  
leatllash gastit rmy . d.  
  
&quot;Go tell them to excuse me,&quot; I raid, and  
biteg ery dizzy from the blow, I failed to  
noteie that Ann, in her stupidity. had left  
the sitag-room door wide open, and as the  
ladies came out of the parlor, they saw me  
&quot;Oh, manrtleation &quot; Iwas all rags and  
dirt, but had become somewhat recoeclled  
tome~ by.this am.  
When Frank caue to supper the hall was

&quot;Yesterday morning,&quot; she replied.  
&quot;What time is it now?&quot; I inquired.  
&quot;Three o&#x27;clock,&quot; answered aunt Thank­  
ful.  
&quot;I have slept several hours, then,&quot; I said.  
&quot; Was I asleep when you came?&quot;  
&quot; I should rather think not; when I came  
you were crazy, and I put you to bed. You  
slept all the restot the day and night until  
this blessed minute; it you hadn&#x27;t been put  
to bed you would have been in the insane  
Lasyhum now.&quot;  
I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful glared  
at me and said :  
&quot;If you laugh any more I will put you in  
the cellar and feed you on bread and water  
for a week.&quot;  
This not being a pleasant prospect, I sub­  
sided.  
&quot;You are a precious woman to clean  
house,&quot; continued she. &quot;I should have  
thought that a child would know better  
than to commence to clean in the middle o

the house. You should commence in the  
attic and go down. Don&#x27;t you know that  
after you get through with the down-stairs  
the dirt from the attic will make it all dirti­  
er than ever?&quot;  
&quot;I never. thought of that,&quot; I answered  
meekly.  
&quot;And then to begin whc n it&#x27;s cold enough  
to freeze. It&#x27;s a wonder you didn&#x27;t have  
the lung fever, or something worse,&quot; went  
on aunt Thankful.  
&quot;I must get up and clean the attic.&quot; I  
said.  
&quot;No, you won&#x27;t,&quot; said aunt Thankful,  
&quot;for I c!eaned it myself.&quot;  
&quot; Well, there are the rest of the carpets to  
put down.&quot;  
&quot;They&#x27;re all down.&quot;  
&quot;And the pictures ?&quot;  
&quot; All hung.&quot;

I have done if it had not been for aunt  
Thankful! She had accomplished In one  
day what it would have taken me a week to  
perform; but then I could nover bob around  
like aunt Thankful, she seems to be made cf  
wire. I have learned since then to take  
aunt Thankful&#x27;s advice, never commence  
cleaning until the weather is warm. and  
never to commence at the wrong end of the  
house.  
But it was such a mortification to think  
that my new plan was a total failure
