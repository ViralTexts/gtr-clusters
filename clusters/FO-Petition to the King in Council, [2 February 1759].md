y the Lieut. Governor, the Speaker, and several Members of the Assembly and others with the Indians The said Delawarr King Teedyuscung on the 28th of that Month delivered himself as follows.  
“The Complaints I made last Fall, I yet continue. I think some Lands have been bought by the Proprietary, or his Agents, from Indians who had not a right to Sell, and to whom the Lands did not belong. I think also, when some Lands have been Sold to the proprietary by Indians who had a Right to Sell to a certain place, whether that purchase was to be Measured by Miles or Hours Walk, that the Proprietaries have, contrary to Agreement or Bargain taken in more Lands than they ought to have done, and Lands that belonged to others. I therefore now desire that you will produce the Writings and Deeds by which you hold the Land, and let them be read in Publick, and Examined, that it may be fully known from what Indians you have bought the Lands you hold, and how far your purchases extend, that Copies of the whole may be laid before King George and published to all the provinces under his Government. What is fairly bought and paid for I make no further Demands about: But if any Lands have been bought of Indians to whom these Lands did not belong, and who had no Right to sell them, I expect a satisfaction for these Lands. And if the Proprietaries have taken in more Lands than they bought of true Owners, I expect likewise to be paid for that

forefathers conquered the Delawares and put petticoats  
onthem. A long time after that they lived among you  
our brothers, but upon some difference between you  
and them we thought proper to remove them, giving  
them lands to plant and hunt on at Wyoming and Juni-

plantations there and spoiled their hunting grounds —
