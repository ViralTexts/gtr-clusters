6. It is reasonable for us, O ye Americans! tho’ we know the fond preference you give to the manufactures of your mother-country is so great, that a piece of French cloth, or silk, was never worn among you, but even when taken in prizes, has been sent away to the French islands, as unsaleable with you, yet, to make you odious here, draw severities upon you, and wean that affection you have for this country, which is so advantageous to our commerce, we are to charge you with a fondness for French manufactures, without the least foundation of truth. In fine, It is reasonable for us to deprive you even of the common privilege of Englishmen, trials by Juries; to restrain, by every means, your procuring money from foreigners, to refuse you even the use of paper money, whereby you might better spare your cash to us, and, after all, to “wonder that you do not pay your debts.

regard to AMERICA.—It is reasonable for  
us, O ye Americans! though we know the fond  
preference you give to the manufactures of  
your mother country is so great, that a piece  
of French cloth, nr silk, was never worn among  
you, but even when taken in prizes, has been  
sent away to the French islands, as unsaleable  
with you, yet, to make you odious here, draw  
severities upon you, ami wean that affection  
yon have for this country, which is so advan­  
tageous to our commerce, we are to charge  
you w ith a fondness for French manufactures,  
without the least foundation of truth. In fine,  
it is reasonable tor us to deprive you even of  
the common privilege of Englishmen, trials by  
juries: to restrain, by every means, your pro­  
curing money from foreigners, to refuse you  
even the use of paper, whereby you might bet­  
ter spare your cash to us, and, after all, to  
“wonder that you do not pay your debts.
