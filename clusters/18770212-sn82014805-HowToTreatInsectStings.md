FIELD AND FIRESIDE.  
How to Treat Insect Stings.  
  
The pain caused by the sting of ? plant or  
ioseot is the result of a oartain amount of acid  
poisen injected into the blood. The first  
thing to be done is to press the tube of a  
(?mail key firmly on the wound, moving the  
key from side to side to faciliate the expul­  
sion of the Bting and its accompanying poi­  
son. The sting, if left in the wound, should  
be carefully extracted, otherwise it will great­  
ly increase the local irritation. The poison of  
stings being acid, common sense points to the  
alkalies as the proper means of cure. Among  
. the most easily procured remedies may be  
mentioned soft soap, liquor-of ammonia  
(spirits of hartshorn), smelling salts, washing  
soda, quicklime made into a paste with water,  
lime water, the juice of an onion, tobacco  
juice, chewed tobacco, bruised dock leaTes,  
tomato juice, wood ashes, tobacco ash, and  
carbonato of soda.  
If the sting be severe, rest and coolness  
should be added to the other remedies, more  
especially in the case of nervous subjects.?  
Nothing is so apt to make the poison^ active  
as heat, and nothing favors its activity less  
than cold. Let the body be kept cool and at  
rest, and the aotivity of the poison will be  
roduced to a minimum. Any active exertion  
Whereby tbe circulation is quickened will in­  
crease both pain and swelling. If the swel­  
ling be severe, the part may be rubbed with  
sweet oil, or drop or two of laudanum.?  
Stings in the eye, ear, mouth or throat, some­  
times lead to serious conecquences ; in such  
cases medical advice should always be sought  
as soon as possiblo.?London Garden

INSECT STINGS.  
  
[is pain caused by the sting of a plant or  
  
  
  
insect is the result of a certain amount of  
acid poison injected into the blood. The  
first thing to be done is to press the tube of a smal!  
key from side to side, to facilitate the expulsion  
of the sting and its accompanying poisen. The  
  
| sting, if left in the wound, should be carefully  
  
extracted ; otherwise it will greatly increase the  
local irritation. The poison of stings being acid,  
  
| common sense points to the alkalies as the proper  
  
means of cure. Among the most easily procured  
remedies may be mentioned soft soap, liquor of  
ammonia (spirits of hartshorn), smelling-salts,  
washing-soda, quicklime made into a paste with  
water, the juice of an onion, tobacco juice, chewed  
  
| tobacco, bruised dock leaves, tomato juice, wood  
  
ashes, tobacco ashes and carbonate of soda. If  
  
| the sting be severe, rest and coolness should be  
  
added to the other remedies, more especially in  
the case of nervous subjects. Nothing is so apt to  
make the poison active as heat, and nothing  
favors its activity less than cold. Let the body  
be kept cool and at rest, and the activity of the  
  
| poison will be reduced to a minimum, Any  
  
active exertion whereby the circulation is quick-  
ened will increase both pain and swelling. If the  
swelling be severe, the part may be rubbed with  
sweet oil or a drop or two of laudanum. Stings  
in the eye, ear, mouth or throat sometimes lead  
to serious consequences; in such cases medical  
advice should always be sought as soon as pos-  
  
sible.
