economical mode of cooking than roast  
ing, especially in small families where  
economical stoves or ranges with side

oss of weight than in roasting, as the  
oint is less dried. Care should be  
taken that the floor of the oven is not  
too much heated or the fat may be  
burnt, which causes a bad flavor. A  
great advantage in baking is that it re  
quires less attention than roasting and  
that potatoes or a batter or Yorkshire  
pudding can be cooked under the meat.  
This latter may be made by taking four  
tablespoonruls of nour and rubbing  
them into a smooth batter with a pint  
of milk which has previously had a  
well-beaten egg mixed with it. If eggs  
are abundant, 2 or 3 may be employed

being lessened. The milk and egg must  
be added gradually, the batter being  
rubbed until uniformly smooth after

How TO TREAT INSECT STINGS.—  
The pain caused by the sting of a plant  
or insect is the result of a certain  
amount of acid poison injected into the  
blood. The first thing to be done is to  
press the tube of a small key firmly on  
ths wound, moving the key from side  
to side to facilitate the expulsiori of the  
sting and its accompanying poison.  
The sting, if left in the wound, should  
be carefully extracted, otherwise it will  
greatly increase the local irritation.  
The poison of stings being acid, com-  
mon sense points to the alkalies as the  
proper means of cure. Among the  
most easily procured remedies may be  
mentioned, soft soap, liquor of ammo-  
nia, (spirits of hartshorn,) smelling  
salts, washing soda, quicklime made  
into paste with water, lime water, the  
juice of an onion, tobacco juice, chewed  
tobacco, bruised dock leaves, tomato  
juice, wood ashes, tobacco ash, and  
carbonate of soda.  
  
If the sting be severe, rest and cool-  
ness should be added to the other  
remedies, more especially in the case  
of nervous subjects. Nothing is so apt  
to make the poison active as heat, and  
nothing favors its activity less than cold.  
Let the body be kept cool and at rest,  
and the activity of the poison will be  
reduced to a minimum. Any active  
exertion whereby the circulation is  
quickened will increase both pain and  
swelling. If the swelling be severe,

INSECT STINGS.  
  
[is pain caused by the sting of a plant or  
  
  
  
insect is the result of a certain amount of  
acid poison injected into the blood. The  
first thing to be done is to press the tube of a smal!  
key from side to side, to facilitate the expulsion  
of the sting and its accompanying poisen. The  
  
| sting, if left in the wound, should be carefully  
  
extracted ; otherwise it will greatly increase the  
local irritation. The poison of stings being acid,  
  
| common sense points to the alkalies as the proper  
  
means of cure. Among the most easily procured  
remedies may be mentioned soft soap, liquor of  
ammonia (spirits of hartshorn), smelling-salts,  
washing-soda, quicklime made into a paste with  
water, the juice of an onion, tobacco juice, chewed  
  
| tobacco, bruised dock leaves, tomato juice, wood  
  
ashes, tobacco ashes and carbonate of soda. If  
  
| the sting be severe, rest and coolness should be  
  
added to the other remedies, more especially in  
the case of nervous subjects. Nothing is so apt to  
make the poison active as heat, and nothing  
favors its activity less than cold. Let the body  
be kept cool and at rest, and the activity of the  
  
| poison will be reduced to a minimum, Any  
  
active exertion whereby the circulation is quick-  
ened will increase both pain and swelling. If the  
swelling be severe, the part may be rubbed with  
sweet oil or a drop or two of laudanum. Stings  
in the eye, ear, mouth or throat sometimes lead  
to serious consequences; in such cases medical  
advice should always be sought as soon as pos-  
  
sible.
