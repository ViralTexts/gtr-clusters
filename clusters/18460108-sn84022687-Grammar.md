ENGLISH GRAMMAR.  
English Grammar does us teach,  
That it has nine parts of speech;  
Article, Adjective and Noun,  
Verb, Conjunction and Pronoun;  
With Preposition and Adverb,  
And Interjection as I’ve heard.  
The letters are just twenty-six,  
These form all words when rightly mixed.  
The Vowels are A E O I,  
With U and sometimes W and Y;  
Without the little vowel’s aid,  
No word or syllable is made ;  
But Consonants the rest we call,  
And so of these we’ve mentioned all.  
  
1. Three little words we often see  
Are Articles, a, an, and the.  
  
2. A Noun’s the name of any thing,  
As School, or Garden, Hoop or Swing.  
  
3. Adjectives tell the kind of noun,  
As great, small, pretty, white or brown.  
4. Instead of nouns the pronouns stand,  
John’s head, his face, my arm, your hand.  
5. Verbs tell of something being done,  
To read, write, count, sing, jump or run.  
6. How things are done the Adverbs tell,  
As slowly, quickly, ill or well.  
7. Conjunctions join the noun together,  
As Men and Children, wind or weather.  
8. A Preposition stands before  
A —as in or through a door.  
  
9. The Interjection showsstirprise,  
As, Oh how pretty! Ah how wise!  
The whole are called nine parts of speech,  
Which Reading, Writing, Speaking teach.

aluminium renders  
iron softer and naturally increases considerably the force  
of transverse resistance of white cast-iron, which is ordi-  
narily porous. It also improves gray cast-iron, though to  
extent. The presence of aluminium has a still  
greater effect in augmenting the resistance to shocks.  
Aluminium augments the elasticity and diminishes the  
strain due to internal tension.
