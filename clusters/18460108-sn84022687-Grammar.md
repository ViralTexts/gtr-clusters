 Bible :  
  
Being once asked by a friend to sit for his por-  
trait, he at length reluctantly consented. “ How”  
said his friend, “would you like to be painted ?”  
“Sitting among books.” ‘Any book in particular?”  
“ The Bible.”  
  
He lived to a great age. His good habits ren-  
dered him healthy. He was beloved and honored ;  
and his end was peace.

The following, on the “ Nine Parts of  
Speech,” may be very profitably com­  
mitted to memory. It is the whole of’  
grammar :   
1. Three little words you often see   
Are articles—a, an and the.   
2. A Noun’s the name of any thing,  
As school or garden, hoop or swing.   
3. Adjectives tell the kind of Noun,   
As great, small, pretty, white or brown.   
4. Instead of Nouns the Pronouns stand—   
Her head, his face, your arm, my hand,   
5. Verb* tell of something being done—   
To read, count, sing, laugh, jiimp or run.   
6. How’ things are done the Adverbs tell—   
As slowly, quickly, ill or well.   
7. Conjunctions join the words together—  
As men and women, wind or weather.   
8. The Preposition stands before   
. A Noun, as in or through a door.   
9. The Interjection shows surprise,   
As oh! how pretty, ah! how wise.
