ril 18th. 1754  
Since September last, having been abroad on two long Journeys, and otherwise much engag’d, I have made but few Observations on the positive and negative State of Electricity in the Clouds. But Mr. Kinnersley kept his Rod and Bells in good Order, and has made many. Once this Winter the Bells rang a long time during a fall of Snow, tho’ no Thunder was heard nor Lightning seen. Sometimes the Flashes and Cracks of the Electric Matter between Bell and Bell were so large and loud, as to be heard all over the House: But by all his Observations the Clouds were constantly in a negative State, till about Six Weeks ago, when he found them once to Change in a few Minutes from the negative to the positive. About a fortnight after that, he made another Observation of the same kind: And last Monday afternoon, the Wind blowing hard at S.E. and veering round to N.E. with many thick driving Clouds, there were 5 or 6. successive changes from negative to positive, and from positive to negative the Bells stopping a minute or two between every Change.

Collison as follows : &quot;Since September  
last , having been abroad on two long  
journeys and otherwise much engaged , I  
have made but two observations on the  
positive and negative state of the elec­  
tricity in the clouds. Hut Mr. Kmnor-  
sloy kept hi * rod and bells in gooil order ,  
and lias made many. Once this winter  
the belli rang a longtime during a fall of  
snow , though no thunder was heard nor  
lightning aeon. Sometimes the  
Hashes and cracks of the elec­  
tric matter between boll and  
bell wore so largo and loud as  
to bo hoard all ovnr the house : but by all  
his observations the clouds were con­  
stantly in a negative state till about six  
weeks ago , when ho found them once to  
change in a few minutes from the nega­  
tive to the positive. About a fortnight  
after that ho made another observation  
of the same kind , and last Monday after­  
noon , the wind blowing hard at north­  
east ami veering round to southeast.with  
many thick driving clouds , there were  
live or six changes trom negative to posi­  
tive and from positive to negative , the  
bells stopping a minute or two between  
every change.
