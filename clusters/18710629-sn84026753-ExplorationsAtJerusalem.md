*The Explorations at Jerusalem.**  
  
The first operations were commenced on the western wall, at a point near what is known as Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It receives the name from the fact that it was first discovered by Captain Wilson, who had not the means, however, to prosecute any mining operations. Captain Warren&#x27;s explorations proved this arch to be one of a series forming a viaduct which led from the Temple toward the palace of Herod on the western hill, and constituting perhaps the very bridge across which Jesus was conducted from Pilate to Herod on the day of his trial. The remains of a winding aqueduct, cut in the solid rock beneath this bridge, were also discovered. Part of this bridge has fallen, and broken and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and the original pavement of the ancient road in the valley itself is forty-five feet below the present surface formed by the ruins of the ancient wall and houses. Nor is this all. A perfect net-work of subterranean chambers was also disclosed, some of which were probably used for the storage of food, and others as aqueducts and cisterns. And the whole result more than confirms the ideas of Jewish architectural grandeur which the books of the Bible and the pages of Josephus combined to give, but which have hitherto been regarded by many skeptical minds as apocryphal.  
  
Along the southern wall his discoveries were scarcely less interesting. Here he found a double pavement, one twenty-three, the other forty-three feet below the present surface of the ground. Here also he found some curious remains both of Hebrew and of Christian origin. The following description of his explorations at this point, taken from one of his letters written at the time, will afford the reader a more graphic picture of the difficulties and dangers which attended his investigations than can be given by any general description:  
  
&quot;On Friday, having arrived at a depth of seventy-nine feet, the men were breaking up a stone at the bottom of the shaft. Suddenly the ground gave way, down went the stone and the hammer, the men barely saving themselves. They at once rushed up, and told the sergeant they had found the bottomless pit. I went down to the spot and examined it; and, in order that you may have an idea of the extent of our work, I will give you a description of our descent.  
  
&quot;The shaft mouth is on the south side of the Sanctuary wall, near the southwest angle, among the prickly-pears; beside it, to the east, lying against the Sanctuary wall, is a large mass of rubbish that has been brought up; while over the mouth itself is a triangular gin, with iron wheel attached, with guy, for running up the excavated soil. Looking down the shaft, one sees that it is lined for the first twenty feet with frames four feet six inches in the clear; further down the Sanctuary wall and soil cut through are seen, and a man standing at what appears to be the bottom. An order is given to this man, who repeats it, and then, faintly, is heard a sepulchral voice answering, as it were, from another world. Reaching down tot he man who is visible is a thirty-four-feet rope-latter; and, on descending by it, one finds he is standing on a ledge which the ladder does not touch by four feet. This ledge is a top of a wall running north and south, and abutting on she Sanctuary wall; its east face just cuts the centre of the shaft, which has to be canted off about two feet toward the east, just where some large loose stones jut out in the most disagreeable manner. Here five more frames have been fixed to keep these stones steady. On peering down from this ledge one sees the Sanctuary wall, with its projecting courses, until they are lost in the darkness below; observing also, at the same time, that two sides of the shaft are cut through the soil and are self-supporting. Now to descend this second drop the ladder is again required; accordingly, having told the man at the bottom to get under cover, it is lowered to the ledge, from whence it is found that it does not reach to the bottom by several feet. It is therefore lowered to the the required distance, and one has to reach it by climbing down hand over hand for about twelve feet. On passing alone one notes the marvelous joints of the Sanctuary wall stones, and also, probably, gets a few blows on skull and knuckles from falling pebbles. Just on reaching the bottom one recollects there is still a pit of unknown depth to be explored, and cautiously straddle across it. Then can be seen that one course in the Sanctuary wall, near the bottom, is quite smooth all over, the stone being finely dressed, around the drafts; one also sees two stout boards lying against the Santuary wall, under which the men retire whenever an accidental shower of stones renders their position dangerous. One is now at a depth of seventy-nine feet from the surface, and from here we commence the exploring of the &#x27;bottomless pit.&#x27; After dropping a rope down, we found that it was only six feet deep, though it looked black enough for any thing.&quot;  
  
Further explorations disclosed a subterranean passage, perhaps orginally constructed to carry off the overflow from the Temple; and the intrepid investigator crawled on his hands and feet 400 feet along the slimy drain through the mud, the passage at times becoming so narrow that he could barely squeeze through, and the air so foul as to threaten suffocation. The difficulty of his position is indicated by the fact that he had to back out 200 feet before he could get to a point where he could turn his head.—From &quot;The Recovery of Jerusalem,&quot; by Lyman Abbott, in *Harper&#x27;s Magazine* for July.

Having arrived at a depth of 79 feet, th  
men were brealing up a stone at the bottom  
of the shalt. Suddenly the ground gave  
way, down went the stone and the hammer,  
the men  arely saving themselves. They at  
once rushed up and told the sergeant they  
had found the bottomless pit. I went down  
to the spot and examined it, and, in order  
that you may have an idea of the extent of  
 our work, I will give you a description of our  
descent,  
The shaft mouth is on the south side of the  
Haram Wall, near the southwest angel,  
among the prickly pears; beside it, to the­  
east, lving against the Haram Wall, is a large  
mass of rubbish that has been brought up,  
while over the mouth itself is a triangular  
gin, with iron wheel attached, with guy for  
running up the excavated soll. Looking  
down the shaft, one sees that it is lined for  
the first twenty feet with frames ift oin, in  
the clear. Further down the Haram Wall  
nd cut through is seen, and a man standing  
in what appears to be the bottom. An order  
is given to this man, who repeats it,  
and then faintly is heard a sepulchral  
voice answering, as it were from  
another world. Reaching down to the  
man who is visible is a 3ift, rope ladder,  
and on descending by it one finds he is  
 standing on a ledge which the ladder does  
not touch by four feet. This ledge is onfthe  
 edge of a wall ruming north and south and  
abutting on the Lar wal its ei fa  
just cuts the centre of the haft, which has to  
canted off about two feet towards the  
east, just where some latge, loose stones jut  
out in the most disagrecable manner. Hett  
five more trames nave been fixed to keep  
these siones steady. On peering down from  
this ledg one sees the Baram wall with its  
projecting cour as until they are lost in the  
darkness below, observing, also, at the same  
time, that two sides of the shait are cutting  
through the soil, and are relf-supportle  
Now, to descend this secend drop the ladder  
is again required; accordingly, having told  
the man at the bottem to get under cover, it  
is lowered to the ledge, whence it 1s found  
that it does not reach to the bottom by  
sexeral fest. It ts theref re lowrred the ig  
distance, and one has to reach it by  
chimbing down hand over hand for about  
twelve feet. On passing along one notes the  
marvellous joints of the Haram Wall stones,  
and also, probably, gets a few blows on skull  
and knuckles from falling pebbles. Just  
on reaching the bottom, one fecollects that  
there is and a pit of unkown depth to be  
explored, and cantiously straddles across it  
Then can be seen that one course in the Ha­  
ram Wall, near the bottom, is quite smooth  
all over, the stone being fincly dreated, all  
other courses being only well dreased round  
the dratta; one also sees two stout boards  
lying against the Haram Wall, under which  
the men retire whenever an accidental  
shower of atones renders their po ition dan  
gerons. One is now at a depth of seventy­  
aine feet fom the surface, and from here we  
commence the exploration of the &quot;bottom­

found that it was only sixty-five feet deep,

‘On Friday, having arrived at a depth of 79 feet, the men were  
breaking up a stone at the bottom of the shaft. Suddenly, the ground  
gave way, down went the stone and the hammers, the men barely  
saving themselves. They at once rushed up and told the serjeant

our work, I will give a description of our descent.  
  
‘¢ The shaft-mouth is on the south side of the Haram wall, near the  
south-west angle, among the prickly pears. Beside it, to the east,  
lying against the Haram wall, is a large mass of rubbish that has been  
brought up, whilst over the mouth itself is a triangular gin, with iron

ing down the shaft, one sees that it is lined for the first 20 feet with

great depth of 79 feet, and the men were in the  
act of breaking through a great stone, in order to  
carry the shaft down still deeper, when suddenly  
the bottom of the shaft gave way. Down went  
stone and hammers, and the Arab workmen  
barely succeeded in saving themselves from  
following with them. They at once rushed up  
and told the sergeant that they had found a  
bottomless pit. Lieutenant Warren. himself-went  
down to examine into. the true nature of the  
sudden and unexpected addition to the depth of  
his shaft, and, in his report on this occasion, he  
says, in order that we may have an idea.of the  
nature and magnitude of his work, he will give  
  
us a description of his descent of the shaft on},  
  
this 11th day of last October :—  
  
“The shaft-mouth is on the south side of the  
Haram wall, near the south-west angle,” writes  
Lieutenant Warren, “among the prickly pears.  
Beside it, to the east, lying against the wall, is  
a large mass of rubbish that has been..brought  
up; while over the mouth of the shaft itself is  
a triangular gin,.with.an iron wheel:attached,  
and with a guy for running. up, the. excavated  
soil. Looking down the shaft,-I see that it is  
lined for the first 20 feet with timber framing  
4 feet 6 inches in the clear. Further down, :the  
Haram wall is seen, and the soil which has been  
cut through, and a man appears standing at what  
apparently is the bottom., An order is,given) to  
this man, who repeats. it, and then, a.sepulchral  
voice is heard answering faintly, »as .if\:from  
another world. . Reaching down,towards the man  
who is visible is, a 84-feeb..nope-ladder; and on  
descending by it, I find,that the: man, #g-standing  
on a ledge which. ler. does not’ touch by  
4 feet. This ‘eden . of the wall running

The east face of this.wall just cuts, the: centre.of  
the shaft, whieh;,;consequently,..has «to; beveanted  
off about 2 feet towards the east, just where some  
large loose stones jut out in the most disagreeable  
manner. Here five more of the timber frames  
have been fixed to keep these stones steady. On  
peering down from this ledge, the Haram wall is  
discovered, and its grand projecting courses of  
masonry become lost in the darkness still lower  
down; and, at the same time, it becomes evident  
  
  
  
and are self-supporting. In order to descend thig  
second stage of the shaft, the ladder is again re-  
  
quired. Accordingly, having told the man at the ~  
  
bottom to get under cover, the ladder is lowered  
to the ledge, and then, since it does not reach the  
bottom of the shaft, it has to be lowered about  
twelve feet more, and I have to reach it by climb-  
ing down by a rope hand over hand. As I pass  
along, I observe the marvellous joints of the Haram  
wall, and also probably encounter a few blows on  
the head and knuckles from falling pebbles. At  
last, on reaching the bottom of the ladder, I re.  
member that there is still a pit of unknown depth  
to be explored, and so I step cautiously over the  
aperture leading to it. Then can be seen that one  
course of the Haram wall, near its base, is quite  
smooth all over, the stone being finely dressed, all  
the other eourses being well dressed only round  
their drafts (or sunk borders). Two stout boards  
alsovare here seen lying against the Haram wall,  
under which the men retire whenever an acci-  
dental shower of stones renders their position  
dangerous. I am now at the depth of seventy.  
nine fect from the surface, and here I commence  
my exploration, of the ‘ bottomless pit.’ Having  
dropped a rope down into it, I&gt; discover that it  
really is only six feet deep, though certainly it  
looked black enough for anything. On.climbin

ThE ExPLORATIONS Ar JERUSALEM.  
The first operations were commenced on  
  
the western wall, at a point near what is  
known as Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It receives  
this name from the fact that it was first  
discovered by Captain Wilson, who had  
not the means, however, to prosecute any  
mining operations. Captain Warren&#x27;s  
explorations proved this arch to be one  
of a series forming a viaduct which led  
from the Temple toward the palace of  
Herod on the western hill, and constitut­  
ing perhaps the very bridge across which  
Jesus was conducted from Pilate to Herod  
  
on the day of his trial. The remains of  
  
a winding aqueduct, cut in the solid rock  
beneath this bridge, were also discovered.  
Part of this bridge has fallen, and broken

Tlic Exploration* at Jerusalem.  
The tirst operations were commenced on the  
vestern wall, at a point near what is known as  
Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It receives tho name from the  
act that it was tirst discovered by Captain  
Wilson, who had not the means, however, to  
prosecute any mining operations. Captain  
Warren&#x27;s explorations proved this arch to be  
&gt;ne of a series forming a viaduct which led j  
&#x27;rem the Temple toward the palace of Herod  
&gt;n the western hillt and constituting perhaps  
he very bridge across which Jesus was conluctcd  
from Pilate to Ilerod on the day of his  
rial. The remains of a winding aqueduct, cut,  
n the solid rock beneath this bridge, were also !  
li8oovered. Part of this bridge has fallen, and  
iroken and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and  
;he original pavement of the ancient road in  
:he valley itself is forty-five feet below the pres  
;nt surface formed by the ruins of the ancieut  
ivalls and bouses. Nor is this all. A perfect  
jet-work of subterranean chambers was also  
iisclosed, some of which were probably used  
&quot;or the storage of food, and others as aqueducts  
irid cisterns. And the whole result more than ,  
;onfirms the ideas of Jewish architectural  
grandeur which the books of the Bible and the  
jages of Josephus combined to give, but which i  
jave hitherto been regarded by many skeptical  
liinds as apocryphal.  
Along the southern wall his discoveries were :  
jcarcely less interesting. Here he found a  
loukle pavement, one tweuty-three, the other &#x27;  
&#x27;orty-three feet below the present surface of  
the ground. Here also he found some curious  
  
remains both of Hebrew and of Christian origin. :  
1&#x27;he following description of bis explorations at  
:his point, takeu from one of his letters writeu  
at the time, will afford the reader a more  
graphic picture of the difficulties and dangers  
which attended his investigations than can be  
$iven by any general description :  
&quot; Ou Friday, having arrived at a depth of!&#x27;  
leventy-nine feet, the uien were breaking up a :  
itoue at the bottom of the shaft. Suddenly the  
ground gave way, down went the stone and the  
maimer, the men barely saving themselves,  
fhey at once rushedjup, and told the sergeant  
hey had found the bottomless pit. I went  
iown to the spot and examined it; and, in orier  
that you may have an idea of the extent of  
)ur work, 1 will give you a description of our  
lescent.  
44 The shaft mouth is on the south side of  
.he Sanctuary wall, near the southwest angle,  
unong the prickly pears; beside it, to the east,  
lying against the Sanctuary wall, is a large  
mass of rubbish that has been brought up ;  
while over the tuouth itself is a triangular gin,  
with iron wheel attached, with guy, for running  
ip the excavated soil. Looking down the shaft,  
one sees that it is lined for the first twenty feet i  
with frames four feet six inches in the clear ; i  
further down the Sanctuary wall and soil cut  
through are seen, and a man standing at what  
ippeurs to be the bottom. An order is given ;  
to this man, who repeats it, and then, faintly,  
is heard a sepulchral voice answering, as it  
were, from another world. Reachiug down to  
the man who is visible is a thirty-four feet t opeladder  
; and, on descending by it,|one finds he is  
itanding ou a ledge which the ladder does not  
touch by four feet. This ledge is a top of a  
wall running north and south, and abutting on  
*he Sanctuary wall ; its east face just cuts the  
:cntre of the shaft, which has to be canted off j  
sbout two feet toward the east, just where some I  
large loose stones jut out in the most disagreeable  
manner, liere five more frames have been  
Qxed to keep these stones steady. On peering

lost in the darkness below ; observing also, at  
the same time, that two sides of the shaft are  
cut through the soil,aand are self-surpporting.  
Now to descend this second drop the ladder is  
again required; accordingly, having told the  
man at the bottom to get under cover, it is  
lowered to the Ledge, from whence it is found  
that it does not reach to the l&gt;ottom by several  
feet. It is therefore lowered to the required  
distance, and one has to reach it by climbing

ered by the detritus of centuries. The  
first operations were commenced on the  
western wall, at a point near what is  
known as Wilson&#x27;s arch. It receives this  
name from the fact that it was first dis­  
covered by Captain Wilson, who had not  
the means to prosecute any mining oper­  
ations. Captain Warren&#x27;s explorations  
proved this arch to be one of a series  
forming a viaduct which led from the  
Temple toward the palace of Herod, on  
the western hill, and constituting perhaps  
the very bridge across which Jesus was  
conducted from Pilate to Herod on the  
day of his trial. The remains of a wind­  
ing aqueduct, cut in the solid rock be­  
neath the bridge, were also discovered.  
Part of the bridge has fallen and broken  
and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and  
the original pavement of the ancient  
road in the valley itself is now forty-five  
feet below the present surface formed by  
the ruins of ancient walls. A perfect  
network of subterranean chambers was  
also disclosed, some of which were pro­  
bably used for the storage of food, and  
others as aqueducts and cisterns. Along  
the southern wall Captain Warren found  
a double pavement, one twenty-three, the  
other forty-three feet below the present  
surface of the ground. Here he also  
found some curious remains both of He­  
brew and Christian origin.  
At a depth of seventy-nine feet from  
the present surface he commenced the ex­  
ploration of what was called the bottom­  
less pit, which, upon investigation, was  
found to be six feet deep. Upon entering  
it there was disclosed a subterranean pas­  
sage, perhaps originally constructed to  
carry off the overflow from the temple,  
and the intrepid investigator crawled on  
his hands and feet four hundred feet  
along this slimy drain through the mud,  
the passage, at times, becoming so narrow  
that he could barely squeeze through, and

The Exploration of Jerusalem.  
Tho first operations wero commcnccd on  
tho western wall, at a point near what is  
known as Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It receives this  
name from the fact that it was first discov­  
ered by Captain Wilson, who liad not tho  
means, however, to jimsocutc any mining  
operations. Captain Warren&#x27;s explora­  
tion proved this arch to bo one of a scries  
forming a viaduct which led from the  
Temple toward tho palace of Herod on tho  
western hill, and constituting perhaps tho  
very bridge across which Jesus was con­  
ducted from l&#x27;ilate to Herod on the day of  
his trial. Tho remains of a winding aq­  
ueduct, cut in tho solid rock beneath this  
singular bridgo, wero also discovered.?  
l&#x27;art of this bridgo has fallen, and broken  
aud buried the aqueduct iu its fall; and the  
original pavement of tho ancieut road in  
the valley itself is now forty-fivo feet bo­  
low the present surface formed by the ru­  
ins of the anoicnt walls and houses. Nor  
is this all. A perfect net-work of subter­  
ranean chambers was also disclosed, somo  
of which were probably used for^ho stor­  
age of food, and others as nqucducts and  
cistcrns. And tho whole result more than  
confirms tho ideas of architectural gran­  
deur which the books of the Iliblo and tho  
pages of Joscphus combined to givo, but  
which have hitherto been regarded by ma­  
ny skeptical minds as apocryphal.  
Along the southern wall his discoveries  
wero scarcely less interesting. Here ho  
found a double pavement, one twenty-three  
aud the other forty-thrca foot below tho  
present surface of the ground. Iloro also  
ho found somo curious remains both Of He­  
brew and of Christian origin. Tho fol­  
lowing description of his explorations at  
this point, taken from ono of his letters  
written at the time, will afford tho reader  
a more graphic picturo of tho difficulties  
and danger which attended his investiga­  
tions than can bo given by any general  
description:  
&quot;On Friday, have arrived at a depth of  
seventy-nino feet, tiic men wero breaking  
up a stone at tho bottom of tho shaft.?  
Suddenly the ground gavo way, down  
went tho stone and tho hammer, tlio men  
barely saving themselves. They at once  
bjr  
found tho bottomless pit. I wcut down to  
the spot and examined it; and, in order  
that you may have an idea of tho extent of  
our woik, I will give you a description of  
our descent.  
&#x27;The shaft mouth is on the south-sido  
of the Guticlnary wall, near tho southwest  
angle, among tho prickly-pears; besido it,  
to the cast, lving against tho Sanctuary I  
wall, is a largo mass of rubbish that has  
been brought up; while over the mouth it­  
self is a triangular gin, with iron-wheel at­  
tached, with guy, for running up tho ex­  
cavated soil. Looking down tho shaft, ono  
sees that it is lined for tho first twenty  
feet with frames four feet six inohes in tho  
clcar; further down tho Sanctuary wall and  
soil cut through arc seen, and a man stand­  
ing at the bottom. An order is given to  
this man, who repeats it, and then faintly,  
is heard a sepulchral voice answering, as  
it were from another world, ltcnching  
down to the man who is visible is a thirty­  
four feet rope Jaddcr; aud on descending  
by it, ono finds he is standing on a ledge  
which the ladder does not touch by four  
feet. This ledge is tho top of a wall run­  
ning north and south, and abutting on tho  
Sanctuary wall; its east face just cuts the  
centre of tho shaft, which has to bo canted  
oil about two feet toward the cast, just  
where some large looso stones jut out in  
the most disagreoablo manner. Hero five  
more frames have been fixed to keep these  
stones steady. On peering down from this  
ledge one sees tho Sanctuary wall, with its  
projecting courses, until they are lost in  
the darkness below; observing also, at tho  
same time, that two sides of the shaft arc  
cut through the soil, and aro self-support­  
ing. Now to deseend this second drop  
the ladder is again required; accordingly  
having told the man at the bottom to get  
under cover, it is lowered to tho ledge,  
from whenco it is found that it docs not  
rcach to tho bottom by several feet. It is  
therefore lowered to tho required distance,  
and ono has to reach it by climbiug down  
hand over hand for about twelve feet. On  
passing along ono notices tho marvelous  
joints of tie Sanctuary wall stones, and  
also, probably, gets a few blows on skull  
and knuckles from falling pebbles. Just  
on reaching the bottom one recollects there  
is still a pit of unknown depth to bo ex­  
plored, and cautiously straddles across it.  
Then can be seen that one courso in the  
Sanctuary wull, ucar the bottom, is quite  
smooth all over, tho stone being finely  
dressed, all other courses being only well  
dressed around the drafts; one aliio uccu two  
  
| stout boards lying against l&#x27;10 Sanctuary  
wall, under wbioh the men rotiro whenev­

surface, and from hero wo ooimnonoo

pit.&quot; After dropping a ropo down, wo  
found that it was only six feet deep, though  
it looked black enough for anything.

tho passage at times becoming so narrow

The explorations at Jeri  
SALEINE.  
The first operations were commenced  
on the western wall, at a point near  
what is known as Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It re­  
ceives this name from the fact that it  
was first discovered by Captain Wilson,  
who had not the means, however, to  
prosecute any mining eperations. Cap­  
tain Warren&#x27;s explorations proved this  
arch to be one of a series forming a via­  
duct which led from the Temple toward  
the palace of Herod on the western hill,  
and constituting perhaps the very bridge  
across which Jesus was conducted fron  
Pilate to Herod on the day of his trial.  
The remains of a winding aqueduct, cut  
in the solid rock beneath this bridge,  
were also discovered. Part of this  
bridge has fallen, and broken and buried  
the aqueduct in its fall; and the origl­  
nal pavement of the ancient road in the  
valley itself is now forty-five feet below  
the present surface formed by the ruins  
of the ancient walls and houses. Nor is  
this all. A perfect net-work of subter­  
rancan chambers was also disclosed,  
some of which were probably used for  
the storage of food, and others as aque­  
ducts and cisterns. And the whole re­  
sult more than confirms the ideas of  
Jewish architectural grandeur which  
the books of the Bible and the pages of  
Josephus combined to give, but which  
have hitherto been regarded by many  
skeptical minds as apocryphal.  
Along the southern wall his discov­  
cries were scarcely less interesting.  
Here he found a double pavement, one  
twenty-three, the other forty-three feet  
below the present surface of the ground.  
Here also he found some curious re­  
mains both of Hebrew and of Christian  
origin. The following description of  
his explorations at this point, taken  
from one of his letters written at the  
time, will afford the reader a more  
graphic picture of the difficulties and  
dangers which attended his investiga  
tions than can be given by any general  
description:  
&quot;On Friday, having arrived at a  
depth of seventy-nine feet, the men  
were breaking up a stone at the bottom  
of the shaft. Suddenly the ground gave  
way, down went the stone and the ham­  
mer, the men barely saving themselves.  
They at once rushed up, and told the  
sergeant they had found the bottomless  
pit. I went down to the spot and ex­  
amined it; and, in order that you may  
have an idea of the extent of our work,  
I will give a description of our descent,  
&quot;The shaft mouth is on the south side  
of the Sanctuary wall, near the south­  
west angle, among the prickly-pears;  
beside it, to the east, lying against the  
Sanctuary wall, is a large mass of rub­  
bish that has been brought up; while  
over the mouth itself is a triangular  
gin, with iron wheel attached, with guy,  
for running up the excavated soil.  
Looking down the shaft, one sees that  
it is lined for the first twenty feet with  
frames four feet six inches in the clear:  
further down the Sanctuary wall and  
soll cut through are seen, and a man  
standing at what appears to be the bot­  
tom. An order is given to this man,  
who repeats it, and then, faintly, is  
heard a sepulchral voice answering, as  
it were from another world. Reaching  
down to the man who is visible is a  
thirty-four-feet rope-ladder; and on de­  
scending by it, one finds he is standing  
on a ledge which the ladder does not  
touch by four feet. This ledge is the  
top of a wall running north and south,  
and abutting on the Sanctuary wall; its  
east face just cuts the centre of the shaft,  
which has to be canted off about two  
feet toward the east, just where some  
large loose stones jut out in the most  
disagreeable manner. Here five more  
frames have been fixed to keep these  
stones steady. On peering down from this  
ledge one sees the Sanctuary wall, with  
its projecting courses, until they are lost  
in the darkness below; observing also,  
at the same time, that two sides of the  
shaft are cut through the soil, and are  
self-supporting. Now to descend this  
second drop the ladder is again re­  
quired; accordingly, having told the  
man at the bottom to get under cover,  
it is lowered to the ledge, from whenee  
it is found that it does not reach to  
the bottom by several feet. It is there­  
fore lowered to the required distance,  
and one has to reach it by climbing down  
hand over hand for about twelve feet.  
On passing along one notes the marvel­  
ous joints of the Sanctuary wall stones,  
and also, probably, gets a few blows on  
skull and knuckles from falling pebbles.  
Just on reaching the bottom one recol­  
lects there is still a pit of unkown depth  
to be explored, and cautiously straddles  
across it. Then can be seen that one  
course in the Sanctuary wall, near the  
bottom, is quite smooth all oyer, the  
stone being finely dressed, all other  
courses being only well-dressed around  
the drafts; one also sees two stout  
boards lying against the Sanctuary wall,  
under which the men retire whenever  
an accidental shower of stones renders  
their position dangerous. One is now at a  
depth of seventy-nine feet from the sur-  
face, and from here we commence the  
exploring of the &quot;bottomless pit.&quot;  
After dropping a rope down, we found  
that it was only six feet deep, though it  
looked black enough for any thing.&quot;  
Further explorations disclosed a sub  
terranean passage, perhaps originally  
constructed to carry off the overflow  
from the Temple; and the intrepid in­  
vestigator crawled on his hands and feet  
400 feet along this slimy drain through  
the mud, the passage at times becoming  
so narrow that he could barely squeeze  
through, and the air so foul as to threat  
en suffocation. The difficulty of his po  
sition is indicated by the fact that he  
had to back out 200 feet before he could  
get to a point where he could turn his  
head.-Harper&#x27;s Nagasine,
