HOW TO MAKE WATER COLD WITHOUT ICE.--The following description of a method of rendering water almost as cold as ice, has been going the rounds of the press for many years. Just now it is again &quot;in season,&quot; and we copy it for the benefit of those of our readers who either have not the opportunity or the inclination to purchase ice:  
  
&quot;Let the jar, pitcher, or vessel used for water, be surrounded with one or more folds of coarse cotton, to be constantly wet. The evaporation of the water will carry off the heat from the inside, and reduce it to freezing point. In India and other tropical climes, where ice cannot be procured, this is common. Let every mechanic and laborer have at his place of employment two pitches thus provided and with lids and covers, one to contain fresh water for drinking, the other for evaporation, and he can always have a supply of cold water in warm weather.&quot;

Coot Water. At this season of the year a  
cool draught of water is a luxury which we may  
enjoy with a little care. By the fullowing meth-  
od, simple and inexpensive, water may be kept  
almost as cold as ice. Let the jar, pitcher or  
vessel used for water, be surrounded with one or  
more folds of coarse cotton, to be constantly wet;  
the evaporation of the water will carry off the  
heat from the inside, and reduce it to a low tem-  
perature. In India and other tropical countries,  
where ice cannot be procured, this expedient is  
jcommon. Let every mechanic and laborer have  
jat the place of his work two pitehers thus pro-  
| vided, and with lids or covers, one to contain  
  
fresh water for drinking, the other for evapora-  
|tion, and he can always have asupply of cold  
| water in warm weather. Any person may test  
| this by dipping a finger in water, and holding it  
in the air on a warm day ; after doing this three  
| or four times, he will find his finger uncomfortably  
|cool. This plan will save the bill for ice, besides  
| being more healthful. The free use of ice water  
often produces derangement of the internal organs,  
which, we conceive, is due toa property of the  
, water independent of its coldness.

How to Cool Water.—As the warm

draught of water becomes a luxury  
which we may enjoy with a little care.  
By the following method, simple and  
inexpensive, water may be kept almost  
as cold as ice. Let a jar, pitcher or  
vessel used for water, be surrounded  
with one or more folds of coarse cotton  
tobe constantly wet; the evaporation

and with lids or covers, one to furnish  
water for the evaporation, and he can  
always have, a supply of cool water in

this by dipping a finger in water and
