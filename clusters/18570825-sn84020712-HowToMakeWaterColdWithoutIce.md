HOW TO MAKE WATER COLD WITHOUT ICE.--The following description of a method of rendering water almost as cold as ice, has been going the rounds of the press for many years. Just now it is again &quot;in season,&quot; and we copy it for the benefit of those of our readers who either have not the opportunity or the inclination to purchase ice:  
  
&quot;Let the jar, pitcher, or vessel used for water, be surrounded with one or more folds of coarse cotton, to be constantly wet. The evaporation of the water will carry off the heat from the inside, and reduce it to freezing point. In India and other tropical climes, where ice cannot be procured, this is common. Let every mechanic and laborer have at his place of employment two pitches thus provided and with lids and covers, one to contain fresh water for drinking, the other for evaporation, and he can always have a supply of cold water in warm weather.&quot;
