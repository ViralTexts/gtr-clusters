London, Nov. 3. 1772  
I received your Favour of June 22d per Mr. Finlay, and shall be glad of an Opportunity of rendring him any Service on your Recommendation. There does not at present seem to be any Disposition of the Board to appoint a Riding Surveyor, nor does Mr. Finlay seem desirous of such an Employment. Every thing at the Office remains as when I last wrote, only the Impatience for the Accounts seems increasing. I hope they are in the October Packet now soon expected, agreable to Mr. Colden’s last Promises.  
  
I spent a Fortnight lately at West Wyecomb, with our good Master Lord Le Despencer, and left him well.  
The Boards have begun to act again, and I hope our Ohio Business will again go forward. My Love to my Daughter, concludes from Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant

of an opportunity of rendering him any service on your Recommendation. There  
does not at present appear to’be any Disposition in the Board to appoint a  
Riding Surveyor, nor does Mr. Finlay seem desirous of such an Employment.  
Everything at the Office remains as when I last wrote only the Impatience for  
the Accounts seems increasing. 1 hope they are in the October Packet now  
soon expected agreeable to Mr. Colden’s last promise.

Despencer and left him well.  
  
The Board has begun to act again and I hope our Business will again go  
forward.
