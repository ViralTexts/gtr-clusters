A Good Wife  
  
Is to man, *wisdom* and *courage* and *strength*. No condition is hopeless, when the wife possesses firmness, decision, energy and economy. Man is strong, but his heart is not adamant. He delights in enterprise and action, but to sustain him, he needs a tranquil mind and a whole heart. He expends his whole moral force in the conflicts of the world. His feelings are daily lacerated to the utmost point of endurance, by perpetual collision, irritation and disappointment. To recover his equaniminty and composure, *home* must be to him, a place of repose, of peace, cheerfulness, of comforts; and his soul renews its strength, and again goes forth with fresh vigor, to encounter the labors and troubles of the world. Let woman know then, that she ministers at the very countain of life and happiness. Her ardent spirit breathes the breath of life into all her enterprises. Her patience and constancy are mainly instrumental in carrying out to completion the best human de

THE GOOD WIFE.  
How much of this world&#x27;s happiness and  
prosperity is contained in the compass of  
these two short words! Her influence in  
immense. The power of a wife, for good or  
evil, is altogether irresistable. Home must  
be the seat of happiness, or it must be for  
erer unknown. A good wife is to a man  
wisdom, and courage, and strength, and  
hope, and endurance; a bad one is confu­  
sion, weakness, discomfiture, and despair.  
No condition is hopeless when the wife  
possesses firmness, decision, energy and  
economy. There is no outward prosperi­  
ty which can counteract indolence, folly  
and extravagance at home. No spirit can  
ong resist bad domestic influence. Man  
is strong, but his heart is not adamant.  
He delights in enterprise and action; but  
to sustain him, he needs a tranquil mind  
and a whole heart. He expends his whole  
moral force in the conflicts of the world  
His feelings are lacerated to the utmost  
point of endurance by perpetual collisions  
and disappointment. To recover his equa­  
nimity and composure, home must be to  
him a place of repose, of peace, of cheer­  
fulness, of comfort; and his soul renews  
its strength, and again goes forth with  
fresh vigor to encounter the labor and  
froubles of the world. But if at home he  
finds no rest, and there is met with bad  
temper, sullenness, or gloom, or is assail­  
ed by discontent, complaint, and reproach­  
es, the heart breaks, the spirits are crush-  
ed, hope vanishes, and the man sinks into  
total despair.
