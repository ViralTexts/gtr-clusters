I wrote to you yesterday relating to the Affair of your Letter to Mr Carmichael that you might know exactly the Truth of the Transaction. On Reflection I think it proper to add, that what I wrote was for your Satisfaction only; and that as the making it publick would give infinite Pain to a very worthy Man, Mr. F. Grand, who would then appear in the Light of Delateur de son Frere; &amp; it can serve no other Purpose but that of Vengeance on Sir George, and be of no Advantage to you, I must insist on your Generosity in keeping it a Secret to yourself. In this you will also very much oblige me, who would by no means have my Name publickly mention’d on this Occasion; and I depend on your Compliance. With great Esteem, I am ever, Dear Sir Your most obedt. huml Servt

Dear Sir.  
  
I wrote to you yesterday relating to the Affair  
of your Letter to M&#x27; Carmichael that you might  
know Exactly the Truth of the Transaction. On  
Reflection I think it proper to add, that what I  
wrote was for your Satisfaction only; and that  
as the making it publick would give infinite  
Pain to a very worthy Man, Mr. F. Grand: who  
would then appear in the Light of Delateur de  
Son Frere; &amp; it can serve no other Purpose but  
that of Vengeance on Sir George, and be of no  
Advantage to you I must insist on your Gener-  
osity in keeping it a Secret to yourself— In this  
you will also very much oblige, who would by  
no means have my Name publickly mention’d on  
this Occasion ; and I depend on your Compliance.  
  
With great Esteem I am Ever Dear Sir  
  
Your most obed’ hum! Serv‘
