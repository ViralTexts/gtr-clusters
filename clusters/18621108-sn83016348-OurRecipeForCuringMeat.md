Our Recipe for Curing Meat.  
  
To one gallon of water,  
  
Take 1 1/2 lbs. of salt,  
  
1/2 lb. of sugar,  
  
1/2 oz. of saltpeter,  
  
1/2 oz. of potash.  
  
In this ratio the pickle to be increased to any quantity desired. Let these be boiled together, until all the dirt from the sugar rises to the top and is skimmed off. Then throw it into a tub to cool, and when _cold_, pour it over your beef and pork, to remain the usual time, say four or five weeks. The meat must be well covered with pickle, and should not be put down for at least two days after killing, during which time it should be slightly sprinkled with powdered saltpeter, which removes all the surface blood, &amp;c., leaving the meat fresh and clean.  
  
Some omit boiling the pickle and find it to answer well; though the operation of boiling purifies the pickle by throwing off the dirt always to be found in salt and sugar.  
  
If this receipt is properly tried, it will never be abandoned. There is none that surpasses it, if so good.—_Ger. Telegraph_.

ing meat:  
In one gallon of water, take 11-2 lbs. of  
salt, 1-2 lb. of sugar, 1-2 oz. of saltpetre, 1-2  
oz. of potash. In this ratio the pickle is to be

sugar rises to the top and is skimmed off.—

recipe for curing beef, pork, mutton, hams,

1 1-2 lbs. of salt, 1-2 Ib. of sugar, 1-2 oz. of  
saltpetre, 1-2.0z. of potash. (Omit the potash  
unless you can get the pure article.  
Druggists usually keep it.) In this ratio the  
pickle can be increased to any quantity  
desired. Let these be boiled together until  
all the dirt from the sugar rises to the top  
and is skimmed off. Then throw it into a  
tub to cool, and when cold, pour it over your  
beef or pork. The meat must be well  
covered with pickle, and should not be put  
down for at least two days after killing,
