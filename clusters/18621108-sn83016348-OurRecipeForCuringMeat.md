Our Recipe for Curing Meat.  
  
To one gallon of water,  
  
Take 1 1/2 lbs. of salt,  
  
1/2 lb. of sugar,  
  
1/2 oz. of saltpeter,  
  
1/2 oz. of potash.  
  
In this ratio the pickle to be increased to any quantity desired. Let these be boiled together, until all the dirt from the sugar rises to the top and is skimmed off. Then throw it into a tub to cool, and when _cold_, pour it over your beef and pork, to remain the usual time, say four or five weeks. The meat must be well covered with pickle, and should not be put down for at least two days after killing, during which time it should be slightly sprinkled with powdered saltpeter, which removes all the surface blood, &amp;c., leaving the meat fresh and clean.  
  
Some omit boiling the pickle and find it to answer well; though the operation of boiling purifies the pickle by throwing off the dirt always to be found in salt and sugar.  
  
If this receipt is properly tried, it will never be abandoned. There is none that surpasses it, if so good.—_Ger. Telegraph_.

”  
For a Sore Throat.—The best remedy we  
have found for a sore throat is, on retiring to  
re&gt;:. to rub on the outside a little Fi laiile  
Liniment, and swallow slowly a few drops of  
paregoric letting it dissolve in the saliva, and  
spread along down the inflamed parts. The  
liniment is generally sufficient alone. Vol­  
atile Linim nit is simply a mixture of sweet  
oil aid aqua ammonia (called liquid harts­  
h irn j. These are put in a vial and shaken,  
using such proportion as to form a semi li­  
quid soap. An ounce or two cun be got  
cheaply at the druggists, and if ti ghtly cork  
ed, it will keep fir months. Rub it with the  
lingers. We find nothing bettor than this for  
- ireaess of the chest or joints, or for lame­  
ness, stiff neck, etc.

&quot;Volatile Liniment,&quot; and swallow a few  
drops of paregoric, letting it dissolve in the  
saliva, ana spread along down the inflamed  
parts. The liniment is generally sufficient  
alone. Volatile Liniment is simply a mix­  
tar* of sweet oil and aqua ammonia, (called  
liquid hartshorn). These are put in a rial  
and shaken, using such proportions as to  
form a semi-liquid soap. An ounce or two  
can be got cheaply at the druggists, and if  
tightly corked it will keep for months. Bub  
it on with the lingers. We find nothing hot

FARM AND FIRESIDE.  
Cckino Meat.—At this season of the  
year the thoughts of almost every farmer  
naturally turning more or less to the proces­  
ses of curing meat for the Winter’s use.—  
Most farmers have a pig or two to salt  
down, and some have mutton or beef, and  
the quality of the meat which is to fnrnish  
food for the family, will depend a good deal  
on the way in which it is cured.  
There are various modes of curing meat,  
but one of the best, perhaps, is that sugges­  
ted by the Germantown Telegraph, which is  
as follows:  
To one gallon ol water, take one and a  
half pornds of salt, half a pouud of sugar,  
half an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of  
potash. In this ratio the pickle to be in­  
creased to any quantity desired. Let these  
be boiled together until all the dirt from the  
sugar arises to the top and is skimmed off.  
Then throw it into a tub to cool, and when  
cold, pour it over your beef or pork, to re­  
main the usual time, say four or five weeks.  
The me..t must be covered with pickle, end  
should not be pu: down for at least two  
days after killing, during which time it  
should bo slightly sprinkled with powdered  
saltpetre, which removes all the surface  
blood, etc., leaving the meat fresh and  
clean. Some omit boiling the pickle, and  
find it to answer well; though the operation  
ot boilin &#x27; purifies the pickle by throwing off  
the din a, ways to be found in salt and su­  
gar.  
If this receipt is properly tried it will  
never be abandoned. There is none that  
surpasses it, if so good.

CurinG MEAT.—At this season of  
the year the thoughts ol almost every  
farmer naturally turn more ov less to  
the processes of curing meat for the  
winter’s use. Most farmers have a pig  
or two to salt down, and some have  
mutton or beef, and the quality of the  
meat which is to furnish food for the  
family will depend a good deal on the  
way in which it is cared. :  
There are various modes of curing  
meat, but one of the best, perhaps,  
that suggested by the Germantown  
Telegraph, is as follows:  
To one gailon of water, take one and  
a half pounds of salt, half a pound of  
sugar, half an ounce of saltpetre, half  
an ounce of potash. In this ratio the  
pickle to be increased to any quantity  
desired. Let these be boiled together  
until.all the dirt from the sugar rises to  
the top and is skimmed off. Then  
throw it into a tub to cool, and when  
cold, pour iy over your beef or 1)01&#x27;1(,1  
1o remain the usnal time, say four or  
five weess. The meat must be well  
covered with pickle, aud should not be  
put down for at least two days after  
killing, during which time it should be  
slightly sprinkled with powdered salt­  
petre which removes all the surface  
blood, etc., leaving the meat fresh and  
clean. Some omit boiling the pickle,  
and find it to answer well; though the  
operation of boiling purifies the pickle  
by tbhrowing off the dirt always to be  
found in salt and sugar.

Most fanners have a pig or two to aais  
down, and same have mutton or beef,  
and the quality of meat which is to fur­  
nish food for the family will depend a  
good deal on the way it is cured.

half an ounce of saltpeter, half an ounce  
of potash. In this ratio the pickle to be  
increased to any quantity desired. Let

be covered with pick la and should not be

killing, during which time it should be  
slightly sprinkled with powdered salt­

RECIPE FOR CURING MEAT.  
  
{Germantown Telegraph. |  
  
As the season has arrived when curing  
meat is in order, we republish as of old, our  
famous recipe for curing beef, pork, mutton,  
hams, etc., as follows: To one gallon of  
water, take 1 1-2 lbs. of salt, 1-2 lb. sugar,  
1-2 oz. saltpetre, 1-2 oz. potash.  
  
In this ratio the pickle can be increased  
to any quantity desired. Let these be boiled  
together until all the dirt from the sugar  
rises to the top and is skimmed off. Then  
throw it into a tub to cool, and when cold,  
pour it over your beef or pork. The meat  
must be well covered with pickle, and should  
not be put down for at least two days after  
killing, during which time it should be  
slightly sprinkled with powdered saltpetre,  
which removes all the surface-blood, etc.,  
leaving the meat fresh and clean. Some  
omit boiling the pickle, and find it to answer  
well, though the operation of boiling purifies  
the pickle by throwing off the dirt always to  
be found in salt and sugar. If this receipt  
is strictly followed, it will require only  
single trial to prove its superiority over the  
common way, or most ways of putting down  
meat, and will not soon be abandoned for  
any other. The meat is unsurpassed for  
sweetness, delicacy and freshness of color

Recipe for Curing Meat.  
As the season has arrived when cur­  
ing meat is in order, we publish as of  
old, our famous recipe for curing beef,  
pork; mutton, hams, etc, as follows: To  
one gallon of water, take 11 lbs, of salt,  
Ilb, sugar, I oz saltpetre. I oz. potash.  
In this ratio the pickle can be increas­  
ed to any quantity desired. Let these  
be boiled together until all the dirt from  
the sugar rises to the top and is skim­  
med off. Then throw it into a tub to  
 cool, and when cold, pour it over your  
beef or pork. The meat must be well  
covered with pickle, and should not he  
put down for at least two days after kill­  
ing, during which time it should be  
slightly sprinkled with powdered salt­  
petre which removes all the surface  
blood, etc, leaving the meat fresh and  
clean. Some omit boiling the pickle,  
and find it to answer well, though the  
eperation of boiling purified the pickle  
by throwing off the dirt always to be  
found in sait and sugar. If this receipt  
is strictly followed, it will require only a  
single trial to prove in superiority over  
the common way, or most ways of put­
