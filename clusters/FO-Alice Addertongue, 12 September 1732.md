Mr. Gazetteer,  
I was highly pleased with your last Week’s Paper upon Scandal, as the uncommon Doctrine therein preach’d is agreeable both to my Principles and Practice, and as it was published very seasonably to reprove the Impertinence of a Writer in the foregoing Thursdays Mercury, who at the Conclusion of one of his silly Paragraphs, laments, forsooth, that the Fair Sex are so peculiarly guilty of this enormous Crime: Every Blockhead ancient and modem, that could handle a Pen, has I think taken upon him to cant in the same senseless Strain. If to scandalize be really a Crime, what do these Puppies mean? They describe it, they dress it up in the most odious frightful and detestable Colours, they represent it as the worst of Crimes, and then roundly and charitably charge the whole Race of Womankind with it. Are they not then guilty of what they condemn, at the same time that they condemn it? If they accuse us of any other Crime, they must necessarily scandalize while they do it: But to scandalize us with being guilty of Scandal, is in itself an egregious Absurdity, and can proceed from nothing but the most consummate Impudence in Conjunction with the most profound Stupidity.  
This, supposing, as they do, that to scandalize is a Crime; which you have convinc’d all reasonable People, is an Opinion absolutely erroneous. Let us leave then these Ideot Mock-Moralists, while I entertain you with some Account of my Life [and] Manners.  
I am a young Girl of about thirty-five, and live at present with my Mother. I have no Care upon my Head of getting a Living, and therefore find it my Duty as well as Inclination, to exercise my Talent at Censure, for the Good of my Country folks. There was, I am told, a certain generous Emperor, who if a Day had passed over his Head, in which he had conferred no Benefit on any Man, used to say to his Friends, in Latin, Diem perdidi, that is, it seems, I have lost a Day. I believe I should make use of the same Expression, if it were possible for a Day to pass in which I had not, or miss’d, an Opportunity to scandalize somebody: But, Thanks be praised, no such Misfortune has befel me these dozen Years.  
Yet, whatever Good I may do, I cannot pretend that I first entred into the Practice of this Virtue from a Principle of Publick Spirit; for I remember that when a Child, I had a violent Inclination to be ever talking in my own Praise, and being continually told that it was ill Manners, and once severely whipt for it, the confin’d Stream form’d itself a new Channel, and I began to speak for the future in the Dispraise of others. This I found more agreable to Company, and almost as much so to my self: For what great Difference can there be, between putting your self up, or putting your Neighbour down? Scandal, like other Virtues, is in part its own Reward, as it gives us the Satisfaction of making our selves appear better than others, or others no better than ourselves.  
My Mother, good Woman, and I, have heretofore differ’d upon this Account. She argu’d that Scandal spoilt all good Conversation, and I insisted that without it there could be no such Thing. Our Disputes once rose so high, that we parted Tea-Table, and I concluded to entertain my Acquaintance in the Kitchin. The first Day of this Separation we both drank Tea at the same Time, but she with her Visitors in the Parlor. She would not hear of the least Objection to any one’s Character, but began a new sort of Discourse in some such queer philosophical Manner as this; I am mightily pleas’d sometimes, says she, when I observe and consider that the World is not so bad as People out of humour imagine it to be. There is something amiable, some good Quality or other in every body. If we were only to speak of People that are least respected, there is such a one is very dutiful to her Father, and methinks has a fine Set of Teeth; such a one is very respectful to her Husband; such a one is very kind to her poor Neighbours, and besides has a very handsome Shape; such a one is always ready to serve a Friend, and in my Opinion there is not a Woman in Town that has a more agreeable Air and Gait. This fine kind of Talk, which lasted near half an Hour, she concluded by saying, I do not doubt but every one of you have made the like Observations, and I should be glad to have the Conversation continu’d upon this Subject. Just at that Juncture I peep’d in at the Door, and never in my Life before saw such a Set of simple vacant Countenances; they looked somehow neither glad, nor sorry, nor angry, nor pleas’d, nor indifferent, nor attentive; but, (excuse the Simile) like so many blue wooden Images of Rie Doe [rye Dough]. I in the Kitchin had already begun a ridiculous Story of Mr. ——’s Intrigue with his Maid, and his Wife’s Behaviour upon the Discovery; at some Passages we laugh’d heartily, and one of the gravest of Mama’s Company, without making any Answer to her Discourse, got up to go and see what the Girls were so merry about: She was follow’d by a Second, and shortly after by a Third, till at last the old Gentlewoman found herself quite alone, and being convinc’d that her Project was impracticable, came her self and finish’d her Tea with us; ever since which Saul also has been among the Prophets, and our Disputes lie dormant.  
By Industry and Application, I have made my self the Center of all the Scandal in the Province, there is little stirring but I hear of it. I began the World with this Maxim, That no Trade can subsist without Returns; and accordingly, whenever I receiv’d a good story, I endeavour’d to give two or a better in the Room of it. My Punctuality in this Way of Dealing gave such Encouragement, that it has procur’d me an incredible deal of Business, which without Diligence and good Method it would be impossible for me to go through. For besides the Stock of Defamation thus naturally flowing in upon me, I practice an Art by which I can pump Scandal out of People that are the least enclin’d that way. Shall I discover my Secret? Yes; to let it die with me would be inhuman. If I have never heard Ill of some Person, I always impute it to defective Intelligence; for there are none without their Faults, no not one. If she is a Woman, I take the first Opportunity to let all her Acquaintance know I have heard that one of the handsomest or best Men in Town has said something in Praise either of her Beauty, her Wit, her Virtue, or her good Management. If you know any thing of Humane Nature, you perceive that this naturally introduces a Conversation turning upon all her Failings, past, present, and to come. To the same purpose, and with the same Success, I cause every Man of Reputation to be praised before his Competitors in Love, Business, or Esteem on Account of any particular Qualification. Near the Times of Election, if I find it necessary, I commend every Candidate before some of the opposite Party, listning attentively to what is said of him in answer: (But Commendations in this latter Case are not always necessary, and should be used judiciously;) of late Years I needed only observe what they said of one another freely; and having for the Help of Memory taken Account of all Informations and Accusations received, whoever peruses my Writings after my Death, may happen to think, that during a certain Term, the People of Pennsylvania chose into all their Offices of Honour and Trust, the veriest Knaves, Fools and Rascals in the whole Province. The Time of Election used to be a busy Time with me, but this Year, with Concern I speak it, People are grown so good natur’d, so intent upon mutual Feasting and friendly Entertainment, that I see no Prospect of much Employment from that Quarter.  
I mention’d above, that without good Method I could not go thro’ my Business: In my Father’s Life-time I had some Instruction in Accompts, which I now apply with Advantage to my own Affairs. I keep a regular Set of Books, and can tell at an Hour’s Warning how it stands between me and the World. In my Daybook I enter every Article of Defamation as it is transacted; for Scandals receiv’d in, I give Credit; and when I pay them out again, I make the Persons to whom they respectively relate Debtor. In my Journal, I add to each Story by Way of Improvement, such probable Circumstances as I think it will bear, and in my Ledger the whole is regularly posted.  
I suppose the Reader already condemns me in his Heart, for this particular of adding Circumstances; but I justify that part of my Practice thus. ’Tis a Principle with me, that none ought to have a greater Share of Reputation than they really deserve; if they have, ’tis an Imposition upon the Publick: I know it is every one’s Interest, and therefore believe they endeavour, to conceal all their Vices and Follies; and I hold, that those People are extraordinary foolish or careless who suffer a Fourth of their Failings to come to publick Knowledge: Taking then the common Prudence and Imprudence of Mankind in a Lump, I suppose none suffer above one Fifth to be discovered: Therefore when I hear of any Person’s Misdoing, I think I keep within Bounds if in relating it I only make it three times worse than it is; and I reserve to my self the Privilege of charging them with one Fault in four, which, for aught I know, they may be entirely innocent of. You see there are but few so careful of doing Justice as my self; what Reason then have Mankind to complain of Scandal? In a general way, the worst that is said of us is only half what might be said, if all our Faults were seen.  
But alas, two great Evils have lately befaln me at the same time; an extream Cold that I can scarce speak, and a most terrible Toothach that I dare hardly open my Mouth: For some Days past I have receiv’d ten Stories for one I have paid; and I am not able to ballance my Accounts without your Assistance. I have long thought that if you would make your Paper a Vehicle of Scandal, you would double the Number of your Subscribers. I send you herewith Account of 4 Knavish Tricks, 2 crackt M—n—ds, 5 Cu-ld-ms, 3 drub’d Wives, and 4 Henpeck’d Husbands, all within this Fortnight; which you may, as Articles of News, deliver to the Publick; and if my Toothach continues, shall send you more; being, in the mean time, Your constant Reader,  
Alice Addertongue  
I thank my Correspondent Mrs. Adddertongue for her Good-Will; but desire to be excus’d inserting the Articles of News she has sent me; such Things being in Reality no News at all.

MSS. OF BENJ. FRANKLIN.*  
  
Mr. Gazetteer,—I was highly pleased with your last  
week’s paper upon ScanDAt, as the uncommon doctrine  
therein preached is agreeable both to my principles and  
practice, and as it was published very seasonably to  
reprove the impertinence of a writer in the foregoing  
Thursday’s Mercury, who, at the conclusion of one of  
his silly paragraphs, laments forsooth that the fair sex  
are so peculiarly guilty of this enormous crime: every  
blockhead, ancient and modern, that could handle a  
pen, has, 1 think, taken upon him to cant in the same  
senseless strain. If to scandalize be really a crime, what  
do these puppies mean? They describe it—they dress  
it up in the most odious, frightful and detestable colors  
—they represent it as the worst of crimes, and then  
roundly and charitably charge the whole race of woman-  
kind with it. Are not they then guilty of what they  
condemn, at the same time that they condemn it? If  
they accuse us of any other crime they must necessa-  
rily scandalize while they do it; but to scandalize us  
with being guilty of scandal, is in itself an egregious  
absurdity, and can proceed from nothing but the most  
consummate impudence in conjunction with the most  
profound stupidity.  
  
This, supposing as they do, that to scandalize is a  
crime; which you have convinced all reasonable people  
is an opinion absolutely erroneous. Let us leave then,  
these select mock-moralists, while 1 entertain you with  
some account of my life and manners,  
  
I am a young girl of about thirty-five, and live at  
present with my mother. I have no care upon my  
head of getting a living, and therefore find it my duty  
as well as inclination to exercise my talent at cENSURE  
for the good of my country folks. There was, I am  
told, a certain generous emperor, who, if a day had  
passed over his head in which he had conferred no  
benefit on any man, used to say to his friends, in Latin,  
Diem perdidi, that is, it seems, I have lost a day. I be-  
lieve I should make use of the same expression, if it  
were possible for a day to pass in which I had not, or  
missed, an opportunity to scandalize somebody: but,  
thanks be praised, no such misfortune has befel me  
these dozen years.  
  
Yet whatever good I may do, I cannot pretend that  
I at first entered into the practice of this virtue from a  
principle of public spirit; for I remember that when a  
child I had a violent inclination to be ever talking in my  
own praise, and being continually told that it was ill-  
manners and once severely whipped for it, the confined  
Stream formed itself a new channel, and I began to  
speak for the future in the dispraise of others, This  
I found more agreeable to company and almost as much  
so to myself: for what great difference can there be  
between putting yourself up or putting your neighbor

down? Scandal, like other virtues, is in part its own  
reward, as it gives us the satisfaction of making our-  
selves appear better than others, or others no better  
than ourselves.  
  
My mother, good woman, and I, have heretofore  
differed upon this account. She argued that Scandal  
spoilt all good conversation, and I insisted that without  
it there would be no such thing. Our disputes once  
rose so high that we parted tea-tables, and I concluded  
to entertain my acquaintance in the kitchen. The first  
day of this separation we both drank tea at the same  
time, but she with her visitors in the parlor. She would  
not hear of the least objection to any one’s character,  
but began a new sort of discourse in some such queer  
philosophical manner as this: I am mightily pleased  
sometimes, says she, when I observe and consider that the  
world is not so bad as people out of humor imagine it to be,  
There is something amiable, some good quality or other in  
every body: If we were only to speak of people that are  
least respected, there is such a one is very dutiful to her  
father, and methinks has a fine set of teeth; such a one is  
very respectful to her husband ; such a one is very kind to  
her poor neighbors, and besides has a very handsome shape ;  
such a one is always ready to serve a friend, and in my  
opinion there is not a woman in town that has a more  
agreeable air or gait.. This fine kind of talk, which  
lasted near half an hour, she concluded by saying, I do  
not doubt but every one of you has made the like observa-  
tions, and I should be glad to have the conversation continu-  
ed upon this subject. Just at this juncture I peeped  
in at the door, and never in my life before saw  
such a set of simple vacant countenances. They  
looked somehow neither glad nor sorry, nor angry nor  
pleased, nor indifferent nor attentive ; but (excuse  
the simile) like so many images of rye dough. I, in  
the kitchen, had already begun a ridiculous story of  
Mr. ’s intrigue with his maid, and his wife’s be-  
havior on the discovery; at some of the passages we  
laughed heartily ; and one of the gravest of mamma’s  
company, without making any answer to her discourse  
got up to go and see what the girls were so merry about :  
she was followed by a second, and shortly by a third,  
till at last the old gentlewoman found herself quite alone,  
and being convinced that her project was impracticable  
came herself and finished her tea with us; ever since  
which Saw also has been among the prophets, and our  
disputes lie dormant.  
  
By industry and application I have made myself the  
centre of all the scandal in the province; there is little  
stirring but I hear of it. I began the world with this  
maxim, that no trade can subsist without returns; and  
accordingly, whenever I received a good story, I en-  
deavored to give two or a better in the room of it,  
My punctuality in this way of dealing gave such en-  
couragement that it has procured me an incredible deal

scandal out of people that are the least inclined that  
way. Shall I discover my secret? Yes; to let it die  
with me would be inhuinan. If I have never heard ill  
of some person I always impute it to defective intelli-  
gence; for there are none without their faults, no, not one.  
If she be a woman, I take the first opportunity to let  
all her acquaintance know I have heard that one of the  
handsomest or best men in town has said something in  
praise either of her beauty, her wit, her virtue, or her  
good management. If you know any thing of human  
nature, you perceive that this naturally introduces a  
conversation turning upon all her failings, past, present  
and tocome. ‘To the same purpose and with the same  
success I cause every man of reputation to be praised  
before his competitors in love, business, or esteem, on  
account of any particular qualification. Near the times  
of election, if I find it necessary, I commend every  
candidate before some of the opposite party, listening  
attentively to what is said of him in answer. But  
commendations in this latter case are not always neces-  
sary and should be used judiciously. Of late years I  
needed only observe what they said of one another  
freely ; and having for the help of memory taken ac-  
count of all informations and accusations received, who-  
ever peruses my writings after my death, may happen  
to think that during a certain time the people of Penn-  
sylvania chose into all their offices of honor and trust,  
the veriest knaves, fools and rascals, in the whole pro-  
vince. The time of election used to be a busy time  
with me, but this year, with concern I speak it, people  
are grown so good natured, so intent upon mutual feast-  
ing and friendly entertainment, that I see no prospect  
of much employment from that quarter.  
  
I mentioned above that without good method I could  
not go through my business. In my father’s life time  
I had some instruction in accounts, which I now apply  
with advantage to my own affairs. I keep a regular  
set of books and can tell at an hour’s warning how it  
stands between me and the world. In my Daybook I  
enter every article of defamation as it is transacted ;  
for scanda!s received in I give credit, and when I pay  
them out again I make the persons to whom they res-  
pectively relate, Debtor. In my Journal, I add to each  
story, by way of improvement, such probable circum-  
stances as I think it will bear, and in my Ledger the  
whole is regularly posted.  
  
I suppose the reader already condemns me in his  
heart for this particular of adding circumstances, but I  
justify this part of my practice thus. It is a principle  
with me that none ought to have a greater share of  
reputation than they really deserve ; if they have, it  
is an imposition upon the public. 1 know it is every  
one’s interest, and therefore believe they endeavor to  
conceal all their vices and follies; and I hold that those  
people are extraordinary foolish or careless, who suffer  
one-fourth of their failings to come to public knowledge.  
Taking then the common prudence and imprudence of  
mankind in a lump, I suppose none suffer above one-  
fifth to be discovered; therefore, when I hear of any  
person’s misdoing, I think | keep within bounds, if in  
relating it I only make it three times worse than it is ;  
and I reserve to myself the privilege of charging them  
with one fault in four, which for aught I know they  
may be entirely innocent of. You see there are but  
few so careful of doing justice as myself; what reason  
  
  
  
== =  
then have mankind to complain of Scandal ? Ina general  
way the worst that is said of us is only half what: ‘ght  
be said, if all our faults were seen.  
  
But alas! two great evils have lately befallen me at  
the same time; an extreme cold that I can scarce speak,  
and a most terrible toothache that I dare hardly open  
my mouth. For some days past I have received ten  
stories for one I have paid; and I am not able to ba-  
lance my accounts without your assistance. I have  
long thought that if you would make your paper a  
vehicle of scandal, you would double the number of  
your subseribers. I send you herewith accounts of  
four knavish tricks, two * * *, five * * * * *,  
three drubbed wives, and four henpecked husbands, all  
within this fortnight; which you may, as articles of  
news, deliver to the public, and if my toothache con-  
tinues shall send you more, being in the mean time  
your constant reader, ALICE ADDERTONGUE.  
  
I thank my correspondent, Mrs. Addertongue, for her  
good will, but desire to be excused inserting the articles  
of news she has sent me, such things being in reality  
no news at all.
