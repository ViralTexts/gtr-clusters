When I was at Paris about 10 Days since, I was told that a Comet was then visible with a Tail of considerable Length. If it has not been yet observed or heard of here, perhaps this little Notice may be agreable to you. I return’d but last Night, I hope you and yours are well; being very sincerely Your affectionate Friend and Servant

I think it was said to be in some Part of the Bull, and in its Progress towards the Sun. M. Monnier discover’d and observ’d it.

CRAVEN STREET, Aug. 25, 1769.  
  
Dear SiR, When I was at Paris about 10  
Days since, I was told that a Comet was then  
visible with a Tail of considerable Length. If  
it has not been yet observed or heard of here,  
perhaps this little Notice may be agreable to  
you. I return’d but last Night, I hope you  
and yours are well, being very sincerely Your  
affectionate Friend and Servant  
  
(Signed) B. FRANKLIN.  
  
I think it was said to be in some Part of the  
Bull, and in ‘ts Progress towards the Sun.  
M. Monnier discover’d and observ’d it.
