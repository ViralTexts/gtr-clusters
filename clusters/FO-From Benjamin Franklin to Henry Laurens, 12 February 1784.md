. The Disorders of that Government whose Constitution has been so much praised; are come to a height that threatens some violent Convulsion, if not a Dissolution; and its Physicians do not seem even to guess at the Cause of the Disease, and therefore prescribe insufficient Remedies, such as Place Bills, More equal Representation, More frequent Elections, &amp;c &amp;c. In my humble Opinion the Malady consists in the enormous Salaries, Emoluments, &amp; Patronage of great Offices. Ambition, and Avarice, are separately strong Passions. When they are united in pursuit of the same Object, they are too strong to be govern’d by common Prudence, or influenc’d by Publick Spirit &amp; Love of Country; they drive Men irresistably into Factions, Cabals, Dissention &amp; violent Divisions, always mischievous to public Counsels, destructive  
  
to the Peace of Society, and sometimes fatal to its Existence. As long as the immense Profits of those Offices subsist, Members of the shortest and most equally chosen Parliament will have them in View, and contend for them, and their Contentions will have all the same ruinous Consequences.— To me then there seems to be but one effectual Remedy, and that not likely to be adopted by so corrupt a Nation, which is, to abolish all those Profits, and make every Place of Honour a Place of Burthen. By that Means the Effect of one of the Passions above-mentioned would be taken away, and something would be added to counteract the other. Thus the Number of Competitors for great Offices would be diminished, and the Efforts of those who still would obtain them, moderated.

*¢ The disorders of that government whose constitution has been  
so much praised, are come to a height that threatens some violent  
convulsion, if not a dissolution ; and its physicians do not even  
seem to guess at the cause of the disease, and therefore prescribe  
insufficient remedies, such as place bills, more equal representation,  
more frequent elections, &amp;c. &amp;c. In my humble opinion, the ma-  
. lady consists in the enormous salaries, emoluments, and patronage  
  
of great offices. Ambition and avarice are separately strong pas-  
sions: When they are united in pursuit of the same object, they  
are too strong to be governed by common prudence, or influenced  
by public spirit and love of country; they drive men irresistibl  
into factions, cabals, dissentions, and violent divisions, always  
mischievous to public councils, destructive to the peace of society,  
and sometimes fatal to its existence. As long as the immense proe  
fits of these offices subsist, members of the shortest and most  
equally chosen parliaments wil] have them in view, and contend  
for them, and their contentions will have all the same ruinous con-  
sequences. To me there seems to be but one effectual remedy,  
and that not likely to be adopted by so corrupt a nation ; which  
to abolish these profits, and make every place of honor a place of  
burthen. By that means the effect of one of the passions above-  
mentioned would be taken away, and oa would be added  
to counteract the other. Thus the number of competitors for  
great offices would be diminished, and the efforts of those who stil}  
would obtain them moderated.” Vol. IJ. P. 51
