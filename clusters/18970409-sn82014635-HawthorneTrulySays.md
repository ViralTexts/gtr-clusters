 working on his

cattle owner has a splendid credit in  
Kansas City, our principal marketing  
point. Let it be known that the stock­  
man is from Clark county, and his credit  
is unlimited at the bank counter. Ford  
county cattle grower or dealer has yet  
to obtain the financial standing given the  
Clark county cattle owner.

imply from the

have received thousands of applica­  
tions. They come mostly from the  
better class of working people, skilled  
laborers, people who have a little  
money laid up, perhaps, people who  
have had good positions and good  
salaries in the past, but have been  
stranded by the financial depression  
of the last few years. As these peo­  
ple leave the cities, there will be that

Hawthobxe Truly Says : &quot;These  
railroads are positively the greatest  
blessings that the ages have wrought out  
for us. They give us wings; they anni  
hilate the toil and dust -of pilgrimage;  
they spiritualize travel! Transition be­  
ing so tacile, what can be any man&#x27;s in­  
ducement to tarry in one spot? Why  
should he make himself a prisoner for  
life in brick, and stone, and old, worm­  
eaten timber, when he may just as easily  
dwell wherever the beautiful shall offer  
him a home?&quot;  
The magnificent trains of the Santa  
Fe Route offers a facile transition to  
many beautiful spots in Colorado, New  
Mexico, Arizona, and California. Free
