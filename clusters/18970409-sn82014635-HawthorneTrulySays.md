town in which there were just four log  
cabins in 1694 and which now has 10.000  
population and as many more tran­  
sients. I was there in March, when  
the snow was from two to twenty feet  
deep and the mercury from 10 to 20  
degrees below zero the coldest part of  
the winter and there were 300 build­  
ings going up. with steam pipes pass­  
ing through the mortar beds to keep  
them from freezing, and the buildings  
temporarily enclosed in order to Insure  
safe construction. As fast as a room  
was finished it was occupied, and with  
45 licensed taverns, many of them with  
from 40 to 60 rooms and one having  
100 rooms, it was almost impossible to  
secure a lodging place. The daily ar­

pecting was impossible.&quot;

imply from the  
newspaper articles on the subject, we  
have received thousands of applica­  
tions. They come mostly from the  
better class of working people, skilled  
laborers, people who have a little  
money laid up, perhaps, people who  
have had good positions and good  
salaries in the past, but have been  
stranded by the financial depression  
of the last few years. As these peo­  
ple leave the cities, there will be that  
many more places and opportunities  
for those left behind. To relieve the  
crush of population in the cities, and  
get men out of the labor market onto  
the ground, that is our ambition.&quot;
