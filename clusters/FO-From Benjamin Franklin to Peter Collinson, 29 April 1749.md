. The Magical Picture is made thus. Having a large Mezzotinto with a Frame and Glass (Suppose of the King, God preserve him) Take out the Print, and cut a Pannel out of it, near two Inches all round distant from the Frame; if the Cut is thro’ the Picture, tis not the Worse. With thin Paste or Gum Water, fix the Border, that is cut off, on the inside of the Glass, pressing it smoothe and close; then fill up the Vacancy by Gilding the Glass well with Leaf Gold or Brass; gild likewise the inner Edge of the Back of the Frame all round except the Top Part, and form a Communication between that Gilding and the Gilding behind the Glass: then put in the Board, and that side is finished. Turn up the Glass, and gild the foreside exactly over the Back Gilding; and when this is dry, cover it by pasting on the Pannel of the Picture that had been cut out, observing to bring the corresponding Parts of the Border and Picture together; by which the Picture will appear of a Piece as at first, only Part is behind the Glass and Part before. Hold the Picture horizontally by the Top, and place a little moveable gilt Crown on the Kings Head. If now the Picture be moderately electrified, and another Person take hold of the Frame with one Hand, so that his Fingers touch it’s inside Gilding, and with the other Hand endeavour to take off the Crown, he will receive a terrible Blow and fail in the Attempt. If the Picture were highly charg’d, the Consequence might perhaps be as fatal as that of High Treason: For when the Spark is taken thro’ a Quire of Paper laid on the Picture, by Means of a Wire Communication, it makes a fair Hole thro’ every Sheet; that is thro’ 48 Leaves (tho’ a Quire of Paper is thought good Armour against the Push of a Sword, or even against a Pistol Bullet) and the Crack is exceeding loud. The Operator, who, to prevent its falling, holds the Picture by the upper End, where the inside of the Frame is not gilt, feels Nothing of the Shock, and may touch the Crown without Danger, which he pretends is a Test of his Loyalty. If a Ring of Persons take a Shock among them the Experiment is called the Conspiracy.

. A small upright Shaft of Wood passes at right Angles thro’ a thin round Board of about a Foot Diameter, and turns on a sharp Point of Iron, fixt in the lower End, while a strong Wire in the upper End, passing thro’ a small Hole in a thin Brass Plate, keeps the Shaft truly vertical. About 30 Radii of equal Length made of Sash Glass, cut in narrow Strips, issue Horizontally from the Circumference of the Board; the Ends most distant from the Center being about 4 Inches apart. On the End of every one, a Brass Thimble is fixt. If now the Wire of a Bottle, electrified in the Common Way, be brought near the Circumference of this Wheel, it will attract the nearest Thimble, and so put the Wheel in Motion: That Thimble, in passing by, receives a Spark, and thereby being electrified is repell’d and so driven forwards, while a second, being attracted, approaches the Wire, receives a Spark and is driven after the first; and so on till the Wheel has gone once round, when the Thimbles, before Electrified, approaching the Wire, instead of being attracted, as they were at first, are repell’d; and the Motion presently ceases. But if another Bottle, which had been charg’d thro’ the Coating be placed near the same Wheel, it’s Wire will attract the Thimbles repell’d by the first, and thereby doubles the Force that carries the Wheel round; and not only, taking out the Fire that had been communicated to the Thimbles by the first Bottle, but even robbing them of their natural Quantity, instead of being repell’d when they come again towards the first Bottle, they are more strongly attracted: so that the Wheel mends its Pace till it goes with great Rapidity, 12 or 15 Rounds in a Minute; and with such Strength, as that the Weight of 100 Spanish Dollars, with which we once loaded it, did not

26. ’Tis amazing to observe in how small a Portion of Glass a great Electrical Force may lie. A thin Glass Bubble about an Inch Diameter, weighing only six Grains, being half filled with Water, partly gilt on the outside, and furnished with a Wire Hook, gives when electrified, as great a Shock as a Man is willing to bear. As the Glass is thickest near the Orifice, I suppose the lower half, which being gilt, was electrified, and gave the Shock, did not exceed two Grains; for it appeared, when broke, much thinner than the upper half. If one of these thin Bottles be electrified by the Coating, and the Spark taken out thro the Gilding, it will break the Glass inwards, at the same Time that it breaks the Gilding outwards.  
27. And allowing, for the Reasons before given §§8, 9, 10, that there is no more Electrical Fire in a Bottle after Charging than before, how great must the Quantity be in this small Portion of Glass! It seems as if it were of its very Substance and Essence. Perhaps if that due Quantity of Electrical Fire, so obstinately retain’d by Glass, could be separated from it, it would no longer be Glass, it might loose it’s Transparency, or its Fragility, or Elasticity. Experiments may possibly be invented hereafter to discover this

Then apply the giving Wire, and give to the Shot the Spark it wanted, so will the Cork return: Give it another, which will be an Addition to it’s natural Quantity, so will the Cork be repell’d again; And so may the Experiment be repeated, as long as there is any Charge remaining in the Bottles; Which shews that Bodies, having less than the common Quantity of Electricity, repel each other, as well as those that have more.  
Chagrin’d a little that We have hitherto been able to discover Nothing in this Way of Use to Mankind, and the hot Weather coming on, when Electrical Experiments are not so agreable; ’tis proposed to put an End to them for this Season somewhat humorously in a Party of Pleasure on the Banks of SchuylKill, (where Spirits are at the same Time to be fired by a Spark sent from Side to Side thro’ the River).

FRANKLIN, writing to his friend Peter Collison,  
F.RS., in 1748, says, “It is amazing to see in how  
small a portion of glass a great electrical force may  
lie. A thin glass bubble, about an inch in diameter,  
weighing only six grains, being half filled with  
water, partly gilt on the outside, and furnished with  
a wire hook, gives, when electrified, as great a shock  
as a man well can bear.”

about two inches from the frame all  
round. Then, ?with tViin paste, fix the  
border that is left on the inside of the  
glass, pressing it smooth andjclose.  
Fill up the vacancy by covering the  
glass well with leaf gold or thin tin-  
foil, so that it may lie close. Cover  
likewise the inner edge of the bottom  
part of the back of the frame with the  
same tinfoil, and make a communication  
between that and the tin?r„;i {n fho  
otiMATp nf fhe triads. Then Tint in the  
hoard, and that side it finished. Next  
turn up the glass, and cover the fore  
side with tin-foil exactly over that on  
the back part, and when it is dry paste  
over it the panel of the print that ?was  
cut out. Observe to bring the  
corresponding parts of border and panel  
tegether, so that the picture will  
appear as at first, only part of it  
behind the glass, and part before.  
Lastly, hold the print horizontally by  
the top, and place a little movable gilt  
crown on the portrait — suppose that of  
Queen &#x27;Victoria. Now, if the tin foil on  
both sides of the glass be moderately  
electrified, and another person takeg  
hold of the bottom of the frame with one  
hand, so that his fingers touch the tin-  
foil, and with tbe other hand attempts  
to take off the crown, he will receive a  
very smart blow, and fail in the  
attempt. The operator, who holds the  
frame by the upper end where there is no  
tin-foil, feels nothing of the sheet,  
and can touch the face of the Queen  
without danger, which he pretends is a  
test of his loyalty

weighing only six grains, being half filled with water, partly gilt  
on the outside and furnished with a wire hook, gives, when electri-  
fied, as great a shock as a man can well bear. As the glass is thick-  
est near the orifice, I suppose the lower half—which, being gilt,  
was electrified and gave the shock—did not exceed two grains; for  
it appeared, when broke, much thinner than the upper half.’’. . .  
‘* Allowing that there is no more electrical fire in a bottle after  
charging than before, how great must be the quantity in this small  
portion of glass! It seems as if it were of its very substance and  
essence. Perhaps if that due quantity of electrical fire, so obsti-  
nately retained by glass, could be separated from it, it would no  
longer be glass; it might lose its transparency, or its brittleness, or  
its elasticity. Experiments may possibly be invented hereafter to  
discover this.’

terrible blow, and fail in the attempt. If the  
picture were highly charged, the consequence  
might perhaps be as fatal as that of high treason;  
for, when the spark is taken through a quire of  
paper laid on the picture by means of a wire com-  
munication, it makes a fair hole through every  
sheet, that is, through forty-eight leaves, though  
a quire of paper is thought good armour against  
the push of a sword, or even against a pistol  
bullet, and the crack is exceeding loud. The  
operator, who holds the picture by the upper end,  
where the inside of the frame is not gilt, to pre-  
vent its falling, feels nothing of the shock, and
