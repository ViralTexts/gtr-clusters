Sir,  
Passy Oct. 9. 1780.  
I received and read with Pleasure your Thoughts on American Finance, and your Scheme of a Bank. I communicated them to the Abbé Morellet, who is a good Judge of the Subject, and he has translated them into French. He thinks them generally very just, and very clearly exprest. I shall forward them to a Friend in the Congress. That Body is, as you well suppose not well skilled in Financing. But their Deficiency in Knowledge has been amply supply’d by Good Luck. They issued an immence Quantity of Paper Bills, to pay, clothe, arm &amp; feed their Troops, &amp; fit out Ships, and with this Paper, without Taxes for the first three Years, they fought &amp; baffled one of the most powerful Nations of Europe. They hoped notwithstanding its Quantity to have kept up the Value of their Paper. In this they were mistaken. It depreciated gradually. But this Depreciation, tho’ in some Circumstances inconvenient, has had the general good and great Effect, of operating as a Tax, and perhaps the most equal of all Taxes, since it depreciated in the Hands of the Holders of the Money, and thereby taxed them in proportion to the Sums they hold and the Time they held it, which is generally in proportion to Mens Wealth. Thus after h

. Thus so much of the Publick Debt has been in this Manner insensibly paid that the Remainder, which you desire to know, does not exceed six Millions sterling. And now they are working with new Paper exprest to be equal in Value to silver, which they have made to bear Interest, and have provided such Funds to pay that Interest, that probably its original Value will be supported. In the meantime the Vigour of their Military Operations is again revived; and they are now as able, with respect to Money, to carry on the War, as they were at the Beginning, and much more so with regard to Troops Arms &amp; Discipline. It is also an encreasing Nation, Sixty thousand Children having been born annually in the United States since the Beginning of the War;

taken. It depreciated gradually. But this de-  
preciation, though in some circumstances in-  
  
convenient, has had the general good and great |  
effect of operating as a tax, and perhaps the |  
  
most equal of all taxes, since it depreciated in  
the hands of the holders of money, and thereby  
taxed them in proportion to the sums they held,  
and the time they held it, which generally is in  
proportion to men’s wealth Thus, so much  
of the public debt has been, in this manner, in-  
sensibly paid that the remainder does not ex-  
ceed six millions sterling In the mean time  
the vigor of their military operations is again re-  
vived, and they are now as able, with respect to  
money, to carry on the war as they were at the  
beginning, and much more so with regard to  
troops, arms, and discipline. It is also an in-  
creasing nation, sixty thousand children having  
been born annually in the United States since  
the beginning of the war.”
