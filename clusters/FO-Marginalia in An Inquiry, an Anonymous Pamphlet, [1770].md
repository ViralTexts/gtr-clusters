a that all the King’s Dominions make one State, which they do not nor ever did since the Conquest. Our Kings have ever had Dominions not subject to the English Parliament; as first the Province of France, of which Jersey and Guernsey remain, always governed by their own Laws; appealing to the King in Council only, and not to our Courts or to the House of Lords. Scotland was in the same Situation before the Union: It had the same King, but a separate Parliament; and the Parliament of England had no Jurisdiction over it. Ireland the same in truth, tho’ the British Parliament has usurp’d a Dominion over it. The Colonies were originally settled on the Idea of such extrinsic Dominions of the King, and of the King only. Hanover is now such a Dominion.

Here appears the Excellency of the Invention of Colony Government, by separate independent Legislatures. By this means the remotest Parts of a great Empire, may be as well governed as the Center; Misrule, Oppresions of Proconsuls, and Discontents and Rebellions thence arising prevented. By this Means the Power of a King may be extended without Inconvenience Over Territories of any Dimensions how great soever. America was thus happily governed in all its different and remote Settlements, by the Crown and their own Assemblies till the new Politicks took place, of governing it by our Parliament, which have not succeeded and never will.

e British Parliament’s Attempting to deprive them of it.  
The next question is whether, if the nature of the constitution precludes giving the Americans their full privileges as Englishmen, “they should not be allowed such a form of government, as will best secure them their just rights and natural liberties?”  
  
Right.  
Certainly  
Very just. Only that the arbitrary Government of a single Person is more eligible than the arbitrary Government of a Body of Men. A single Man may be afraid or asham’d of doing Injustice. A Body is never either one or the other, if it is strong enough. It cannot apprehend Assassination; and by dividing the Shame among them, it is so little apiece, that no one minds it.

The question at issue is how they should contribute. Four ways are possible. One is by requisition from the King in council “of a certain sum by them fixed, to be raised in each province, in such manner as their own assemblies shall think fit.” The second is a similar requisition from Parliament and raised in the same way. The third is taxation by Parliament as it is now constituted. T

The second method, a requisition by Parliament, is preferable because “in so large a body of men, both justice and the true interest of the empire are more likely to be duly regarded”; Americans may therefore “reasonably expect the burden will be more equitably laid upon them.” Proceedings in Parliament are less rapid than in the Privy Council, so that if need be the Americans “will have more time to petition or

The Privilege of Petitioning has been attempted to be wrested from them. The Assemblies uniting to petition has been called a flagitious Attempt in the Minister’s Letters, and such Assemblies as would persist in it, have therefore been dissolved!  
For this privilege, the least which a subject can enjoy, is not to be denied them, however an ultimate compliance may be insisted on as indispensable.” The Americans’ financial position, furthermore, will probably be better understood in Parliament than in the ministry and “their

‘ The fecond method I took novice of, was by a like requifition made  
by the Britith parliament. and to be raifed and colle&amp;ted in fuch mahner  
asthe provincial affemblics fhall like beft. This method, however ina-  
dequate upon the whole, appears to me much preferable to the former,  
asin fo large a body of men, both juftice and the true intereft of the em-  
pire are more likely to be duly regarded; and therefore they may rez  
fonably expect the barden will be more equitably Jaid upon them. Bee  
fides, it is not improbable but fome who have property among them may  
fit in this aflembly. And it may ferther be obferved, that their proceec-  
ings are not quite fo rapid and precipitate as thofe of the pris y-counci!,  
fo that fhould it be found unneceffary, they will have more time to peti-  
tion or make remonftrances, For this privilege, the leaft which a fub-  
jet can enjoy, is not to be denied them, however an ultimate compli-  
ance may be infiled on as indifpenfable. And it is likewife, let me
