as my temporal happiness are very obliging, and I can only  
thank you for them, and offer you mine ia return. I have  
myself no doubt that I shall enjoy as much of both as is  
proper for me. That Being who gave me existence, and

And, if he loves me, can I doubt that he will go on to take  
care of me, not only here and hereafter? This to some may  
appear presumption; to me it appears the best grounded  
hope; hope of the future built on experience of the past.’
