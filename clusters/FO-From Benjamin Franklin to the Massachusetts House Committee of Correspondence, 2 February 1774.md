Gentlemen,  
London, Feb. 2. 1774  
I received the Honour of your Letter dated Decr. 21. containing a distinct Account of the Proceedings at Boston relative to the Tea imported there, and of the Circumstances that occasioned its Destruction. I communicated the same to Lord Dartmouth, with some other Advices of the same Import. It is yet unknown what Measures will be taken here on the Occasion; but the Clamour against the Proceeding is high and general. I am truly concern’d, as I believe all considerate Men are with you, that there should seem to any a Necessity for carrying Matters to such Extremity, as, in a Dispute about Publick Rights, to destroy private Property; This (notwithstanding the Blame justly due to those who obstructed the Return of the Tea) it is impossible to justify with People so prejudiced in favour of the Power of Parliament to tax America, as most are in this Country. As the India Company however are not our Adversaries, and the offensive Measure of sending their Teas did not take its Rise with them, but was an Expedient of the Ministry to serve them and yet avoid a Repeal of the old Act, I cannot but wish and hope that before any compulsive Measures are thought of here, our General Court will have shewn a Disposition to repair the Damage and make Compensation to the Company. This all our Friends here wish with me; and that if War is finally to be made upon us, which some threaten, an Act of violent Injustice on our part, unrectified, may not give a colourable Pretence for it. A speedy Reparation will immediately set us right in the Opinion of all Europe. And tho’ the Mischief was the Act of Persons unknown, yet as probably they cannot be found or brought to answer for it, there seems to be some reasonable Claim on the Society at large in which it happened. Making voluntarily such Reparation can be no Dishonour to us or Prejudice to our Claim of Rights, since Parliament here has frequently considered in the same Light similar Cases; and only a few Years since, when a valuable Sawmill, which had been erected at a great Expence was violently destroyed by a Number of Persons supposed to be Sawyers, but unknown, a Grant was made out of the Publick Treasury of Two Thousand Pounds to the Owner as a Compensation. I hope in thus freely (and perhaps too forwardly) expressing my Sentiments and Wishes, I shall not give Offence to any. I am sure I mean well; being ever with sincere Affection to my native Country, and great Respect to the Assembly and yourselves, Gentlemen, Your most obedient and most humble Servant

l/imlun. February 2. 1774.  
(e-ntlemen: 1 received the u,,nor of  
your Letter dated i &gt;&gt; r, H containing a  
distinct Account of tho 3&#x27;roceedings at  
r*?wton relative to the Tea Imported  
there, and of the Circumstance? i|,at oc?  
casioned its Destruction. I communl­  
Cated the s?melo I_ord Dartmouth, vvrth  
BOme other Advices of th?- same Im;?ort.  
It Is yet unknown what M-asur-s will ho  
taken here on the Occaalon; but the Cla?  
mour against the Proceeding Is high and  
general. I am truly concern&#x27;d, as I be?  
lieve nil consid?r?t.? Men are with yoa,  
that there should seem to anv a Necessity  
for carrying Matters to such Extremity,  
ns. In a Dispute at-out J&#x27;ubllek Rights, to  
destroy private Property; This (notwith?  
standing the Blame justly due to ?hose  
who obstructed the Return of the Tea)  
It is Impossibly to Justify with People so  
prejudiced in favour of the Row. r ?&gt;t  
Parliament to tax America, as most are  
In this Country.  
As th? India Company, however, are rot  
our Adversaries, and the offensive Mea?  
sure of scriuiing their Teas did not tako  
its Rise with them, but was an Expedient  
of the Ministry to servo them and yet  
avoid a repeal of the old Act, I cannot  
but wish &amp; hope thai before any compul?  
sive Measurea are thought of here, our  
General Court will have shewn a Dispo?  
sition to repair th?? Damage and make  
Compensation to the Company. This all  
our Friends here wish with me; and that  
if War is finally to be made, upon us,  
which some threaten, an Act of violent  
Injustice on our part, unrectlfled, may  
not give a colourable Pretence for it.  
A sp?-e?ly Reparation will immediately  
set us right In the Opinion of all Europ-?.  
Ami tho&#x27; the Mlschl? f was the Act or  
Persons unknown, yet as probably they  
cannot be found or brought to unswer for  
it. there seems to be some reasonable  
Claim on tho Society at large In which it  
happened. Making voluntarily such R? Da?  
tation can be no Dishonor to us or Pre?  
judice to our Claim of Rights, since 3*ar­  
llament here- has frequently consider.d in  
the same Eight similar Cases; an?) only  
a few Years since, when a valuable Saw?  
mill, which had been erected at a great  
Expence, was violently destroyed by a  
Number of persons, suppose?! to be Saw?  
yers, but unknown, a Grant was made  
out of the Publlck Treasury of Two  
Thousand Pounds to the Owner as a Com?  
pensation.  
I hop?? In thus frepiy (and perhaps too  
forwardly) expressing my Sentiments &amp;  
Wishes. I shall not give Offence? to any.  
I am sure I mean weli; being ever with  
sincere Affection to my native Country,  
and great Respect to the Assembly and  
yourselves.  
Gentlemen,  
Your most obedient  
and most humble Servent,

LONDON, Feb. 2, 1774.  
GerNTLEMENc-1 received the Honour of your  
Letter dated Decr. 21, contalining a distinct  
Account of ltie Proceedings at Boston relative  
to the Tea imlported there, and of the Circum­  
stances that occasioned its Destruction. I com­  
municatod the same to Lord Dartmouth, with  
some other Advices of the sane import. It is  
yet unklnowin what leasures will be taken  
here on the Occasion; but the Clahnour against  
the Proceeding is high andi general. I aml truly  
concern&#x27;d, as I believe all considerate Men are  
with you, that there should seem to any a Ne­  
cessity for carrying Matters to such Extremity,  
as, in a Dispute about Publtek Rights, to do­  
stroy private Property; This ( notwithstanding  
the Blanme justly due to those who obstructed  
the Return of the Tea) it is impossible to justi.  
fy with People so prejudiced in favour of the  
Power of Parliament to tax America, as most  
are in this Country.--As the India Company  
however are not our Adversaries, and the of­  
fensive Measure of sending their Teas did not  
take its Rise with them, but was an Expedient  
of the Ministry to serve them and yet avoid a  
Repeal of the old Act, I cannot but wish &amp;  
hope that before any compulsive Measures are  
thought of here, our General Court will have  
shewn a Disposition to repair theDamage and  
make Compensation to the Company. This all  
our Friends here wish with me; and that if  
War is finally to be made upon us, which some  
threaten, an Act of violent Injustice on our  
part, unrectified, may not give a colourable  
Pretence for it. A speedy Reparation will im­  
mediately set us right in the Opinion of all  
Europe. And the&#x27; the Mischief was the Act of  
Persons unknown, yet as probably they cannot  
be found or brought to answer for it, there  
seems to be some reasonable Claim on the So­  
ciety at large in which it happened. Making  
voluntarily such Reparation can be no Dis­  
honour to us or Prejudice to our Claim of  
Rights, since Parliament here has frequently  
considered in the same Light similar Cases;  
and only a few Years since, when a valuable  
Saw-mill, which had been erected at:a great  
Expense was violently destroyed by.a Number  
of Persons supposed to be Sawyers, hut un­  
known, a Grant was made out of tihe Publich  
Treasury of Two Thousand Pounds to the  
Owner as a Compensation.--I hope in thus  
freely (and perhaps too forwardly) expressihg  
my Sentiments &amp; Wishes, I shall not give  
Offence to any. I am sure I mean well; being  
ever with sincere Affection to my native Coun­  
try, and great Respect to the Assemlbly and  
yourselves, Gentlemnen,  
Your most obedient and most humble Serv.  
ant B FRANKLIN.
