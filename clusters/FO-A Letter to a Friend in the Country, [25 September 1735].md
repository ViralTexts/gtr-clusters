th, &amp;c. yet it is plain that if they have a Right to make Use of the lowest Degrees of Persecution, or to lay a Man under any Restraints for religious Speculations; they have a Right to proceed to higher degrees, if the lowest don’t answer the End, and so to go on to the highest that even a Spanish Inquisition cou’d invent, if nothing less will do. O rare Protestants! It is well observ’d by an ingenious Gentleman, that whoever would convince by Stripes and Terror, proclaims open War against Christianity and Common Sense, against the Peace of Society and the Happiness of Mankind. Persecution, says he, for any Opinion whatsoever, justifies Persecution for any Opinion in the World; and every Persecutor is liable to be persecuted, upon his own Principles, by every Man upon Earth of a different Opinion and more Strength. What dismal Butcheries would such a cruel Spirit raise!

have since learned more wit than to sacrifice the peace of our govern-  
ment, or any man’s peace, to the passion or maggots of the clergy. We  
protect them all against one another, and all men against them. As to  
their own subtle disputes and inventions, we meddle not with them, if  
they meddle not with us. They have good pay, anda clear stage; and  
it is not for their credit if they desire more. If any man be a bad sub-  
ject, and break our laws, we know how to deal with him, without the  
assistance of the clergy: and if any man be a bad believer, it is their  
business to convince him. But whoever would convince by stripes and  
terror, proclaims open war against common sense, against the peace of  
society, and the happiness of mankind. Persecution, for any opinion  
whatsoever, justifies persecution for every opinion in the world; and  
every persecutor is liable to be persecuted, upon his own principles, by  
every man upon earth of a different opinion, and more strength. What  
dismal butcheries would such a cruel spirit raise !
