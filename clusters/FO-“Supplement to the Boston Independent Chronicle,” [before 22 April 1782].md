 “contemptuous insolence” proved that it was “the Production of some such audacious Rebel.” The Public Advertiser did not print the first item, the letter from “Capt. Gerrish” quoting one from “James Craufurd.” The publisher may have felt, as James Hutton did, that the news it reported was so exaggerated as to be inconceivable, even by the barbaric standards of this war. Most of the piece, however, ending with Craufurd’s signature, appeared in The Remembrancer; or Impartial Repository of Public Events for 1782, part II, pp. 135–6, where it was attributed to the Boston Chronicle.  
  
[before April 22, 1782]  
Numb. 705.SUPPLEMENT  
TO THE BOSTONINDEPENDENT CHRONICLE.  
BOSTON, March 12.  
Extract of a Letter from Capt. Gerrish, of the New-England Militia, dated Albany, March 7.  
The Peltry taken in the Expedition [See the Account of the Expedition to Oswegatchie on the River St. Laurence, in our Paper of the 1st Instant.] will as you see amount to a good deal of Money. The Possession of this Booty at first gave us Pleasure; but we were struck with Horror to find among the Packages, 8 large ones containing SCALPS of our unhappy Country-folks, taken in the three last Years by the Senneka Indians from the Inhabitants of the Frontiers of New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and sent by them as a Present to Col. Haldimand, Governor of Canada, in order to be by him transmitted to England. They were accompanied by the following curious Letter to that Gentleman.  
  
May it please your Excellency,  
Teoga, Jan. 3d, 1782.  
“At the Request of the Senneka Chiefs I send herewith to your Excellency, under the Care of James Boyd, eight Packs of Scalps, cured, dried, hooped and painted, with all the Indian triumphal Marks, of which the following is Invoice and Explanation.  
  
No. 1.  
Containing 43 Scalps of Congress Soldiers killed in different Skirmishes; these are stretched on black Hoops, 4 Inches diameter; the inside of the Skin painted red, with a small black Spot to note their being killed with Bullets. Also 62 of Farmers, killed in their Houses; the Hoops red; the Skin painted brown, and marked with a Hoe; a black Circle all round, to denote their being surprised in the Night; and a black Hatchet in the Middle, signifying their being killed with that Weapon.  
  
No. 2.  
Containing 98 of Farmers killed in their Houses; Hoops red; Figure of a Hoe, to mark their Profession; great white Circle and Sun, to shew they were surprised in the Day-time; a little red Foot, to shew they stood upon their Defence, and died fighting for their Lives and Families.  
  
No. 3.  
Containing 97 of Farmers; Hoops green, to shew they were killed in their Fields; a large white Circle with a little round Mark on it for the Sun, to shew that it was in the Day-time; black Bullet-mark on some, Hatchet on others.  
  
No. 4.  
Containing 102 of Farmers, mixed of the several Marks above; only 18 marked with a little yellow Flame, to denote their being of Prisoners burnt alive, after being scalped, their Nails pulled out by the Roots and other Torments: one of these latter supposed to be of a rebel Clergyman, his Band being fixed to the Hoop of his Scalp. Most of the Farmers appear by the Hair to have been young or middle-aged Men; there being but 67 very grey Heads among them all; which makes the Service more essential.  
  
No. 5.  
Containing 88 Scalps of Women; Hair long, braided in the Indian Fashion, to shew they were Mothers; Hoops blue; Skin yellow Ground, with little red Tadpoles to represent, by way of Triumph, the Tears or Grief occasioned to their Relations; a black scalping Knife or Hatchet at the Bottom to mark their being killed with those Instruments. 17 others, Hair very grey; black Hoops; plain brown Colour; no Mark but the short Club or Cassetete, to shew they were knocked down dead, or had their Brains beat out.  
  
No. 6.  
Containing 193 Boys’ Scalps, of various Ages; small green Hoops; whitish Ground on the Skin, with red Tears in the Middle, and black Bullet-marks, Knife, Hatchet, or Club, as their Deaths happened.  
  
No. 7.  
211 Girls’ Scalps, big and little; small yellow Hoops; white Ground; Tears; Hatchet, Club, scalping Knife, &amp;c.  
  
No. 8.  
This Package is a Mixture of all the Varieties above-mention’d, to the Number of 122; with a Box of Birch Bark, containing 29 little Infants’ Scalps of various Sizes; small white Hoops; white Ground; no Tears; and only a little black Knife in the Middle, to shew they were ript out of their Mothers’ Bellies.  
  
With these Packs, the Chiefs send to your Excellency the following Speech, delivered by Conejogatchie in Council, interpreted by the elder Moore, the Trader, and taken down by me in Writing.  
  
Father,  
We send you herewith many Scalps, that you may see we are not idle Friends.  
A blue Belt.  
  
Father,  
We wish you to send these Scalps over the Water to the great King, that he may regard them and be refreshed; and that he may see our faithfulness in destroying his Enemies, and be convinced that his Presents have not been made to ungrateful People.  
A blue and white Belt with red Tassels.  
Father,  
Attend to what I am now going to say: it is a Matter of much Weight. The great King’s Enemies are many, and they grow fast in Number. They were formerly like young Panthers: they could neither bite nor scratch: we could play with them safely: we feared nothing they could do to us. But now their Bodies are become big as the Elk, and strong as the Buffalo: they have also got great and sharp Claws. They have driven us out of our Country for taking Part in your Quarrel. We expect the great King will give us another Country, that our Children may live after us, and be his Friends and Children, as we are. Say this for us to the great King. To enforce it we give this Belt.  
A great white Belt with blue Tassels.  
Father,  
We have only to say farther that your Traders exact more than ever for their Goods: and our Hunting is lessened by the War, so that we have fewer Skins to give for them. This ruins us. Think of some Remedy. We are poor: and you have Plenty of every Thing. We know you will send us Powder and Guns, and Knives and Hatchets: but we also want Shirts and Blankets.  
A little white Belt.  
I do not doubt but that your Excellency will think it proper to give some farther Encouragement to those honest People. The high Prices they complain of, are the necessary Effect of the War. Whatever Presents may be sent for them through my Hands, shall be distributed with Prudence and Fidelity. I have the Honour of being  
Your Excellency’s most obedient And most humble Servant,  
JAMES CRAUFURD.”

It is now proposed to make them up in decent little Packets, seal and direct them; one to the King, containing a Sample of every Sort for his Museum; one to the Queen, with some of Women and little Children: the Rest to be distributed among both Houses of Parliament; a double Quantity to the Bishops.

eral, in which you are pleased to qualify me with the title of pirate.  
A pirate is defined to be hostis humani generis, [an enemy to all mankind]. It happens, Sir, that I am an enemy to no part of mankind, except your nation, the English; which nation at the same time comes much more within the definition; being actually an enemy to, and at war with, one whole quarter of the world, America, considerable parts of Asia and Africa, a great part of Europe, and in a fair way of being at war with the rest.  
A pirate makes war for the sake of rapine. This is not the kind of war I am engaged in against England. Our’s is a war in defence of liberty. … the most just of all wars; and of our properties, which your nation would have taken from us, without our consent, in violation of our rights, and by an armed force. Your’s, therefore, is a war of rapine; of course, a piratical war: and those who approve of it, and are engaged in it, more justly deserve the name of pirates, which you bestow on me. It is, indeed, a wa

that he may regaidlhem and be re-’

Tents have not been made to un  
grateful people.  
  
A blue and white belt  
with red talTcls.  
  
Father ;  
  
Attend to what I am notv going  
to fay; it is&#x27; a matter of much  
  
Weight The great king’s enemies  
  
are many, and they grow faff: in  
number. They were formerly like  
young panthers ; they could neither  
bite nor fcratch; we cflbld play  
with them fafely ; we feared noth-  
ing tliey could do us. But now  
their bodies are become big as the  
elk, and ftrong a» the buffaloe ;  
they have alfo got great and fliarp  
claws. They have driven us out  
&#x27;,of their country, for taking part in  
your quarrel. IVe eipeft the great  
king will give us another country,  
tliat our children may live after us,  
and be his friends and children as  
we are. Say this for ns to the  
great king. To enforce it, w&#x27;e give  
this belt.  
  
A great white belt with  
, blue taflTels.  
Father; •  
  
We have only to fay further, ^st  
your traders exaiT more than.ever  
lor their goods ; and our hunting is  
lefl&#x27;ened by the war, fo&#x27;that we have  
fewer (kins to give for them., ,&#x27;1&#x27;his  
roins us. Think of fome remedy.  
We arc poor, and you have pl&#x27;kty  
of every thing. — We know yoii^ljl  
fend us powder and guns, and kii\ts  
and hatchets ; but we alfo want  
(hirts and blankets. ’  
  
A little white belt.  
  
I do not doubt but your Ertcellen-  
cy will think it proper to give fome  
further encouragement to ihofe ho-  
neft people. &#x27;I&#x27;he high prices they  
complain of, are the neceffary e(Te6t  
of the war. . Whatever, prefeiits  
may be fent for them througji my  
hands, (hall be diftributed with pru-  
dence and ffdelity. I have the ho-  
nour of being your Excellency’s

rather,  
We wish you to send these scalps over the  
w«*er to the gieat King, that he may regard them,

Father, *  
Attend to what I am now going to say ; it is a  
matter of much weight. The great King’s enemies  
•re many, and they grow fast in number. They  
were formerly like young panthers ; they could nei­  
ther bite nor scratch; we could plav with them  
safely; we feared nothing they eaulil do to us. But  
now their bodies are become big as the Flk, strong  
as the Buffalo; they have also got great and sharp  
claws. They have driven us out of our countrv for  
taking part in your quarrel. We expeet the great  
King will give u* another countrv, that our children  
may live after us, and be his friends ami children as  
we are. Suy this for us to our great King. To en­  
force it, give this belt.

\Vt» liave only to say further, that your tra­  
ders exact more than ever fur their goods; and our  
limiting is lessened bv the w»r, so that ire Lave few­  
er skins to give far them. This rnius us. Think of  
some remedy. We are poor ; and you have plenty  
ot every thing. &quot;We know you will send us powder  
and Runs and knives and hatchets: but we also want  
shirts and blankets.  
Jl Little IThite Belt.  
“ 1 do not doubt but that your Kxcellency will  
think it proper to give some further encouragement  
to those honest people. 1 he high prices ^they  
complain of are the necessary ell&#x27;ect of the” war.  
Whatever presents may be sent for them through  
my hands, shall be distributed with prudence and  
fidelity. I hare the honor of beibR your excellency’s  
most obedient and most humble servant,

No. 1. containing 43 scalps of Congress soldiers,  
  
killed in different skirmishes: these are stretched on  
  
black hoops, 4 inch diameter—the inside of the skin  
painted red with a small black spot, to note their  
being killed with bullets. Also 62 of farmers,killed  
in their houses; the hoops painted red—the skin

from Capt. Genish, of the American army, dated at Albany, March 7th, 1782,  
as follows :  
  
“The peltry taken in the expedition, will, you see, amount to a good deal  
of money. The possession of this booty at first gave us pleasure ; but we  
were struck with horror to find among the packages, eight large ones con-  
taining scalps of our unfortunate country folks, taken in the three last years  
by the Seneca Indians, from’ the inhabitants of the frontiers of New-York,  
New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and sent by them as a present to  
Col. Haldimand, Governor of Canada, in order to be by him transmitted to  
England. ‘They were accompanied by the following curious letter to that  
gentleman.  
  
“* Tioga, January 3d, 1782.  
  
“¢ May it please your Excellency.—At the request of the Seneca chiefs, [  
herewith send to your Excellency, under the care of James Boyd, eight  
packages of scalps, cured, dried, hooped, and painted with all the Indian tri-  
umphal marks, of which the following is invoice and explanation: ~—«  
  
No. 1. Containing 43 scalps of Congress soldiers, killed in different skir-  
mishes : these are stretched on black hoops, 4 inch diameter—the inside of  
the skin painted red with a small black spot, to note their being killed with  
bullets. Also 62 of farmers, killed in their houses; the hoops painted red—  
the skin painted brown and marked with a hoe—a black circle all round, to  
note their being surprised in the night—and a black hatchet in the middle,  
signifying their being killed with that weapon.  
  
No. 2. Containing 98 of farmers, killed in their houses: hoops red—figure  
  
5  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Jot  
  
of a hoe, te mark their profession—great white circle and sun, to show they  
were surprised in the day time. A little red foot, to show they stood upon  
their detence, and died fighting for their lives and families.  
  
No. 3. Containing 97 of farmers: hoops green, to show they were killed in  
the fields—a large white circle with a little round mark on it for the sun, to  
show it was in the day time—black bullet mark on some, a hatchet on others,  
  
No. 4. Containing 102 of farmers, mixed of several of the marks above,  
only 18 marked with a little yellow flame, to denote their being of prisoners  
burnt alive, after being scalped, their nails pulled out by the roots, and other  
torments ; one of these latter, supposed to be of an American clergyman, his  
band being fixed to the hoop of his scalp. Most of the farmers appear by the  
hair to have been young or middle-aged men, there being but 67 very gray  
heads among them all ; which makes the service more essential.  
  
No. 5. Containing 88 scalps of women: hair long, braided in the Indian fa-  
shion, to show they were mothers--hoops blue, skin yellow ground with little red  
tadpoles to represent, by way of triumph, the tears or grief occasioned to their  
relations—a black scalping knife or hatchet at the bottom, to mark their be-  
ing killed by those instruments. 17 others, hair very gray, black hoops, plain  
brown colour, no marks but the short club or cassa-tete, to show they were  
knocked down dead, or had their brains beat out.  
  
No. 6. Containing 193 boys’ scalps of various ages: small green hoops,  
whitish ground on the skin, with red tears in the middle, and black marks,  
knife, hatchet, or club, as their death happened.  
  
No. 7. Containing 211 girls’ scalps, big and little: small yellow hoops,  
white ground—tears, hatchet, club, scalping knife, &amp;c.  
  
No. 8. This package is a mixture of all the varieties above mentioned, to  
the number of 122: with a box of birch bark, containing 29 little infants’  
scalps, of various sizes—small white hoops, white ground, no tears, and only  
a little black knife in the middle, to show they were ripped out of their mo-  
thers’ bellies.  
  
With these packs the chiefs send your excellency the following speech, de-  
livered by Conieogatchie in council, interpreted by the elder Moore, the tra-  
der, and taken down by me in writing.  
  
Father—We send you herewith many scalps, that you may see we are not  
idle friends.  
  
A Blue Belt.

fulness in destroying his enemies, and be convinced that his presents have not

They were formerly like young panthers; they could neither bite nor  
scratch ; we could play with them safely ; we feared nothing they could do  
tous. But now their bodies have become as big as the elk, and strong as the  
buffalo ; they have also got great and sharp claws. They have driven us out  
of our country for taking part in your quarrel. We expect tle great king  
will give us another country, that our children may live after us, and be his  
friends and children as we are. Say this for us to our great king. To en-  
force it, give this belt.

packs of sealps, cured and dried, hooped, and  
painted with all the Indian triumphal iarks, of  
which the following is invoice and explanation :  
  
‘Pack 1. Containing forty-three scalps of  
Congress soldiers, killed in different skirmishes ;  
these are stretched on black hoops, four inches in  
diameter ; the inside of the skin is painted red,  
with asmall black spot to denote their being  
killed with bullets. Also, sixty-two of farmers,  
killed in their houses, the skin painted brown  
and marked with a hoe ; a black eirele all round,  
to denote their being surprised in the night, and  
a black hatchet in the middle, signifying their  
being killed with that weapon.  
  
**2. Containing ninety-eight farmers, killed in |  
their houses: hoops red; figure of a hoe to mark  
their profession ; great white circle and sun, to}  
show they were surprised in the day time; a)  
little red foot, to show they stood upon their de-  
fence, and died fighting for their lives and fami-  
ies.  
  
**3. Containing ninety-seven farmers, hoops |  
green, to show that they were killed in their|  
fields ; a large white circle with round mark in}  
it for the sun, to show that it was in the day  
day time ; black ballet mark on some—hatchet  
on others.  
  
‘© 4, Containing one hundred and two of far-  
mers, mixed of the several marks above, only  
jeighteen marked with a little yellow flame, to  
\denote their being of prisoners burnt alive, after  
| being scalped, their nails pulled out by tee roots, |  
jand other torments; one of these latter is sup-|  
posed to be a rebel clergyman, his band being |  
|fixed to the hoop of his scalp. Most of the far-|  
| mers appear by the hair to have been young or|  
|middle aged men; their being but sixty-seven  
very gray heads among them all ; which makes |  
\the service the more essential.  
  
**5. Containing eighty-eight scalps of women ; |  
hair long, braided in the Indian fashion, to show  
‘they were mothers; hoops blue; skin yellow |  
ground with little red tadpoles, to represent, by |  
way of triumph, the tears of grief occasioned to |  
&#x27;their relations ; a black scalping-knife or hatchet

by the elder Moore, the trader, and takeu down by  
me in writing :  
&quot;Father, we send you herewith mauv scalps, that you  
way see we are nut idle friends. (A blue belt.)  
&quot; Father, we wish you to send these scalps urer the water  
to the great King, that he may regard them, and he refreshed,  
and that he may sec our faithfulness in destroying  
his enemies, and be convinced that his presents have not hceii  
made to an ungrateful people. (A blue and white belt, with  
red tassels.)  
I &quot; Father, attend to what 1 am now going to say ; it is t  
1 mallei- of much woii/ht. The irreat Kinsr&#x27;s enemies are  
  
1 many, and tliojr prow fast in uuiiTbttrs. They were formerly  
j like youug panthers?they could neither bi&#x27;te nor scratch.  
We could play with tlieiu safely. We feared nothing they  
&quot; could do to us. Hut now their bodies have become us Dip at  
, the elk, and strong as the buffalo; they have ulso gut great  
and sharp claws. They have driven us out of our country foi  
~ taking part iu your quarrel. We expect the grcut King wil  
j j give us another country, that our children may live after us,  
| and be his friends uud children as w e are. Kay this for us U  
J j our great King; to enforce it, give this belt. (A great whiti  
_ belt, with blue tassels.)  
| &quot; Father, we have only to say further that your traderi  
e exact more than we can pay for their goods, and our hunt  
t ing is lessened by the war, so that we have fewer skins to giv&lt;  
for them. This ruins us. Think of some remedy. We art  
e poor, and you have plenty of everything. We know yoi  
will send us powder and guns; but vi e also want shirts anc  
blankets. (A little white belt.)  
e &quot; 1 do not doubt but that your excellency will think ii  
proper to give some further encouragement to those honesi  
people. Tlie high prices they complain of arc the necessary  
s effects of war.  
&quot; Whatever presents may be sunt for them through iuj  
hands shall be distributed witli prudence and fidelity.  
: &quot; 1 have the honor of being your excellency&#x27;s most obe  
r | dicnt and humble servant,

Franklin not to seize upon. “A pirate,” the  
Englishman was told, “is defined to be hostis  
humani generis (an enemy to all mankind).  
It happens, Sir, that I am an enemy to no  
part of mankind, except your nation, the  
English; which nation, at the same time,  
comes much more within the definition, being  
actually an enemy to, and at war with, one  
whole quarter of the world. . . . A pirate  
makes war for the sake of rapine. This is  
not the kind of war I am engaged in against  
England. Ours is a war in defence of liberty,  
the most just of all wars; and of our proper-  
ties, which your nation would have taken  
from us, without our consent, in violation of  
our rights, and by an armed force. Yours,  
therefore, is a war of rapine; of course a  
piratical war; and those who approve of it,  
and are engaged in it, more justly deserve  
the name of pirates, which you bestow on  
me.” Following this letter came a numbe
