Each Party endeavour’d to strengthen itself by obtaining the Authority of the Mayor, directing or forbidding a Maypole. He heard their Altercation with great Patience, and then gravely determin’d thus; You that are for having no Maypole shall have no Maypole; and you that are for having a Maypole shall have a Maypole.

Your People are therefore not to be censur’d for desiring no more among them than they have; and if I have any, I should certainly carry it where from its Scarcity it may probably come to a better Market.

“The church people and the Puritans in a  
country town had once a bitter contention con-  
cerning the erecting of a Maypole, which the  
former desired and the latter opposed. Each  
party endeavored to strengthen itself by ob-  
taining the authority of the mayor, directing  
or forbidding a Maypole. He heard their al-  
tercation with great patience, and then grave-  
ly determined thus: ‘You, that are for hav-  
ing no Maypole, shall have no Maypole; but  
you that are for having a Maypole, shall have  
a Maypole. Get about your business, and let  
me hear no more of this quarrel.’ ”’

 of mankind.”  
  
When Hume learned that Franklin was about to leave  
England, he wrote that he was very sorry that Franklin  
intended soon to leave the old hemisphere. “America has  
sent us many good things, gold, silver, sugar, tobacco, in-  
digo. But you are the first philosopher and indeed the first  
great man of letters for whom we are beholden to her.” In  
reply, Franklin wrote that the value of everything depends  
on the “proportion of the quantity to the demand.” Eng-  
land has plenty of wisdom. Hence, Franklin says he should  
market his share of this commodity “ where from its scarcity  
it may probably come to a better market.”
