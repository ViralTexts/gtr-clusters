a March 14. 1755.  
Electrical Experiments, made in pursuance of those per Mr. Canton, dated Decr. 3[6]. 1753. With Explanations by B.F.  
  
Principles.  
I. Electric Atmospheres that flow round non electric Bodies, being brought near each other, do not readily mix and unite into one Atmosphere, but remain separate and repel each other.  
This is plainly seen in suspended Cork Balls, and other Bodies electrified.  
II. An Electric Atmosphere not only repells another Electric Atmosphere, but will also repel the Electric Matter contained in the Substance of a Body approaching it; and without joyning or mixing with it, force it to other Parts of the Body that contained it.  
This is shown by some of the following Experiments.  
III. Bodies electrified negatively, or deprived of Part of their natural Quantity of Electricity, repel each other (or at least appear to do so, by a mutual Receding) as well as those electrified positively, or which have electric Atmospheres.  
This is shewn by applying the negatively charged Wire of a Phial to two Cork Balls suspended by Silk Threads, and by many other Experiments.  
  
Preparation  
Fix a Tassel of 15 or 20 Threads, 3 Inches long at one End of a Tin Prime Conductor; (mine is about 5 Feet long, and 4 Inches Diameter) supported by Silk Lines.  
Let the Threads be a little damp, but not wet.  
  
Experiment I.  
Pass an excited Glass Tube near the other End of the Prime Conductor, so as to give it some Sparks, and the Threads will diverge.  
Because each Thread as well as the Prime Conductor has acquired an electric Atmosphere, which repels and is repelled by the Atmospheres of the other Threads: If those several Atmospheres would readily mix, the Threads might unite and hang in the Middle of one Atmosphere common to them all.  
Rub the Tube afresh, and approach the Prime Conductor therewith, crossways, near that End, but not nigh enough to give Sparks, and the Threads will diverge a little more.  
Because the Atmosphere of the Prime Conductor is pressed by the Atmosphere of the excited Tube, and driven towards the End where the Threads are, by which each Thread acquires more Atmosphere.  
Withdraw the Tube, and they will close as much.  
They close as much, and no more, because the Atmosphere of the Glass Tube, not having mix’t with the Atmosphere of the Prime Conductor, is withdrawn intire, having made no Addition to, or Diminution from it.  
Bring the excited Tube under the Tuft of Threads, and they will close a little.  
They close, because the Atmosphere of the Glass Tube repels their Atmospheres, and drives Part of them back on the Prime Conductor.  
Withdraw it and they will diverge as much.  
For the Portion of Atmosphere they had lost returns to them again.  
  
Experiment II  
Excite the Glass Tube, and approach the Prime Conductor with it, holding it across near the opposite End to that on which the Threads hang, at the Distance of 5 or 6 Inches. Keep it there a few Seconds, and the Threads of the Tassels will diverge. Withdraw it and they will close.  
They diverge because they have received electric Atmospheres, from the electric Matter before contained in the Substance of the Prime Conductor: but which is now repelled and driven away, by the Atmosphere of the Glass Tube, from the Parts of the Prime Conductor opposite and nearest to that Atmosphere, and forced out upon the Surface of the Prime Conductor at it’s other End, and upon the Threads hanging thereto. Were it any Part of the Atmosphere of the Glass Tube that flowed over and along the Prime Conductor to the Threads and gave them Atmospheres (as in the Case when a Spark is given to the Prime Conductor from the Glass Tube) such Part of the Tubes Atmosphere would have remained, and the Threads continue to diverge; but they close, on withdrawing the Tube; because the Tube takes with it all its own Atmosphere, and the Electric Matter which had been driven out of the Substance of the Prime Conductor, and form’d Atmospheres round the Threads, is thereby permitted to return to it’s Place.  
Take a Spark from the Prime Conductor, near the Threads, when they are diverged as before, and they will close.  
For by so doing you take away their Atmospheres, composed of the Electric Matter driven out of the Substance of the Prime Conductor, as aforesaid, by the Repellency of the Atmosphere of the Glass Tube. By Taking this Spark you rob the Prime Conductor of part of it’s natural Quantity of the Electric Matter; which Part so taken is not supply’d by the Glass Tube, for when that is afterwards withdrawn, it takes with it it’s whole Atmosphere, and leaves the Prime Conductor electris’d negatively, as appears by the next operation.  
Then withdraw the Tube and they will open again.  
For now the Electric Matter in the Prime Conductor, returning to its Equilibrium or equal Diffusion in all Parts of its Substance, and the Prime Conductor having lost some of it’s natural Quantity, the Threads connected with it, lose Part of theirs, and so are electris’d negatively, and therefore repel each other, by Pr. III.  
Approach the Prime Conductor with the Tube near the same Place as at first, and they will close again.  
Because the Part of their natural Quantity of Electric Fluid which they had lost is now restored to them again by the Repulsion of the Glass Tube forcing that Fluid to them from other Parts of the Prime Conductor; so they are now again in their natural State.  
  
Withdraw it and they will open again.  
For what had been restored to them is now taken from them again, flowing back into the Prime Conductor, and leaving them once more electris’d negatively.  
Bring the excited Tube under the Threads, and they will diverge more.  
Because more of their natural Quantity is driven from them into the Prime Conductor, and thereby their negative Electricity increased.  
  
Experiment III  
The Prime Conductor not being electrified, bring the excited Tube under the Tassel, and the Threads will diverge.  
Part of their natural Quantity is thereby driven out of them into the Prime Conductor, and they become negatively electrised, and therefore repell each other.  
Keeping the Tube in the same Place with one Hand, attempt to touch the Threads with the Finger of the other Hand, and they will recede from the Finger.  
Because the Finger being plung’d into the Atmosphere of the Glass Tube as well as the Threads, Part of its natural Quantity is driven back thro’ the Hand and Body by that Atmosphere, and the Finger becomes, as well as the Threads, negatively electrised, and so repels and is repelled by them. To confirm this, Hold a Slender light Lock of Cotton two or three Inches long, near a Prime Conductor that is electrified by a Glass Globe or Tube. You will see the Cotton stretch it self out towards the Prime Conductor. Attempt to touch it with the Finger of the other Hand, and it will be repelled by the Finger. Approach it with a positively Charg’d Wire of a Bottle, and it will fly to the Wire. Bring near it a negatively charg’d Wire of a Bottle, it will recede from that Wire in the same manner that it did from the Finger; which demonstrates the Finger to be negatively electrised, as well as the Lock of Cotton so situated.

Principles.  
  
Leétric atmofpheres, that flow round  
  
non-electric bodies, being brought  
  
near each other, do not readily mix and  
  
  
  
  
Eleftrical Experiments explained.  
  
unite into one atmofphere, but remain fe.  
parate, and repel each other.  
  
This is plainly feen in fufpended cork  
balls, and other bodies ele€trified.  
  
II. An eleétric atmoiphere not only re-  
pels another cleétric utmofphere, but will  
alfo rep:] the eleétric matter contained in  
the fubitance of a body approaching it;  
and without joining or mixing with it,  
force it to other parts of the body that  
contained it.  
  
‘This is fhewn by fome of the following  
experiments.  
  
Ill. Bodies electrified negatively, or  
deprived of their natural quantity of elec-  
tricity, repel each other, (or at leaft ap-  
pear to do fo by a mutual receding) as  
well as thoie electrified pofitively, or which  
have eleétric atmofpheres.  
  
This is fhewn by applying the nega-  
tively charged-wire of a phial to two cork  
balis, fufpended by filk threads, and by  
many other experiments.  
  
Preparation.  
  
Fix a taffel of 15 or 20 threads, 3  
inches long, at one end of a tin prime  
conductor; (mine is about 5 feet long,  
and 4 inches diameter) fupported by filk  
lines.  
  
Let the threads be a little damp, but not  
wet.  
  
EXPERIMENT I,  
Pafs an excited glajs tube near the other  
end of tke prime condudior, fa as to give  
  
it fome fparks, and the threads will di-  
  
verge.  
  
Becaufe each thread, as well as the  
prime conduétor, has acquired an elaftic  
atmofphere, which repels, and is repelled  
by the atmofpheres of the other threads;  
if thofe feveral atmofpheres would readily  
mix, the threads might unite, and hang  
in the middle of one atmofphere com-  
mon to them all.  
  
  
  
—  
  
  
  
Rub the tube afrefh, and approach the prime |  
conductor therewtih, croffways, near |  
that end, but nigh enough to give fparks; |  
and the threads will diverge a little  
more.  
  
Becaufe the atmofphere of the prime  
conductor is preffed by the atmofphere of  
the excited tube, and driven towards the f  
end where the threads are, by which each  
thyead acquires more atmolphere.  
Withdraw the tube, and they will clofe @  
  
much.  
  
They clofe as much, and no more, be

having made no addition to, or diminution  
  
from it.  
  
Bring the excited tube under the tuft of  
threads, and they will clofe a little.  
They clofe, becaufe the atmofphere of  
  
the giafs tube repels their atmofpheres,  
  
and drives part of them back on the prime  
conduétor. of 1m  
  
Withdraw it, and they ewill diverge as  
much.  
  
For the portion of atmofphere, which  
they had loft, returns to them again.  
EXPERIMENT II.  
  
Excite the glafs tube, and approach the  
prime conductor with it, holding tt acrofs  
near the oppofite end to that om which  
the threads hang, at the diftance of § or  
6 inches. Keep it there a few feconds,  
and the threads of the taffels will di-  
verge. Withdraw it, and they willclofe.  
They diverge, becaufe they have re-  
  
ceived eleétric atmofpheres from the elec-  
tric matter before contained in the fub-  
ftance of the prime conductor; but which  
is now repelled and driven gy by the  
atmofphere of the glafs tube, from the  
parts of the prime conductor, oppofite and  
neareft to that atmofphere, and torced out  
upon the furface of the prime conduétor  
at its other end, and upon the threads  
hanging thereto. Were it any part of  
the atmofphere of the glafs tube, that  
flowed over and along the prime con-  
ductor to the threads, and gave them at-  
mofpheres (as in the cafe when a {park is  
given to the prime conduétor, from the  
glafs tube) fuch part of the tube’s at-  
mo{phere would have remained, and the  
threads continue to diverge; but they clofe  
on withdrawing the tube, becaufe the tube  
takes with it all its own atmofpbere, and  
the eleftric matter, which had been driven  
out of the fubftance of the prime con-  
ductor, and formed atmofpheres round  
the threads, is thereby permitted to re-  
turn to its place.  
  
Take a fpark from the prime conductor,  
near the threads, «when they are di-  
verged as before, and they will clofe.  
For by fo doing you take away their  
  
atmolpheres, compoted of the eleéiric mat-  
  
ter driven out of the fubftance of the prime  
conduétor, as aforefaid, by the repellency  
of the atmofphere of the glafs tube. By  
taking this {park you rob the prime con-  
duor of part of its natural quantity of  
the electric matter; which part fo taken is  
not fupplied by the glafs tube, for when  
that is afterwards withdrawn, it takes with  
it its whale atmofphere, and leaves the  
  
prime conductor ele&amp;trifed negatively, as  
  
appears by the next operation.  
  
Then withdraw the tube, and they will  
open again.  
  
For now the electric matter in the prime  
conductor, returning to its equilibrium,  
or equal diufion, in all parts of its fub-  
ftance, and the prime conduétor having  
loft fome of its natural quantity, the threads  
connected with it lofe part of theirs, and  
fo are electrifed negatively, and therefore  
repel each other, by ¢riz. III.  
Approach the prime condu€tor with the tube  
  
near the fame place as at firf, and  
  
they will clofe again.  
  
Becaufe the part of their natural quan-  
tity of electric fluid, which they had loft,  
is now reitored to them again, by the re-  
pulfion of the glafs tube forcing that fluid  
to them from other parts of the prime con-  
ductor: fo they are now again in their  
natural ftate.  
  
Withdraw it, and they will open again.  
For what had been reftored to them is  
  
now taken from them again, flowing back  
  
into the prime cuniialies and leaving  
them once more eleétrifed negatively.  
  
Bring the excited tube under the threads,  
and they will diverge more.  
  
Becaufe more of their natural quantity  
isdriven from them into the prime con-  
ductor, and thereby their negative eleétri-  
city increafed.  
  
EXPERIMENT III.  
  
The prime conductor not being eleGrified,  
bring the excited tube under the taffl,  
and the threads will diverge.  
  
Part of their natural quantity is thereby  
driven out of them in the prime conduétor,  
and they become negatively eleétrifed, and  
therefore repel each other.  
  
Keeping the tube in the fame place with one  
hand, attempt to touch the threads with  
the finger of the other hand, and they  
will recede from the finger.  
  
Becaufe the finger being plunged into  
the atmofphere of the glafs tube, as well  
as the threads, part of its natural quan-  
tity is driven back through the hand and  
body, by that atmofphere, and the finger  
becomes, as well as the threads, nega-  
tively electrifed, and fo repels, and is re-  
pelled by them. To confirm this, hold  
a flender light lock of cotton, two or three  
inches long, near a prime conduétor, that  
is eleftrified by a gla{s globe or tube. You  
will fee the cotton ftretch itfelf out to-  
wards the prime conduétor. Attempt to  
touch it with your finger of the other  
hand, and it willbe repelled by the fin-

wire. Bring near it a negatively charged  
wire of a bottle, it will recede from that  
wire in the fame manner, that it did from  
the finger; which demonftrates the finger  
to be negatively electrifed, as well as the

negatively electrified. On withdrawing the tube, the electric matter on  
the conductor recovers its equilibrium, or equal diffusion, and the con-

will see the cotton stretch itself out towards the conductor. Attempt  
to touch it with the finger of the other hand, and it will be repelled by  
the finger. Approach it with a positively charged wire of a bottle, and  
it will fly to the wire. Bring it near a negatively charged wire of a  
bottle, it will recede from that wire in the same manner that it did from  
the finger, which demonstrates that the finger was negatively electrified  
as well as the cotton.*
