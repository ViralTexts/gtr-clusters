An Account Of the New-Invented Fire-Places.  
In these Northern Colonies the Inhabitants keep Fires to sit by, generally Seven Months in the Year; that is, from the Beginning of October to the End of April; and in some Winters near Eight Months, by taking in part of September and May.  
Wood, our common Fewel, which within these 100 Years might be had at every Man’s Door, must now be fetch’d near 100 Miles to some Towns, and makes a very considerable Article in the Expence of Families.  
As therefore so much of the Comfort and Conveniency of our Lives, for so great a Part of the Year, depends on the Article of Fire; since Fuel is become so expensive, and (as the Country is more clear’d and settled) will of course grow scarcer and dearer; any new Proposal for Saving the Wood, and for lessening the Charge and augmenting the Benefit of Fire, by some particular Method of Making and Managing it, may at least be thought worth Consideration.  
The New Fire-Places are a late Invention to that purpose (experienced now three Winters by a great Number of Families in Pennsylvania) of which this Paper is intended to give a particular Account.  
That the Reader may the better judge whether this Method of Managing Fire has any Advantage over those heretofore in Use, it may be proper to consider both the old and new Methods separately and particularly, and afterwards make the Comparison.

lighter than it was before, and will rise in other Air of greater Density. As Wood, Oil, or any other Matter specifically lighter than Water, if plac’d at the Bottom of a Vessel of Water, will rise till it comes to the Top; so rarified Air will rise in common Air, till it either comes to Air of equal Weight, or is by Cold reduc’d to its former Density.  
A Fire then being made in any Chimney, the Air over the Fire is rarified by the Heat, becomes lighter and therefore immediately rises in the Funnel and goes out; the other Air in the Room (flowing towards the Chimney) supplies its Place, is rarified in its turn, and rises likewise; the Place of the Air thus carried out of the Room is supplied by fresh Air coming in thro’ Doors and Windows, or, if they be shut, thro’ every Crevice with Violence, as may be seen by holding a Candle to a Keyhole: If the Room be so tight as that all the Crevices together will not supply so much Air as is continually carried off, then in a little time the Current up the Funnel must flag, and the Smoke being no longer driven up must come into the Room.  
1. Fire  
†i.e. Common Fire.  
throws out Light, Heat, and Smoke (or Fume). The two first move in right Lines and with great Swiftness; the latter is but just separated from the Fuel, and then moves only as it is carried by the Stream of rarified Air. And without a continual Accession and Recession of Air to carry off the Smoaky Fumes, they would remain crouded about the Fire, and stifle it.  
2. Heat may be separated from the Smoke as well as from the Light, by means of a Plate of Iron, which will suffer Heat to pass through it without the others.  
3. Fire sends out its Rays of Heat, as well as Rays of Light, equally every way: But the greatest sensible Heat is over the Fire, where there is, besides the Rays of Heat shot upwards, a continual rising Stream of hot Air, heated by the Rays shot round on every Side.  
  
These Things being understood, we proceed to consider the Fire-places heretofore in Use, viz.  
1. The large open Fire-places used in the Days of our Fathers, and still generally in the Country, and in Kitchens.  
2. The newer-fashion’d Fire-places, with low Breasts, and narrow Hearths.  
3. Fire-places with hollow Backs, Hearths and Jams of Iron, (described by Mons. Gauger  
*In his Tract entitled, La Mechanique de Feu.  
) for warming the Air as it comes into the Room.  
4. The Holland Stoves, with Iron Doors opening into the Room.  
5. The German Stoves, which have no Opening in the Room where they are us’d, but the Fire is put in from some other Room, or from without.  
6. Iron Pots, with open Charcoal Fires, plac’d in the middle of a Room.  
1. The first of these Methods has generally the Conveniency of two warm Seats, one in each Corner; but they are sometimes too hot to abide in, and at other times incommoded with the Smoke; there is likewise good Room for the Cook to move, to hang on Pots, &amp;c. Their Inconveniencies are, that they almost always smoke if the Door be not left open; that they require a large Funnel, and a large Funnel carries off a great Quantity of Air, which occasions what is called a strong Draft to the Chimney; without which strong Draft the Smoke would come out of some Part or other of so large an Opening, so that the Door can seldom be shut; and the cold Air so nips the Backs and Heels of those that sit before the Fire, that they have no Comfort, ’till either Screens or Settles are provided (at a considerable Expence) to keep it off, which both cumber the Room and darken the Fireside. A moderate Quantity of Wood on the Fire in so large a Hearth, seems but little; and, in so strong and cold a Draught, warms but little; so that People are continually laying on more. In short, ’tis next to impossible to warm a Room with such a Fire-place: And I suppose our Ancestors never thought of warming Rooms to sit in; all they purpos’d was to have a Place to make a Fire in, by which they might warm themselves when acold.  
2. Most of these old-fashion’d Chimneys in Towns and Cities, have been, of late Years, reduc’d to the second Sort mention’d, by building Jambs within them, narrowing the Hearth, and making a low Arch or Breast. ’Tis strange, methinks, that tho’ Chimneys have been so long in Use, their Construction should be so little understood till lately, that no Workman pretended to make one which should always carry off all the Smoke, but a Chimney-cloth was look’d upon as essential to a Chimney: This Improvement, however, by small Openings and low Breasts, has been made in our Days; and Success in the first Experiments has brought it into general Use in Cities, so that almost all new Chimneys are now made of that sort, and much fewer Bricks will make a Stack of Chimneys now than formerly. An Improvement so lately made, may give us Room to believe that still farther Improvements may be found, to remedy the Inconveniencies yet remaining. For these new Chimneys, tho’ they keep Rooms generally free from Smoke, and, the Opening being contracted, will allow the Door to be shut, yet the Funnel still requiring a considerable Quantity of Air, it rushes in at every Crevice so strongly, as to make a continual Whistling or Howling; and ’tis very uncomfortable as well as dangerous to sit against any such Crevice. Many Colds are caught from this Cause only; it being safer to sit in the open Street; for then the Pores do all close together, and the Air does not strike so sharply against any particular Part. The Spaniards have a Proverbial Saying, If the Wind blows on you thro’ a Hole, Make your Will, and take Care of your Soul. Women, particularly, from this Cause, (as they sit much in the House) get Colds in the Head, Rheums and Defluctions, which fall into their Jaws and Gums, and have destroy’d early many a fine Set of Teeth in these Northern Colonies. Great and bright Fires do also very much contribute to damage the Eyes, dry and shrivel the Skin, and bring on early the Appearances of Old-Age. In short, many of the Diseases proceeding from Colds, as Fevers, Pleurisies, &amp;c. fatal to very great Numbers of People, may be ascrib’d to strong-drawing Chimneys, whereby, in severe Weather, a Man is scorch’d before, while he’s froze behind.

Was a Man, even in a Sweat, to leap into a cold Bath, or jump from his warm Bed in the intensest Cold, even in a Frost, provided he do not continue over-long therein, and be in Health when he does this, we see by Experience that he gets no Harm. If he sits a little while against a Window, into which a successive Current of cold Air comes, his Pores are closed, and he gets a Fever. In the first Case, the Shock the Body endures is general, uniform, and therefore less fierce; in the other a single Part, a Neck or Ear perchance, is attacked, and that with the greater Violence probably, as it is done by a successive Stream of cold Air.

.  
In both these Sorts of Fire-places, the greatest Part of the Heat from the Fire is lost: For as Fire naturally darts Heat every way, the Back, the two Jambs, and the Hearth, drink up almost all that’s given them, very little being reflected from Bodies so dark, porous and unpolish’d; and the upright Heat, which is by far the greatest, flies directly up the Chimney. Thus Five Sixths at least of the Heat (and consequently of the Fewel) is wasted, and contributes nothing towards warming the Room.  
  
3. To remedy this, the Sieur Gauger gives us, in his Book entitled La Mechanique de Feu, published 1709, seven different Constructions of the third Sort of Chimneys mentioned above, in which there are hollow Cavities made by Iron Plates in the Back, Jambs and Hearth, thro’ which Plates the Heat passing, warms the Air in those Cavities, which is continually coming into the Room fresh and warm. The Invention was very ingenious, and had many Conveniencies: The Room was warm’d in all Parts, by the Air flowing into it through the heated Cavities: Cold Air was prevented rushing thro’ the Crevices, the Funnel being sufficiently supply’d by those Cavities: Much less Fuel would serve, &amp;c. But the first Expence, which was very great; the Intricacy of the Design, and the Difficulty of the Execution, especially in old Chimneys, discouraged the Propagation of the Invention; so that there are (I suppose) very few such Chimneys now in Use. [The upright Heat, too, was almost all lost in these, as in the common Chimneys.]  
4. The Holland Iron Stove, which has a Flue proceeding from the Top, and a small Iron Door opening into the Room, comes next to be considered. Its Conveniences are, that it makes a Room all over warm; for the Chimney being wholly closed, except the Flue of the Stove, very little Air is required to supply that, and therefore not much rushes in at Crevices, or at the Door when ’tis opened. Little Fewel serves, the Heat being almost all saved; for it rays out almost equally from the four Sides, the Bottom and the Top, into the Room, and presently warms the Air around it, which being rarified rises to the Cieling, and its Place is supplied by the lower Air of the Room, which flows gradually towards the Stove, and is there warm’d and rises in its Turn, so that there is a continual Circulation till all the Air in the Room is warmed. The Air, too, is gradually changed by the Stove-Door’s being in the Room, thro’ which, part of it is continually passing, and that makes these Stoves wholesomer, or at least pleasanter, than the German Stoves next to be spoke of. But they have these Inconveniences. There is no Sight of the Fire, which is in itself a pleasant Thing. One cannot conveniently make any other Use of the Fire but that of warming the Room. When the Room is warm, People not seeing the Fire are apt to forget supplying it with Fuel ’til ’tis almost out, then, growing cold, a great deal of Wood is put in, which soon makes it too hot. The Change of Air is not carried on quite quick enough, so that if any Smoke or ill Smell happens in the Room, ’tis a long Time before ’tis discharg’d. For these Reasons the Holland Stove has not obtain’d much among the English (who love the Sight of the Fire) unless in some Workshops, where People are oblig’d to sit near Windows for the Light, and in such Places they have been found of good Use.  
5. The German Stove is like a Box, one Side wanting. ’Tis compos’d of Five Iron Plates scru’d together; and fix’d so as that you may put the Fuel into it from another Room, or from the Outside of the House. ’Tis a kind of Oven revers’d, its Mouth being without, and Body within the Room that is to be warm’d by it. This Invention certainly warms a Room very speedily and thoroughly with little Fuel: No Quantity of cold Air comes in at any Crevice, because there is no Discharge of Air which it might Supply, there being no Passage into the Stove from the Room. These are its Conveniencies. Its Inconveniences are, That People have not even so much Sight or Use of the Fire as in the Holland Stoves, and are moreover oblig’d to breathe the same unchang’d Air continually, mix’d with the Breath and Perspiration from one anothers Bodies, which is very disagreeable to those who have not been accustomed to it.  
6. Charcoal Fires, in Pots, are us’d chiefly in the Shops of Handicraftsmen. They warm a Room (that is kept close and has no Chimney to carry off the warm’d Air) very speedily and uniformly: But there being no Draught to change the Air, the sulphurous Fumes from the Coals [be they ever so well kindled before they are brought in, there will be some] mix with it, render it disagreeable, hurtful to some Constitutions, and sometimes, when the Door is long kept shut, produce fatal Consequences.  
To avoid the several Inconveniences, and at the same time retain all the Advantages of other Fire-places, was contrived the Pennsylvania Fire-place now to be described.

 Order.  
(i) The Bottom Plate, or Hearth-Piece, is round before, with a rising Moulding that serves as a Fender to keep Coals and Ashes from coming to the Floor, &amp;c. It has two Ears, F G, perforated to receive the Screw-Rods O P; a long Air-hole, a a, thro’ which the fresh outward Air passes up into the Air-Box; and three Smoke-Holes B C thro’ which the Smoke descends and passes away; also a square Hole b for the Bellows; all represented by dark Squares. It has also double Ledges to receive between them the Bottom Edges of the Back-Plate, the two Side Plates, and the two middle Plates. These Ledges are about an Inch asunder, and half an Inch high; a Profile of two of them join’d to a Fragment of Plate appears in Fig. 3.  
(ii) The Back Plate is without Holes, having only a Pair of Ledges on each Side, to receive the Back Edges of the two  
(iii iii) Side Plates: These have each a Pair of Ledges to receive the Side-Edges of the Front Plate, and a little Shoulder for it to rest on; also two Pair of Ledges to receive the Side-Edges of the two Middle Plates which form the Air-Box; and an oblong Airhole near the Top, thro’ which is discharg’d into the Room the Air warm’d in the Air-Box. Each has also a Wing or Bracket, H and I, to keep in falling Brands, Coals, &amp;c. and a small Hole Q and R, for the Axis of the Register to turn in.  
(iv iv) The Air-Box is compos’d of the two Middle Plates D E and F G. The first has five thin Ledges or Partitions, cast on it, two Inches deep, the Edges of which are receiv’d in so many Pair of Ledges cast in the other. The Tops of all the Cavities form’d by these thin deep Ledges are also covered by a Ledge of the same Form and Depth, cast with them; so that when the Plates are put together, and the Joints luted, there is no Communication between the Air-Box and the Smoke. In the winding Passages of this Box, fresh Air is warm’d as it passes into the Room.  
(v) The Front Plate is arch’d on the under Side, and ornamented with Foliages, &amp;c. It has no Ledges.  
(vi) The Top Plate has a Pair of Ears M N, answerable to those in the Bottom Plate, and perforated for the same Purpose: It has also a Pair of Ledges running round the under Side, to receive the Top-Edges of the Front, Back and Side Plates. The Air-Box does not reach up to the Top Plate by two Inches and half.  
(vii) The Shutter is of thin wrought Iron and light, of such a Length and Breadth as to close well the Opening of the Fire-Place. It is us’d to blow up the Fire, and to shut up and secure it a Nights. It has two brass Knobs for Handles d d, and commonly slides up and down in a Groove, left, in putting up the Fire-place, between the foremost Ledge of the Side Plates, and the Face of the Front Plate; but some choose to set it aside when it is not in Use, and apply it on Occasion.  
(viii) The Register, is also of thin wrought Iron. It is plac’d between the Back Plate and Air-Box, and can, by Means of the Key S be turn’d on its Axis so as to lie in any Position between level and upright.  
The Screw-Rods O P are of wrought Iron, about a third of an Inch thick, with a Button at Bottom, and a Screw and Nut at Top; and may be ornamented with two small Brasses screw’d on above the Nuts.  
To put this Machine to work,  
1. A false Back of four Inch- (or, in shallow small Chimneys, two Inch-) Brick-work is to be made in the Chimney, four Inches or more from the true Back: From the Top of this false Back, a Closing is to be made over to the Breast of the Chimney, that no Air may pass into the Chimney, but what goes under the false Back, and up behind it.  
2. Some Bricks of the Hearth are to be taken up, to form a Hollow under the Bottom Plate; across which Hollow runs a thin tight Partition to keep apart the Air entring the Hollow, and the Smoke; and is therefore plac’d between the Air-hole and Smoke-holes.  
3. A Passage is made, communicating with the outward Air, to introduce that Air into the forepart of the Hollow under the Bottom Plate, whence it may rise thro’ the Air-hole into the Air-box.  
4. A Passage is made from the back Part of the Hollow, communicating with the Flue behind the false Back: Through this Passage the Smoke is to pass.  
The Fire-place is to be erected upon these Hollows, by putting all the Plates in their Places, and screwing them

y observing the following  
  
Profile of the Chimney and Fire-Place  
  
The Fire being made at A, the Flame and Smoke will ascend and strike the Top T, which will thereby receive a considerable Heat. The Smoke finding no Passage upwards, turns over the Top of the Air-box, and descends between it and the Back Plate to the Holes at B in the Bottom Plate, heating, as it passes, both Plates of the Air-box and the said Back Plate; the Front Plate, Bottom and Side Plates are also all heated at the same Time. The Smoke proceeds in the Passage that leads it under and behind the false Back, and so rises into the Chimney. The Air justof the Room, warm’d behind the Back Plate, and by the Sides, Front and Top Plates, becoming specifically lighter than the other Air in the Room, is oblig’d to rise; but the Closure over the Fire-place hindring it from going up the Chimney, it is forc’d out into the Room, rises by the Mantle-piece to the Cieling and spreads all over the Top of the Room, whence being crouded down gradually by the Stream of newly warm’d Air that follows and rises above it, the whole Room becomes in a short time equally warmed.  
At the same Time the Air, warmed under the Bottom Plate and in the Air-Box, rises, and comes out of the Holes in the Side-Plates, very swiftly if the Door of the Room be shut, and joins its Current with the Stream before mentioned rising from the Side, Back and Top Plates.  
  
The Air that enters the Room thro’ the Air-box is fresh, tho’ warm; and computing the Swiftness of its Motion with the Areas of the Holes, ’tis found that near 10 Barrels of fresh Air are hourly introduc’d by the Air-Box; and by this Means the Air in the Room is continually changed, and kept at the same Time sweet and warm.  
’Tis to be observed that the entring Air will not be warm at first Lighting the Fire, but heats gradually as the Fire encreases.  
A square Opening for a Trap-Door should be left in the Closing of the Chimney, for the Sweeper to go up: The Door may be made of Slate or Tin, and commonly kept close shut, but so plac’d as that turning up against the Back of the Chimney when open, it closes the Vacancy behind the false Back, and shoots the Soot that falls in Sweeping, out upon the Hearth.

Your Cord-wood must be cut into three Lengths; or else a short Piece, fit for the Fire-place, cut off, and the longer left for the Kitchin or other Fires. Dry Hickery, or Ash, or any Woods that burn with a clear Flame, are rather to be chosen; because such are less apt to foul the Smoke-Passages with Soot; and Flame communicates, with its Light, as well as by Contact, greater Heat to the Plates and Room. But where more ordinary Wood is used, half a dry Faggot of Brush-wood burnt at the first making of Fire in the Morning, is very advantageous; as it immediately by its sudden Blaze heats the Plates and warms the Room (which with bad Wood slowly kindling would not be done so soon) and at the same time, by the Length of its Flame turning in the Passages, consumes and cleanses away the Soot that such bad smoaky Wood had produc’d therein the preceding Day, and so keeps them always free and clean. When you have laid a little Back-log, and plac’d your Billets on small Dogs, as in common Chimneys, and put some Fire to them; then slide down your Shutter as low as the Dogs, and the Opening being by that Means contracted, the Air rushes in briskly and presently blows up the Flames.

rmed. At Night when you go to Bed, cover the Coals or Brands with Ashes as usual; then take away the Dogs and slide down the Shutter close to the Bottom-Plate, sweeping a little Ashes against it that no Air may pass under it; then turn the Register, so as very near to stop the Flue behind. If no Smoke then comes out at Crevices into the Room, ’tis right: If any Smoke is perceiv’d to come out, move the Register so as to give a little Draught, and ’twill go the right way. Thus the Room will be kept warm all Night; for the Chimney being almost entirely stopt, very little, if any, cold Air will enter the Room at any Crevice. When you come to rekindle the Fire in the Morning, turn open the Register before you lift up the Slider, otherwise if there be any Smoke in the Fire-Place, it will come out into the Room. By the same Use of the Shutter and Register, a blazing Fire may be presently stifled, as well as secured, when you have Occasion to leave it for any Time; and at your Return, you will find the Brands warm and ready for a speedy Re-kindling. The Shutter alone will not stifle a Fire; for it cannot well be made to fit so exactly, but that Air will enter, and that in a violent Stream, so as to blow up and keep alive the Flames, and consume the Wood, if the Draught be not check’d by turning the Register to shut the Flue behind. The Register has also two other Uses. If you observe the Draught of Air into your Fire-place, to be stronger than is necessary, (as in extream cold Weather it often is) so that the Wood is consum’d faster than usual; in that Case, a quarter, half, or two thirds Turn of the Register, will check the Violence of the Draught, and let your Fire burn with the Moderation you desire: And at the same Time both the Fire-Place and the Room will be the warmer, because less cold Air will enter and pass through them. And if the Chimney should happen to take Fire (which indeed there is very little Danger of, if the preceding Direction be observ’d in making Fires, and it be well swept once a Year; for, much less Wood being burnt, less Soot is proportionably made; and the Fuel being soon blown into Flame by the Shutter (or the Trap-door Bellows) there is consequently less Smoke from the Fuel to make Soot; then, tho’ the Funnel should be foul, yet the Sparks have such a crooked up and down round-about Way to go, that they are out before they get at it) I say, if it should ever be on fire, a Turn of the Register shuts all close, and prevents any Air going into the Chimney, and so the Fire may be easily stifled and mastered.  
  
The Advantages of this Fire-place.  
Its Advantages above the common Fire-Places are,  
1. That your whole Room is equally warmed; so that People need not croud so close round the Fire, but may sit near the Window and have the Benefit of the Light for Reading, Writing, Needle-work, &amp;c. They may sit with Comfort in any Part of the Room; which is a very considerable Advantage in a large Family, where there must often be two Fires kept, because all cannot conveniently come at One.  
  
2. If you sit near the Fire, you have not that cold Draught of uncomfortable Air nipping your Back and Heels, as when before common Fires, by which many catch Cold, being scorcht before and as it were froze behind.  
3. If you sit against a Crevice, there is not that sharp Draught of cold Air playing on you, as in Rooms where there are Fires in the common way; by which many catch Cold, whence proceed Coughs, Catarrhs,  
*My Lord Molesworth, in his Account of Denmark, says, That “few or none of the People there, are troubled with Coughs, Catarrhs, Consumptions, or such like diseases of the Lungs; so that in the Midst of Winter in the Churches, which are very much frequented, there is no Noise to interrupt the Attention due to the Preacher. I am persuaded (says he) their warm Stoves contribute to their Freedom from these kind of Maladies.” Page 91.  
Tooth-Achs, Fevers, Pleurisies and many other Diseases.  
4. In Case of Sickness, they make most excellent Nursing-Rooms; as they constantly supply a Sufficiency of fresh Air, so warmed at the same time as to be no way inconvenient or dangerous. A small One does well in a Chamber; and, the Chimneys being fitted for it, it may be remov’d from one Room to another as Occasion requires, and fix’d in half an Hour. The equal Temper, too, and Warmth, of the Air of the Room, is thought to be particularly advantageous in some Distempers: For ’twas observ’d in the Winters of 1730 and 1736, when the Small-Pox spread in Pennsylvania, that very few of the Children of the Germans died of that Distemper, in Proportion to those of the English; which was ascrib’d by some to the Warmth and equal Temper of Air in their Stove-Rooms; which made the Disease as favourable as it commonly is in the West-Indies. But this Conjecture we submit to the Judgment of Physicians.  
5. In common Chimneys the strongest Heat from the Fire, which is upwards, goes directly up the Chimney, and is lost; and there is such a strong Draught into the Chimney, that not only the upright Heat, but also the back, sides and downward Heats, are carried up the Chimney by that Draught of Air; and the Warmth given before the Fire by the Rays that strike out towards the Room, is continually driven back, crouded into the Chimney, and carried up, by the same Draught of Air.

d that comes into the Room. The Heat likewise which the Fire communicates to the Sides, Back, Bottom and Air-Box, is all brought into the Room; for you will find a constant Current of warm Air coming out of the Chimney-Corner into the Room. Hold a Candle just under the Mantle-Piece or Breast of your Chimney, and you will see the Flame bent outwards: By laying a Piece of smoaking Paper on the Hearth, on either Side, you may see how the Current of Air moves, and where it tends, for it will turn and carry the Smoke with it.

re-places, differ much in their Accounts of the Wood saved by them. Some say five sixths, others three fourths, and others much less. This is owing to the great Difference there was in their former Fires; some (according to the different Circumstances of their Rooms and Chimneys) having been us’d to make very large, others middling, and others, of a more sparing Temper, very small Ones: While in these Fire-Places, (their Size and Draught being nearly the same) the Consumption is more equal. I suppose, taking a Number of Families together, that two thirds, or half the Wood at least, is saved. My common Room, I know, is made twice as warm as it used to be, with a quarter of the Wood I formerly consum’d there.  
will serve you, which is a considerable Advantage where Wood is dear.  
7. When you burn Candles near this Fire-Place, you will find that the Flame burns quite upright, and does not blare and run the Tallow down, by drawing towards the Chimney, as against common Fires.  
8. This Fire-place cures most smoaky Chimneys, and thereby preserves both the Eyes and Furniture.  
9. It prevents the Fouling of Chimneys; much of the Lint and Dust that contributes to foul a Chimney, being by the low Arch oblig’d to pass thro’ the Flame, where ’tis consum’d. Then, less Wood being burnt, there is less Smoke made. Again, the Shutter, or Trap-Bellows, soon blowing the Wood into a Flame, the same Wood does not yield so much Smoke as if burnt in a common Chimney: For as soon as Flame begins, Smoke, in proportion, ceases.  
10. And if a Chimney should be foul, ’tis much less likely to take Fire. If it should take Fire, ’tis easily stifled and extinguished.  
11. A Fire may be very speedily made in this Fire-Place, by the Help of the Shutter, or Trap-Bellows, as aforesaid.  
12. A Fire may be soon extinguished, by closing it with the Shutter before, and turning the Register behind, which will stifle it, and the Brands will remain ready to rekindle.  
13. The Room being once warm, the Warmth may be retain’d in it all Night.  
14. And lastly, the Fire is so secur’d at Night, that not one Spark can fly out into the Room to do Damage.  
With all these Conveniencies, you do not lose the pleasant Sight nor Use of the Fire, as in the Dutch Stoves, but may boil the Tea-Kettle, warm the Flat-Irons, heat Heaters, keep warm a Dish of Victuals by setting it on the Top, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.  
  
Objections answered.  
There are some Objections commonly made by People that are unacquainted with these Fire-Places, which it may not be amiss to endeavour to remove, as they arise from Prejudices which might otherwise obstruct in some Degree the general Use of this beneficial Machine. We frequently hear it said, They are of the Nature of the Dutch Stoves; Stoves have an unpleasant Smell; Stoves are unwholesome; and, Warm Rooms make People tender ana apt to catch Cold. As to the first, that they are of the Nature of Dutch Stoves, the Description of those Stoves in the Beginning of this Paper, compar’d with that of these Machines, shows that there is a most material Difference, and that these have vastly the Advantage, if it were only in the single Article of the Admission and Circulation of fresh Air. But it must be allowed there has been some Cause to complain of the offensive Smell of Iron Stoves. This Smell, however, never proceeded from the Iron itself, which in its Nature, whether hot or cold, is one of the sweetest of Metals, but from the general uncleanly Manner of using those Stoves. If they are kept clean, they are as sweet as an Ironing-Box, which, tho’ ever so hot, never offends the Smell of the nicest Lady: But it is common, to let them be greased by setting Candl

sticks on them, or otherwise; to rub greasy Hands on them, and, above all, to spit upon them to try how hot they are, which is an inconsiderate, filthy unmannerly Custom; for the slimy Matter of Spittle drying on, burns and fumes when the Stove is hot, as well as the Grease, and smells most nauseously; which makes such close Stove-Rooms, where there is no Draught to carry off those filthy Vapours, almost intolerable to those that are not from their Infancy accustomed to them. At the same time, nothing is more easy than to keep them clean; for when by any Accident they happen to be fouled, a Lee made of Ashes and Water, with a Brush, will scour them perfectly; as will also a little strong Soft-Soap and Water.  
That hot Iron of itself gives no offensive Smell, those know very well, who have (as the Writer of this has) been present at a Furnace, when the Workmen were pouring out the flowing Metal to cast large Plates, and not the least Smell of it to be perceived. That hot Iron does not, like Lead, Brass, and some other Metals, give out unwholesome Vapours, is plain from the general Health and Strength of those who constantly work in Iron, as Furnace-men, Forge-Men, and Smiths; That it is in its Nature a Metal perfectly wholesome to the Body of Man, is known from the beneficial Use of Chalybeat or Iron-Mine Waters; from the Good done by taking Steel Filings in several Disorders; and that even the Smithy Water in which hot Irons are quench’d, is found advantageous to the human Constitution. The ingenious and learned Dr. Desaguliers, to whose instructive Writings the Contriver of this Machine acknowledges himself much indebted, relates an Experiment he made, to try whether heated Iron would yield u

a Cube of Iron, and having given it a very great Heat, he fix’d it so to a Receiver, exhausted by the Air Pump, that all the Air rushing in to fill the Receiver, should first pass thro’ a Hole in the hot Iron. He then put a small Bird into the Receiver, who breath’d that Air without any Inconvenience or suffering the least Disorder. But the same Experiment being made with a Cube of hot Brass, a Bird put into that Air dy’d in a few Minutes. Brass indeed stinks even when cold, and much more when hot; Lead too, when hot, yields a very unwholesome Steam; but Iron is always sweet, and every way taken is wholesome and friendly to the human Body——except in Weapons.  
That warm Rooms make People tender and apt to catch Cold, is a Mistake as great as it is (among the English) general. We have seen in the preceding Pages how the common Rooms are apt to give Colds; but the Writer of this Paper may affirm, from his own Experience, and that of his Family and Friends who have used warm Rooms for these four Winters past, that by the Use of such Rooms, People are rendered less liable to take Cold, and indeed actually hardened. If sitting warm in a Room made One subject to take Cold on going out, lying warm in Bed should, by a Parity of Reason, produce the same Effect when we rise; Yet we find we can leap out of the warmest Bed naked in the coldest Morning, without any such Danger; and in the same Manner out of warm Clothes into a cold Bed. The Reason is, that in these Cases the Pores all close at once, the Cold is shut out, and the Heat within augmented, as we soon after feel by the glowing of the Flesh and Skin. Thus no one was ever known to catch Cold by the Use of the Cold Bath: And are not cold Baths allowed to harden the Bodies of those that use them? Are they not therefore frequently prescrib’d to the tenderest Constitutions? Now every Time you go out of a warm Room into the cold freezing Air, you do as it were plunge into a Cold Bath, and the Effect is in proportion the same; for (tho’ perhaps you may feel somewhat chilly at first) you find in a little Time your Bodies hardened and strengthened, your Blood is driven round with a brisker Circulation, and a comfortable steady uniform inward Warmth succeeds that equal outward Warmth you first received in the Room. Farther to confirm this Assertion, we instance the Swedes, the Danes, the Russians: These Nations are said to live in Rooms, compar’d to ours, as hot as Ovens;  
*Mr. Boyle, in his Experiments and Observations upon Cold, Page 684 of Shaw’s Abridgment, says, “’Tis remarkable, that while the Cold has strange and tragical Effects at Moscow, and elsewhere, the Russians and Livonians should be exempt from them, who accustom themselves to pass immediately from a great Degree of Heat, to as great an one of Cold, without receiving any visible Prejudice thereby. I remember, being told by a Person of unquestionable Credit, that it was a common Practice among them, to go from a hot Stove into cold Water; the same was, also, affirmed to me, by another who resided at Moscow: This Tradition is likewise abundantly confirmed by Olearius. ‘’Tis a surprizing thing,’ says he, ‘to see how far the Russians can endure Heat; and how, when it makes them ready to faint, they can go out of their Stoves, stark naked, both Men and Women, and throw themselves into cold Water; and even in Winter wallow in the Snow.’ ”  
yet where are the hardy Soldiers, tho’ bred in their boasted cool Houses, that can, like these People, bear the Fatigues of a Winter Campaign in so severe a Climate, march whole Days to the Neck in Snow, and at Night entrench in Ice, as they do?  
The Mentioning of those Northern Nations puts me in Mind of a considerable Publick Advantage that may arise from the general Use of these Fire-places. It is observable, that tho’ those Countries have been well inhabited for many Ages, Wood is still their Fuel, and yet at no very great Price; which could not have been if they had not universally used Stoves, but consum’d it as we do, in great Quantities by open Fires. By the Help of this saving Invention, our Wood may grow as fast as we consume it, and our Posterity may warm themselves at a moderate Rate, without being oblig’d to fetch their Fuel over the Atlantick; as, if Pit-Coal should not be here discovered (which is an Uncertainty) they must necessarily do.  
We leave it to the Political Arithmetician to compute, how much Money will be sav’d to a Country, by its spending two thirds less of Fuel; how much Labour sav’d in Cutting and Carriage of it; how much more Land may be clear’d for Cultivation; how great the Profit by the additional Quantity of Work done, in those Trades particularly that do not exercise the Body so much, but that the Workfolks are oblig’d to run frequently to the Fire to warm themselves: And to Physicians to say, how much healthier thick-built Towns and Cities will be, now half suffocated with sulphury Smoke, when so much less of that Smoke shall be made, and the Air breath’d by the Inhabitants be consequently so much purer.

An account of the new-invented Pennsylvanian F1rk-PLACES:  
Wherein their construction and manner of operation is par-  
ticularly explained ; their advantages above every other me-  
thod of warming rooms demonstrated ; and all objections that  
have been raised against the use of them,answeredandobviated.  
With directions for putting them up, and for using them to  
the bestadvantage. By 8B. F. first printed at Philad. in 1745.  
  
  
  
AS so much of the comfort and conveniency of our lives, foy  
go great a part of the year, depends on the article of fire ; since  
fuel is become so expensive, and (as the country is more cleared  
and settled) will of course grow scarcer and dearer, any new  
proposal for saving the wood, and for lessening the charge, and  
augmenting the benefit of fire. by some particular method of  
making and managing it, may at least be thought worth con-  
sideration.  
  
The new Fire-PLAcks are alate invention to that purpose,  
of which this paper is intended to give a particular account.  
  
That the reader may the better judge whether this method of  
managing fire has any advantage over those heretofore in use, it  
may be proper to consider both the old and new methods sepe-  
rately and particularly, and afterwards make the comparison.

A fire being made in any chimney, the air over the fire is rari-  
tied by the heat, becomes lighter, and therefore immediately ris-  
es in the funnel, and goes out; the other air in the room (flow-  
ing towards the chimney) supplies its place, is rarified in its turn,  
and rises likewise ; the place of the air thus carried out of the  
room, is supplied by fresh air coming in through the doors and  
windows, or, if they be shut, through every crevice with violence,  
as may be seen by holding a candle to a key-hole: if the room  
de so tight ‘as that all the crevices together will not supply so  
much air as is continually carried off, then, in a little time, the  
current up the funnel must flag, and being no longer driven up,  
the smoke must come into the room.  
  
1. Fire, (2. e. common fire) throws out light, heat, and smoke  
(or fume.) The two first move in right lines, and with great  
swiftness, the latter is but just seperated from the fuel, and then  
moves only as it is carried by the stream of rarified air : and with-  
out a continual accession and recession ef air, to carry off the  
smoaky fumes, they would remain crouded about the fire, and sti-  
fle it.  
  
2. Heat may be seperated from the smoke as well as from the  
light, by means of a plate of iron, which will suffer heat to pass  
through it without the others,

3. Fire sends out its rays of heat, as well as rays of light,  
equally every way ; but the greatest sensible heat is over the fire,  
where there is, besides the rays of heat shot upwards, a continu.  
al rising stream of hot airy heated by the rays shot round on  
every side.  
  
These things being understood, we proceed to consider the Fire-  
places heretofore in use, viz.  
  
1. The large open fire-places used in the days of our fathers,  
and still generally in the country, and in kitchens.  
  
2, The newer-fashioned fire-places, with low breasts and nar-  
tow hearths.  
  
3. Fire-plaees with hollow backs, hearths and jambs of iron,  
(described by M. Gauger in his tract entitled, La Mechanique  
de Feu) for warming the air as it comes into the room.  
  
4. The Holland stoves, with iron doors opening into the  
room. |  
  
5. The German stoves, which have no opening in the room  
where they are used, but the fire is put in from some other room,  
or from without. |  
  
1. The first of these methods has generally the conveniency  
of two warm seats, one in each corner; but they are some  
times too hot to abide in, and, at other times, incommoded with  
the smoke. Their inconveniencies are, that they almost always  
smcke, if the door be not left open ; which occasions what is  
ealled a strong draft to the chimney, without which strong draft,  
the smeke would come out of some part or other of so large an  
opening, so that the door can seldom be shut. A moderate  
guantity of wood on the fire, in so large a hearth, seems _ but lit-  
tle ; and, in so strong and cold a draught, warms but little : so  
that people are continually laying on more. [n short ’tis next  
to impossible to warm aroom with such fire-place : and I sup-  
pose our ancestors never thought of warming rooms to sit in ;  
all they purposed was, to have a place to make a fire in, by which  
they might warm themselves when cold.  
  
2. Most of these old-fashioned chimneys in towns and cities,  
have been, of late years, reduced to second sort mentioned, by  
building jambs within them,narrowing the hearth, and making 2  
low arch or breast. A od  
  
This improvement, however,by small openings and low breasts,  
has been made in our days ; and success in the first experiments  
has brought it into general use in cities, so that almost all new  
chimnies are now made of that sort, and much fewer bricks will  
make a stack of chimneys now than formerly. An improvement

go lately made, may give us room to believe, that still farther  
improvements may be found to remedy the inconveniencies yet  
remaining. For these new chimneys, though they keep rooms  
  
enerally free from smoke, and the opening being contracted,  
will allow the door to be shut, yet the funnel still requiring a  
considerable quantity of air, it rushes in at every crevice so  
strongly, as to make a continual whistling or howling, and it is  
very uncomfortable, as well as dangerons, to sit against such cree  
vice. Women, particularly, from this cause, as they sit much  
in the house, get colds in the head, rheums and defluctions, which  
fall into their jaws and gums, and have destroyed early many a  
fine set of teeth in these Northern colonies, Great and bright  
fires do also very much contribute to damage the eyes, dry and  
shrivel the skin, and bring on early the appearances of old age,  
In short, many of the diseases proceeding from colds, as fevers,  
pleurisies, &amp;c. fatal to very great numbers of people, may be as-  
cribed to strong drawing chimneys, whereby, in severe weather,  
a man is scorched before, while he is froze behind.

In both these sorts of fire-places, the greatest part of the heat  
from the fire is lost ; for as fire naturally darts heat every way,  
the back, the two jambs, and the hearth, drink up almost all  
that is given them, very little being reflected from bodies so  
dark, porous, and unpolished ; and the upright heat, which is by  
far the greatest, flies directly up the chimney. Thus five sixths  
at least of the heat (and consequently of the fewel) is wasted, and  
contributes nothing towards warming the room.  
  
3. To remedy this, the Sieur Gauger gives, in his book enti-  
tled, La Mechanique de Feu, published in 1709, seven different  
constructions of the third sort of chimneys mentioned above, in  
which there are hollow cavities made by iron plates in the back,  
jambs, and hearth, through which plates the heat passing, warms  
the air in those cavities, which is continually coming into the  
toom fresh and warm. The invention was very ingenious, and  
had many conveniencies. But the first expence, which was  
very great ; the intricacy of the design, andthe difficulty of the  
execution, especially in old chimnies, discouraged the propagation  
of the invention ; so that there are, I suppose, very few such  
chimnies now in use, [The upright heat, too, was almost all  
lost in these, as in the common chimneys. ]  
  
4. The Holland iron stove, which has a flue proceeding from  
the top, and a small iron door opening into the room, comes next  
to be considerd. Its conveniencies are, that it makes a room all  
over warm ; for the chimney being wholly closed, except the  
flue of the stove, very little air is required te supply that, and

oe tot much rushes in at crevices, or at the door when }}  
  
s opened. Little -fewel serves, the heat being almost all saved :  
for it rays out almost equally from the four sides, the bottom  
and the top, into the room, and presently warms the air around  
  
it, which being rarified, rises to the cieling, and its place is sup.  
  
plied by the lower air of the room, winch flow’ gradually to.  
wards the stove, and is there warmed, and rises in its turn, so  
that there is a continual circulation till all the air in the room js  
warmed. The air, too, is gradually changed, by the stove-door’s  
being in the room, through which part of it is continually pass.  
ing, and that makes these stoves wholsomer, or at least pleas.  
anter than the German stoves, next to be spoken of.—But they  
have these inconveniencies. There is no sight of the fire, which  
is in itself a pleasant thing. One eannot conveniently make  
any other use of the fire but that of warming the room. When  
the room is warm, people not seeing the fire, are apt to forget  
supplying it with fuel till it is almost out, then growing cold, a  
great deal of wood is put in, which soon makesit too hot. The  
change of air is not carried on quite quick enough, so that if any  
smoke or ill smell happens in the room, it is a long time before it is  
discharged. For these reasons the Holland stove has not obtained  
much among the English (who love the sight of the fire) unless  
in some workshops, where people are obliged to sit near the  
windows for the light, and in such places they have been found  
of good use.  
  
5. The German stove is like a box, one side wanting. It is  
composed of five iron plates screwed together, and fixed so as that  
you may put the fuel into it from another room, or from the out-  
side of the houss. It is a kind of oven reversed, its mouth being  
without, and body within the rocm that is to be warmed by it.  
This invention certainly warms a room very speedily and tho-  
roughly with &#x27;ittle fuel : No quantity of cold air comes in at any  
Crevice, because there ts no discharge of air which it might supply,  
there being no passage into the stove from the room. These  
are its convenieucies.—Its inconveniencies are, that people have  
Hot even so much sight or use of the fire as in the Holland stoves,  
und are, moreover, obliged to breathe the same unchanged air  
coutinually, mixed with the breath and perspiration from one  
another’s bodies, which is very disagreeable to those who have  
not been accustomed to it.  
  
To avoid the several inconveniencies, and at the same time  
to retain all the advautages of other fire-slaces, was contrived  
the PENNSYLVANIA FIRE-PLACK. |

To put this machine to work,  
  
1. A false back of four inch (or, in shallow small chimneys,  
two inch) brick work isto be made in the chimney, four inches  
or more from the true back ; in some shallow chimneys, to make  
more room for the false back and its flue, four inches of the  
chimney back may be picked away : From the top of this false  
back a closing is to be made over to the breast of the chimney,  
that no air may pass into the chimney, but what goes under  
the false back, and up behind it ; always observing, if there is  
a wooden mantletree to close above it.  
  
2. Some bricks of the hearth are to be taken up, to form  
a hollow under the bottom plate, which must be tiled over se-  
curely ; across which hollow runsa thin tight partition, to keep  
apart the air entering the hollow and the smoke ; and is there~  
fore placed between the air-hole and smoke-holes.  
  
8. A passage is made, communicating with the outward air,  
to introduce that air into the fore part of the hollow under the  
bottom plate, whence it may rise through the air-hole into the  
  
21 air-box.  
  
4. A passage is made from the back part of the hollow, com-  
municating with the flue behind the false back : gh this  
passage the smoke is to pass.

the passage that leads it under and behind the false back, and so  
rises into the chimney.  
  
At the same time the air, warmed under the bottom-plate, |  
and inthe air-box, rises and comes out of the holes in the side-  
plates, very swiftly if the door of the room be shut, and joins its  
current with the stream, rising from the side, back, and top  
plates.  
  
The air that enters the room through the air-box is fresh,  
though warm; and, computing the swiftness of its motion with  
the areas of the holes, it is found that near ten barrels of fresh  
air are hourly introduced by the air-box ; and by this means the  
air in the room is continually changed, and kept, at the same  
time, sweet and warm.

Your cord-wood must be cut into three lengths, hickory, ash,  
or any dry wood that burns with a clear flame, are rather to be  
chosen, as such are less apt to foul the smoke-passages with soot;  
and flame communicates, with its light, as well as by contact,  
greater heat to the plates and room. But where more ordinary  
wood is used, half a dry faggot of brush-wood, burnt at the first  
making of fire in the morning is very advantageous, as it imme-  
diately, by its sudden blaze, heats the plates, and warms the  
room(which with bad wood slowly kindling would not be done so  
soon) and at the same time, by the length of ‘¢s flame, turning in  
the passages, consumes and cleanses away the soot that such bad  
smoky wood had produced therein the preceding d2y, and so  
keeps them always free and clean.—When you have laid a little  
back log, and placed your billets on small dogs, as in common  
chimneys, and put some fire to them, then slide down your shut-  
ter aslow as the dogs, or if moveable set it on the dogs or  
handirons, and the opening being by that means contracted, the  
air rushes in briskly, and presently blows up the flames.  
  
At night when you goto bed, cover the coals or brands with  
ashes as usual ; then take away the dogs, and slide down the shut-  
ter close to the bottom-plate, sweeping a little ashes against it,  
that no air may pass under it ; then turn the register, so as very  
near to stop the flue behind. If nosmoke then comes out at  
crevices intg the room, it is right: If any smoke is perceived  
to come out, move the register so as to give a little draught, and  
it will go the right way.—Thus the room will be kept warm  
allnight ; for the chimney being almost entirely stopt, very lit-  
tle cold air, if any, will enter the room at any crevice. When  
youcome to rekindle the fire in the morning, turn open the reg-  
ister before you liftup the slider, otherwise,if there be any smoke  
in the fire-place, it will come out into the room. The reg-  
ister has also other uses. If you observe the draught of air in-  
to your fire-place to be stronger than is necessary, (as in extreme  
cold weather it often is) so that the wood is consumed faster than  
usual; in that case, a quarter, half, or two thirds turn of the

register, wall check the violence of the draught, and let your  
fire burn with the moderation you desire: And at the same  
time both the fire-place and the room will be the warmer, be-  
cause less cold air will enter and pass through them.—And if  
the chimney should happpen to take fire, a turn of the register  
shuts all close, and prevents any air going into the chimney,  
and so the fire may easily be stifled and mastered.  
  
The advantages of this Firt-Piace are,  
  
That your whole room is equally warmed, so that people  
need not crowd so close round the fire, but may sit near the  
window, and have the benefit of the light for reading, writing,  
and needle-work.  
  
If you sit against a crevice, there is not that sharp draught of  
cold air playing on you as in rooms where there are fires in  
the common way; by which many catch cold, whence pro-  
ceed coughs *, catarrhs, tooth-achs, fevers, pleurisies, and ma-  
ny other diseases.  
  
In case of sickness they make most excellent nursing rooms ;  
as they constantly supply a sufficiency of fresh air, so warmed  
at the same time as to be no way inconvenient or dangerous.  
A small one does wellin a chamber ; and, the chimneys being  
fitted for it, it may be removed from one room to another, as  
occasion requires, and fixed in half an hour. The equal tem-  
per, too, and warmth, of the air of the room, is thought to be  
particularly advantageous in some distempers.  
  
In common chimneys, the strongest heat from the fire, which  
is upwards, goes directly up the chimney, and is lost; and  
there is such a strong draught into the chimney, that not only  
the upright heat, but also the back, sides, and downward heats,  
are carried up the chimney by that draught of air; and the  
warmth given before the fire by the rays that strike out towards  
the room, is continually driven back, crowded into the chimney,  
and carried up by the same draught of air.

102 ON FIRE PLACES  
  
When you burn candles near this fire-place, you will find  
that the flame burns quite upright, and does not blare and run  
the tallow down, by drawing towards the chimney, as against  
common fires.  
  
This fire-place cures most smokey chimneys, and thereby  
preserves both the eyes and furniture.  
  
It prevents the fouling of chimneys ; much of the lint and  
dust that contributes to foul a chimney being, by the low arch,  
obliged to pass through the flame, where itisconsumed. Then,  
less wood being burnt, there is less smoke made. Again, the  
shutter, or trap-bellows, soon blowing the wood into a flame,  
the same wood does not yield so much smoke as if burnt in a  
common chimney : For as soon as flame begins, smoke, in pro-  
portion, ceases.  
  
And if achimney should be foul, it is much less likely to take  
fire. If it should take fire, it is easily stifled and extinguished.  
  
A fire may be very speedily made in this fire-place, by the  
help of the shutter, or trap-bellows, as aforesaid.  
  
A fire may be soon extinguished, by. closing it with the shut-  
ter before, and turning the register behind, which will stifle it,  
and the brands will remain ready to rekindle.  
  
The room being once warm, the warmth may be retained in  
it all night.  
  
And, lastly, the fire is so secured at night, that not one  
spark can fly out into the room to do damage.  
  
With all these conveniencies, you do not lose the pleasant  
sight nor use of the fire. |  
  
We frequently hear it said, They are of the nature of Dutch stoves ;  
stoves have an unpleasant smell; stoves are unwholesome ; and,  
warm rooms make people tender, and apt to catch cold.—As to the  
first, that they are of the nature of Dutch stoves, the description  
ef those stoves, in the beginning of this paper, compared with  
that of these machines, shows that there is a most material dif-  
ference, and that these have vastly the advantage, if it were on-  
  
ly inthe single article of the admission and circulation of the  
fresh air. But it must be allowed there may have been some  
cause to complain of the offensive smell of iron stoves. ‘This  
smell, however, never proceeded from the iron itself, which, in  
its nature, whether hot or cold, is one of the sweetest of metals,  
but from the general uncleanly manner of using those stoves ;  
but nothing is more easy than to keep them clean ; for when  
  
wood, at least, is saved. My common room, I know,is made twice as warm as  
it used to be, with aquarter of the wood I formerly consumed there.

by any accident they happen to be fouled, a lee made of ashes  
and water, with a brush, wiil scour them perfectly ; as will also  
a little strong soft soap and water.  
  
That warm rooms make people tender, and apt to catch cold, is a  
mistake as great as it is (amongthe English) general. We have  
seen in the preceding pages how the common rooms are apt  
to give colds ; but the writer of this paper may affirm from his  
own experience, and that of his family and friends who have  
used warm rooms for these four winters past, that by the use  
of such rooms, people are rendered /ess liable to take cold, and,  
indeed, actually hardened. If sitting warm in a room made one  
subject to take cold on going out, lying warm in bed should,  
by a parity of reason, produce the same effect when we rise.  
Yet we find we can leap out of the warmest bed naked, in the  
coldest morning, without any such danger; and in the same  
manner out of warm clothes into a cold bed. Farther to con-  
firm this assertion, we instance the Sqweedes, the Danes, and the  
Russians : These nations are said to live in rooms, compared to  
ours, as hot as ovens *; yet where are the hardy soldiers, that  
can, like these people, bear the fatigues of a winter campaign  
in so severe a climate, march whole days to the neck in snow,  
and at night entrench in ice, as they do ?  
  
It is observable, that though those countries have been well  
inhabited for many ages, wood is still their fuel, and yet at no  
very great price ; which could not have been, ifthey had not  
universally used stoves, but consumed it as we do, in great quan-  
tities, by open fires. By the help of this saving invention our  
wood may grow as fast as we consume it, and our posterity may  
warm themselves at a moderate rate.

* Mr. Boyle, in his experiments and observations upon cold, Shaw&#x27;s Abridge-  
ment, Vol. 1. p.684, says, “ &quot;Tis remarkable, that while the cold has strange and  
tragical effects at Moscow, and elsewhere, the Russians and Livonian; should ie ex-  
empt from them, who accustom themselves to pass immediately from a great  
degree of heat,to as great an one of cold, without receiving any visible pre-  
judice thereby. I remember being told by a person of unquestionable credit,  
that it was a common practice among them, to go from a_ hot stove, into cold  
water; the same was also affirmed tome by another who resided at Moscow.  
This tradition is likewise abundantly confirmed by Olcarius. “Lis a surprizing  
thing, says he, to see how far the Russians can endure beat; and how, when it makes  
them ready to faint, they can go out of their stoves, stark naked, both men and women, and  
throw themselves into cold water ; and even in winter cvallow in the snow.”

For family and office stoves, and for nearly all kinds of  
ranges, heaters, and furnaces of the present improved con-  
struction, the world is indebted almost exclusively to Ameri-  
can inventive genius and mechanical skill. German and  
Dutch stoves of rude contrivance were first used, and Ben-  
jamin Franklin made an improvement on these in what he  
styled his ‘‘ Pennsylvania fireplace.” One of his arguments  
for them, as given in his quaint language, was: ‘‘1f you sit  
near the fire, you have not that cold draught of uncemfort-  
able air nipping your back and heels, as when before com-  
mon fires, by which many catch cold, being scorched before,
