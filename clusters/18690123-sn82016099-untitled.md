The following florid item is going the rounds of the Eastern press:  
  
At one time a woman could hardly walk through the streets of San Francisco without having every one pause to gaze at her, and a child was so rare, that once in a theatre, in the same city, when a woman had taken her infant, when it began to cry, just as the orchestra began to play, a man in the pit cried out: &quot;Stop those fiddles and let the baby cry. I haven&#x27;t heard such a sound for ten years.&quot; The audience applauded this sentiment, the orchestra stopped, and the baby continued its performance, amid unbounded enthusiasm.

Why Women are Precious  
It has long been known that “Dis­  
tance lends enchantment to the view’  
and on this ground alone some writers  
have sensibly advised women who wish  
to he highly valued to “make themselves  
scarce”  
But the effect of literal scarcity on  
this article has been first elaborated in  
the Westminster Review for Octob&amp;iy  
which shows that women have more  
influence and a higher standing in pro­  
portion as men exceed them in number  
It gives the following singular illustra­  
tion if it may he called such :  
“At one time a woman could hardly  
walk through the streets of San Fran­  
cisco without having every one pause  
to gaze on her and a child was so rare  
that once at a theatre in the same city  
where a woman had taken her infant  
when it began to cry just as the orches­

There was a time when women and children were  
scarce in San Francisco. They were then appreciated.  
According to the Westminster Review, a woman ouce  
took her infant to a theatre in San Francisco, and just  
as the orchestra began to play the child began to wry.  
A man in the pit cried out, “Stop those fiddles and  
let the baby cry. I haven&#x27;t heard ench a sound for  
ten years!&quot; The audience applauded this sentiment ;  
the orchestra stopped, and the baby continued its per-

War Women are Parsciovs.—It has long  
been known that ‘‘distance lends enchantment to  
the view,” and on this ground alone some writers  
have advised women who wish to be  
valued to ‘‘make themeelves scarce.’ But  
the effect of literal scarcity on thie article has  
been @re¢ elaborated in the Westminster Review  
for October, which shows that women have wore  
  
influence and higher standing in proportion as  
men exceed them in number. It gives the fol-  
lowing singular illustration if it may be called  
such :—‘‘At one time a woman could hardly walk  
through the streets of San Francisco without  
having every one pause to gaze on her; and a  
child was so rare that once at a theater in the

anecdote concerning the early history of San  
Francisco: &quot;At one time a lady could hard­

without having every one to pause and gaze  
on her, and a child was so rare that once at a  
theatre in the same city, where a woman had
