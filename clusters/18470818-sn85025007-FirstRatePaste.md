FIRST RATE PASTE.  
  
Next to scissors, paste is an invaluable editorial assistant. As we prefer, says the North American, the first sharp and the latter sweet and pure, we look upon some scientific philanthropist who promulgates a new recipe for paste, as a Godfrey, a Franklin, a Fulton, a Davy, or a Morse. &quot;You all do know,&quot; as Mark Antony said, that when paste is made in the ordinary manner it soon becomes mouldy, and by fermenting in warm weather, it loses its sticking power. To make some to keep, dissolve an ounce of alum in a quart of warm water; when cold add as much flour as will make it the consistency of cream; then strew it in as much powdered rosin as will stand on a shilling, and two or three cloves; boil it down to a consistence, stirring all the time. It will keep for twelve months, and when dry may be softened with water.  
  
Think of this, ye who have a paste pot under your nose from one year&#x27;s end to the other; think of the flavor of cloves perfuming your room, instead of the villianous odors from the fermented rye flour and water.
