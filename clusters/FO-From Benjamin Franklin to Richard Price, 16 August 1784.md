. When I think of your present crazy Constitution, &amp; its Diseases, I imagine the enormous Emoluments of Place to be among the greatest, and while they exist I doubt whether even the Reform of your Representation will cure the Evils constantly arising from your perpetual Factions. As it seems to be a settled Point at present that the Minister must govern the Parliament, who are to do everything he would have done, and he is to bribe them to do this, and the People are to furnish the Money to pay these Bribes, such a Parliament appears to me a very expensive Machine for Government, and I apprehend the People will find out in time that they may as well be governed, and that it will be  
  
much cheaper to be governed, by the Minister alone, no Parliament being preferable to the present.
