In Consequence of these Disorders, and Petitions from the People, the Proprietors were oblig’d to surrender that Government to the Crown; Queen Anne then reigning; who of all our Crowned Heads since the Revolution, was by far the least favourable to Dissenters; yet her Instructions to Lord Cornbury, her first Governor, were express and full in their Favour, viz. Instr. 51.”You are to permit a Liberty of Conscience to all Persons, (except Papists) so that they may be contented with a quiet and peaceable Enjoyment of the same, not giving Offence or Scandal to the Government.”  
Instr. 52. “And whereas we have been informed that divers of our good Subjects inhabiting those Parts, do make a religious Scruple of Swearing, and by reason of their refusing to take an Oath in any Court of Justice and other Places, are or may be liable to many Inconveniencies, our Will and Pleasure is, that in Order to their Ease in what they conceive to be Matter of Conscience, so far as may be consistent with good Order and Government, you take Care that an Act be passed in the General Assembly of our said Province, to the like Effect as that passed here in the Seventh and Eighth Years of his late Majesty’s Reign, entitled, An Act that the solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People called Quakers, shall be accepted instead of an Oath in the usual Form; and that the same be transmitted to us, and to our Commissioners for Trade and Plantations, as before directed.”

tituled, ““An Act that the Solemnization, Affirmation, and Declaration of the  
People called Quakers, shall be received instead of an Oath in the usual Form,”  
reciting that divers dissenters, commonly called Quakers, refusing to take an  
oath in courts of justice and other places, are frequently imprisoned and their  
estates sequestered by process of contempt issuing out of such courts, to the  
ruin of themselves and families, it is enacted, that every Quaker, on every  
occasion (except on criminal trials), where an oath is by law required, shall  
be permitted to make solemn affirmation and declaration in lieu thereof; and  
whereas the same privilege has by subsequent acts of parliament been ex-  
tended in all cases to the persons called Quakers and Moravians, and has been  
granted to other persons under the denomination of Separatists, and has been  
found highly useful to the public interest; but many persons who fall under  
none of these denominations sincerely believe that they cannot lawfully take  
an oath, and are thereby placed in a great measure out of the protection of  
the law, and are liable to punishment for suppressing the truth, when they

when it became certain the separation of the Colonies from

measures with a view to secure their religion as the establish-

any kind was utterly impossible. At the period of the Revo-
