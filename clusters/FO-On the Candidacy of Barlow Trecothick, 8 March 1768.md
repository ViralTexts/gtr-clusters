g ourselves. Charity, your own proverb says, begins at home. Why should you expect us to have more concern for your poor than you have? If you want our help in maintaining them as heretofore, you know how it may be easily had. The means are in your own hands; you know you got all from us, by trade, that we could possibly spare, and kept us besides continually in your debt; what would you, what can you have more? The situation of the colonies seems similar to that of the cows in the fable; forbidden to suckle their own calves, and daily drawn dry, yet they parted with their milk willingly; but when moreover a tax came to be demanded of them, and that too to be paid in grass of which they had already too short a provision; it was no wonder they thought their masters unreasonable, and resolved for the future to suck one another.  
Boston man as I am, Sir, and inimical, as my country is represented to be, I hate neither England nor Englishmen, driven (though my ancestors were) by mistaken oppression of former times, out of this happy country, to suffer all the hardships of an American wilderness. I retain no resentment on that account. I wish prosperity to the nation; I honour, esteem, and love its people. I only hate calumniators and boutefeus on either side the water, who would for the little dirty purposes of faction, set brother against brother, turn friends into mortal enemies, and ruin an empire by dividing it.

To OLD ENGLAND.  
HARITY (your own proverb  
} Mays) begins at home. hy  
fhould you expect us to have more  
concern for your poor than you have?  
If you want our help in maintaining  
them, as heretofore, you know how  
it may be had. The means are in  
your hands. You know yougot al!  
from us, by trade, that we could  
poflibly {pare, and kept us, befides,  
continually in your debt. What  
would you, what can you have moré ?  
The prefent fituation of the colo-  
nies feems fimilar to that of the cows  
in the fable. Forbidden to fuckle  
their own calves, and daily drawn  
dry, they yet parted with their milk  
willingly ; but when moreover a tax  
came to be demanded of them (and  
that too to be paid in grafs, of which  
they had already too thort a provifion)  
it was no wonder they thought their  
matters unreafonable, and refolved,  
for the future, to fuck one anotiter.  
I kate’ neither England nor Eng-  
lifhmen. Though my anceftors were  
driven (by miftaken oppreffion of  
former times) out of this happy  
country,and fuffered all the hardthips  
of an American wildernefs, I retmn  
no refentment on that account. I

nour, efteem, and love its people.  
Tonly hate calumniators on either

Jittle dirty purpofes of faction) fet  
brother againft brother, turn friends  
into enemies, and ruin an empire, by
