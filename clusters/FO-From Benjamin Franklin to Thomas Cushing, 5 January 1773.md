e some Circumstances are working in our favour with regard to the Duties. It is found by the last Years Accounts transmitted by the Commissioners, that the Ballance in favour of Britain is but about £85 after Payment of Salaries, &amp;c. exclusive of the Charge of a Fleet to enforce the Collection. Then it is observ’d that the India Company is so out of Cash, that it cannot pay the Bills drawn upon it, and its other Debts; and at the same time so out of Credit, that the Bank does not care to assist them, whence they find themselves obliged to lower their Dividend; the Apprehension of which has sunk their Stock from 280 to 160, whereby several Millions of Propery are annihilated, occasioning private Bankrupcies and other Distress, besides a Loss to the Publick Treasury of £400,000 per Annum which the Company by Agreement are not to pay into it as heretofore, if they are not able to keep up their Dividend at 12½. And as they have at the same time Tea and other India Goods in their Warehouses to the Amount of Four Millions as some say, for which they want a Market, and which if it had been sold would have kept up their Credit, I take the Opportunity of remarking in all Companies, the great Imprudence of losing the American Market, by keeping up the Duty on Tea, which has thrown that Trade into the Hands of the Dutch, Danes, Swedes and French, who (according to the Reports and Letters of some Custom-House Officers in America) now supply by Smuggling the whole Continent, not with Tea only, but accompany that Article with other India Goods, amounting as suppos’d in the whole to £500,000 Sterling per Annum. This gives some Alarm, and begins to convince People more and more, of the Impropriety of Quarrelling with the American

But our great Security lies, I think, in our growing Strength both in Wealth and Numbers, that creates an increasing Ability of Assisting this Nation in its Wars, which will make us more respectable, our Friendship more valued, and our Enmity feared; thence it will soon be thought proper to treat us, not with Justice only, but with Kindness; and thence we may expect in a few Years a total Change of Measures with regard to us; unless by a Neglect of military Discipline we should lose all our martial Spirit, and our western People become as tame as those in the eastern Dominions of Britain, when we may expect the same Oppressions: For there is much Truth in the Italian Saying, Make yourselves Sheep and the Wolves will eat you. In confidence of this coming Change in our favour, I think our Prudence is mean while to be quiet, only holding up our Rights and Claims on all Occasions, in Resolutions, Memorials, and Remonstrances, but bearing patiently the little present Notice that is taken of them.

“ Some circumstances are working in  
favour of America, with regard to the du­  
ties ; it is found by the last year’s account  
transmitted by the Commiflioners that the  
balance in favour of Britain is but about  
eighty-five pounds, after payment of fal*-  
ries, kc. exclusive of the charge of a fleet  
to enforce the colleftion.—lt is further ob­  
served, that the India Company is so out  
of Cath that it cannot pay the bills drawn  
upon it, and at the fame time so out of cre­  
dit that the bank does not care to aflift  
them; whence they find themselves obliged  
to lower their dividend, the apprehension of  
which has funk their stock from 280 to i6o»  
whereby several millions of property are an­  
nihilated, occasioning private bankruptcies  
and other diftrefe, besides a loss to the pub­  
lic treasury of 4. 400,0e0 per ann. which  
the company by agreement are not to pay  
into it as heretofore, if they are not able to  
keep up their dividend at and as they  
have at the fame time tea and other India  
goods in their warehouses, to the amount  
of four millions as some fay, for which they  
want a market, and which if it had been  
fold, would have kept up their credit. This  
(hews the great importance of losing the A­  
merican market, by keeping up the duties  
on tea, which has thrown the trade into the  
hands of foreigners. This gives some alarm  
and begins to convince people more and  
more of the impropriety of quarrelling with  
the Americans.
