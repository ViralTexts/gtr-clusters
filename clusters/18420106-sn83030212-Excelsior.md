The shades of night were falling fast,  
As through an Alpine village passed  
A youth who bore, &#x27;mid snow and ice,  
A banner with the strange device.  
Excelsior!  
  
His brow was sad, his eye beneath,  
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath;  
And like a silver clarion rung  
The accents of that unknown tongue,  
Excelsior!  
  
In happy homes he saw the light  
Of household fires gleam warm and bright  
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,  
And from his lips escaped a groan,  
Excelsior!  
  
&quot;Try not the Pass!&quot; the old man said;  
&quot;Dark lowers the tempest overhead,  
The roaring torrent is deep and wide!&quot;  
And loud that clarion voice replied  
Excelsior!  
  
&quot;Oh stay,&quot; the maiden said, &quot;and rest  
Thy weary head upon this breast!&quot;  
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,  
But still he answered, with a sigh,  
Excelsior!  
  
&quot;Beware the pine tree&#x27;s withered branch!  
Beware the awful avalanche!&quot;  
This was the peasant&#x27;s last good night,  
A voice replied, far up the hight,  
Excelsior!  
  
At break of day, as heavenward  
The pious monks of Saint Bernard  
Uttered the oft repeated prayer,  
A voice cried through the startled air  
Excelsior!  
  
A traveler, by the faithful hound,  
Half buried in the snow was found,  
Still grasping in his hand of ice  
That banner with the strange device  
Excelsior!  
  
There in the twilight cold and gray,  
Lifeless but beautiful, he lay,  
And from the sky, serene and far,  
A voice fell, like a falling star!  
Excelsior!

Tue shades of night were falling fast,  
  
As through an Alpine village passed  
  
A youth, who bore, ’mid snow and ice,  
  
A banner with the strange device,  
Excelsior !  
  
His brow was sad; his eye beneath  
  
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath,  
  
And like a silver clarion rung  
  
The accents of that unknown tongue,  
Excelsior !  
  
In happy homes he saw the light

Above, the spectral glaciers shone,  
And from his lips escaped a groan,  
Excelsior!  
  
**Try not the pass!” the old man said;  
  
**Dark lowers the tempest overhead,  
  
The roaring torrent is deep and wide!”  
  
An1 loud that clarion voice replied,  
Excelsior!  
  
**O, stay,” the maiden said, ‘‘and rest  
  
Thy weary head upon this breast!”  
  
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,  
  
But still he answered, with a sigh,  
Excelsior!  
  
‘‘ Beware the pine-tree’s withered branch  
  
Beware the awful avalanche !”  
  
This was the peasant’s last good-night ;  
  
A voice replied, far up the height,  
Excelsior !  
  
At break of day, as heavenward  
  
The pious monks of Saint Bernard  
  
Uttered the oft-repeated prayer,  
  
A voice cried through the startled air,  
Excelsior!  
  
A traveler, by the faithful hound,  
Half-buried in the snow was found,  
Still grasping in his hand of ice  
That banner with the strange device.  
Excelsior!  
  
There, in the twilight cold and gray,  
  
Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay,  
  
And from the sky, serene and far,
