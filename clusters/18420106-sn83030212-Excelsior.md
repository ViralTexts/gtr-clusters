The shades of night were falling fast,  
As through an Alpine village passed  
A youth who bore, &#x27;mid snow and ice,  
A banner with the strange device.  
Excelsior!  
  
His brow was sad, his eye beneath,  
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath;  
And like a silver clarion rung  
The accents of that unknown tongue,  
Excelsior!  
  
In happy homes he saw the light  
Of household fires gleam warm and bright  
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,  
And from his lips escaped a groan,  
Excelsior!  
  
&quot;Try not the Pass!&quot; the old man said;  
&quot;Dark lowers the tempest overhead,  
The roaring torrent is deep and wide!&quot;  
And loud that clarion voice replied  
Excelsior!  
  
&quot;Oh stay,&quot; the maiden said, &quot;and rest  
Thy weary head upon this breast!&quot;  
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,  
But still he answered, with a sigh,  
Excelsior!  
  
&quot;Beware the pine tree&#x27;s withered branch!  
Beware the awful avalanche!&quot;  
This was the peasant&#x27;s last good night,  
A voice replied, far up the hight,  
Excelsior!  
  
At break of day, as heavenward  
The pious monks of Saint Bernard  
Uttered the oft repeated prayer,  
A voice cried through the startled air  
Excelsior!  
  
A traveler, by the faithful hound,  
Half buried in the snow was found,  
Still grasping in his hand of ice  
That banner with the strange device  
Excelsior!  
  
There in the twilight cold and gray,  
Lifeless but beautiful, he lay,  
And from the sky, serene and far,  
A voice fell, like a falling star!  
Excelsior!

His  
scheme was bold, though passing queer—  
Of wealth and brains the land to clear :  
So, setting class with class at war, He  
shouted o&#x27;er the land afar, &quot;Excelsior!&quot;  
From happy homes, our modern sage The  
Civil Servants grey with age Turned fast  
adrift with heart of stone, Reckless of  
wife or children&#x27;s groan— &quot; Excelsior!&quot;  
&quot; Oh tax us not!&quot; the squatters said,  
&quot;Or capital will soon have fled— Ruined  
the country far and wide !&quot;•— But loud  
that patriot voice replied, &quot; Excelsior  
!&quot; &quot; Leave us,&quot;&#x27; the Council said, &quot; and  
rest Content with feathering thy nest;&quot;  
Winking upon his followers nigh, Aloud  
he answered with a sigh, &quot;Excelsior!&quot; &quot;  
Beware the monetary crash !. Beware the  
universal smash !&quot; This was each  
thoughtful man&#x27;s good night ! A voice  
replied, far up the height— &quot;  
Excelsior!&quot; When, in his budget, so  
profound, A sad deficiency was found, .  
&quot;Tax them !&#x27;&#x27; he cried with angry  
breath— &quot; Tax all their industries to  
death !&quot; • &quot; Excelsior&#x27;.&quot; Holding a  
caucus of his friends, He touched their  
fears, and gained his ends— Still  
grasping grimly, like a vice, That  
banner, with the grand device, &quot;  
Excelsior!&quot; The people turned him out at  
last, A patriot&#x27;s soul still holding  
fast-Though, from a lone back bench  
afar, The voice fell of a fallen star— &quot;  
Excelsior!

asy to judge from this near outline, that the aria  
must retard the action of a dramatic composition, just as dif-  
fusive dialogue foreign to the situation will retard the action  
of adrama. Take as an easy illustration any poem in the  
English language suitable for effective recitation. How ab-  
surd would be the effect if the first verse were repeated  
several times in the progress of the piece as is the case  
with the first section of an aria! Take for instance  
‘*Excelsior” and interpolate the first verse between all the  
other verses. Here is a section of the puem as it would read  
in aria form :  
  
Oh, stay, the maiden said, and rest  
Thy weary head upon this breast.

His brow wa3 sad; his eye below  
Would indicate that he was slow;  
While like a last year&#x27;s bird&#x27;s nest rung  
The accents of that unknown tongue:  
Manana.  
In many ways he knew that he  
Should hustle most prodigiously;  
And though perhaps he might have  
tried,  
He only didn&#x27;t, as he sighed:  
Manana.  
&quot;Go, get a move on,&quot; thousands said,  
&quot;At that gait you can&#x27;t get ahead;  
  
uive up your . ancient, moss-grown  
  
pride;  
And soft ihe Spanish voice replied:  
Manana.  
  
Oh, stay, the maiden said,: &quot;and rest  
  
Your weary head upon this breast,&quot;  
A tear stood in his dark brown eye,  
And still he answered with a sigh:  
.. Manana.  
  
&quot;Say, -what&#x27;c the matter? Don&#x27;t you  
  
know &#x27;  
You haven&#x27;t get a bit of show  
  
That any pow:;r will itake your side?&#x27;  
A voice, half tears, half trick, replied  
  
Manana.  
At break of da; the Yankees held  
  
Tho Spaniard by the neck and yelled,  
  
Give up the stuf&quot; their daily prayer;  
  
A voice cried through the stratled air:  
  
Manana.  
A Spaniard in the snow &quot;was found  
ay persons who were nosing &#x27;round,  
Still grasping in his hand of ice  
  
That banner with the strange device:  
  
- - &#x27; Manana.  
There in the fvilight&#x27;cold and gray,  
Lifeless, but Spanish still, he lay,  
And from the sky, serene and far,  
A voice fell like a falling star
