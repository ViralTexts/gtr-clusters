THE FARMER&#x27;S CREED.—One of our exchanges gives the following first rate advice, under the heading of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Creed:&quot;  
  
We believe in small farms and thorough cultivation. The soil loves to eat, as well as its owners, and ought therefore to be nurtured. We believe in large crops, which leave the land better than they found it, making both the farm and farmer rich at once. We believe in going to the bottom of things, and therefore in deep plowing, and enough of it—all the better if with a subsoil plow. We believe that the fertility of any soil is thee spirit of industry, enterprise, and intelligence—without this, lime and gypsum, bones and green manure, marl or plaster, will be of little use. We believe in a clean kitchen, a neat wife in it, a spinning piano, and clean cup-board, dairy, and conscience. We firmly disbelieve in farmers that will not improve; in farms that grown poor every year; in starved cattle; in farmers&#x27; boys turning into clerks and merchants; in farmers&#x27; daughters unwilling to work; and in all farmers who are ashamed of their vocation.

plants as soon as they com­  
mence to grow. There is a  
great saving of time and labor  
in hauling manure directly to  
the place where it is to be used,  
  
and by scattering it where it is  
wanted. The best farmers no  
longer suffer manure to accumu­  
late about their barns and  
  
stables. They haul it out dur­  
ing favorable weather in winter,  
using sleds for the purpose  
when the ground is covered  
with snow. There is no injury  
to grass fields by drawing sleds  
over them when the ground is  
frozen, and very large loads  
can be taken all such times.
