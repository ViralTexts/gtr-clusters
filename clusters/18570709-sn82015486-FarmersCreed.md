THE FARMER&#x27;S CREED.—One of our exchanges gives the following first rate advice, under the heading of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Creed:&quot;  
  
We believe in small farms and thorough cultivation. The soil loves to eat, as well as its owners, and ought therefore to be nurtured. We believe in large crops, which leave the land better than they found it, making both the farm and farmer rich at once. We believe in going to the bottom of things, and therefore in deep plowing, and enough of it—all the better if with a subsoil plow. We believe that the fertility of any soil is thee spirit of industry, enterprise, and intelligence—without this, lime and gypsum, bones and green manure, marl or plaster, will be of little use. We believe in a clean kitchen, a neat wife in it, a spinning piano, and clean cup-board, dairy, and conscience. We firmly disbelieve in farmers that will not improve; in farms that grown poor every year; in starved cattle; in farmers&#x27; boys turning into clerks and merchants; in farmers&#x27; daughters unwilling to work; and in all farmers who are ashamed of their vocation.

FARMER’S CREED.  
We believe in small farms and thor­  
ough cultivation.  
We believe that the soil loves to eat,  
as well as its owner, and ought, there­  
fore, to be manured,  
j Wc believe in large crops which  
leave the land better than they found  
it—making both the farmer and the  
‘ farm i ich at once.  
Wc believe in going to the bottom of  
things, and, therefore, in deep plough*  
&#x27;;ng and enough of it. All the better  
if with a subsoil plow.  
YVc believe that every farm should  
own a good farmer.  
We believe that the best fertilizer  
of any soil is a spirit of industry, cn­  
terprijc and intelligence—without this,  
lime nnd gypsum, hones and green ma­  
nure, marl and guano, will he of little  
use.  
We believe in good fences, good  
hams, good farm houses, good stock,  
good orchards, and children enough to  
gather the fruit.  
We believe in a clean kitchen, a  
neat wile in it, a spinning piano, a  
clean cupboard, a clean dairy, and a  
clean cotM&#x27; iencc.  
Wc disbelieve in farmers that will  
not improve—iu farms that grow poor-

er every year—starving cattle—farm­  
er’s boys turning into clerks and mer­  
chants—in farmcr’sdaughters unwilling  
to work and in all farmers ashamed of  
their vocation, or who drink whisky  
till honest men arc ashamed of them.  
Moreover we believe in taking a  
Newspaper—in paying for it,and read­  
ing it. Such hints as these arc worth  
at least a year’s pay.

city of Geneva, and had devoted his early  
years to the profession of arms. Since 1806  
he resided in this city, and during the war  
of 1814-15, served as a volunteer under Gen.  
Jackson. Shortly after his arrival here, he  
got into a difficulty about a game of billiards  
awhich resulted in a duel.  
e When he and hts opponent mof the lut  
before they had orossed swords, struck  
  
ahim a false blow on his foot, which for the  
time bemg disabled him. His second then  
took up the gauntlet on his behalf, and was  
a slain. Two years afterwards Gentin and  
his former adversary met as seconds at ane  
a other duel and after their principals had de  
cided their mattor of dispute, another meci  
ing was at once arranged between Gentin  
 and the opposing accond. This time the con  
test proceeded to a fatal issue, and Gentin

&#x27;s Cke^d.— We believe in  
small farms and thorough cultivation. We  
believe that soil love3 to fat, awell as  
its owner, and ought therefore, to b  
manured. We believe in large crops which  
leave the land better than they found r,  
making both the farmer and the farm rich  
at once. We believe in going to the  
bottom of things and therefore in deep  
ploughing, and enough of it. We believe  
that every farm should own a good f  
jrni^r. We believe that the beat  
fertilise of any soil is a spirit of  
industry, enterprise, and intelligence,  
without this, lime and gypsum, bones and  
green manure, marl and guano will be of  
lit&#x27;lo use. We believe in good fences,  
good bam*, good farm houses go d stock,  
good orcbar !e, and childreu enough to  
gather the fruit. We believe in a clean  
kitchen, a neat wife in ir, a spinning  
piano, a clean cupboard, a clean dairy,  
and clean conscience. We firmly  
disbelieve in farmers that will not  
improve, in farmers who grow poorer  
every year; in starveling cattle, in

About f orty two years ago, the ilev.  
Henry Ward Beecher was editor 01 the  
Indiana Farmer and Gardner, a  
monthly magazine published in Indi­  
anapolis. His first work w7as to es  
tabiish a creed. Following is a copy  
of it  
&quot;We believe in small farms and  
thorough cultivation.  
&quot;We believe that soil lores to eat.  
as well as its owner, and ought, there  
fore to be manured.  
&quot;We believe in large crops which  
leave the land better than they lound  
it making both the farmer and die  
farm rich at once.  
&quot;Wo believe in going to the bottom  
of things, and. therefore, 111 deep  
ploughing, and enough of it. All the  
better with a subsoil plow.  
&quot;We be ieve that ewery farm should  
own a good farmer.  
&quot;We believe that the best fertilizer  
of any soil is a spirit of industry , en­  
terprise and intelligence without this  
lime and gypsum, bones and green  
manure, marl and guano, will be of  
little use.  
&quot;We believe in good fences, good  
barns, good farmhouse, good stock,  
good orchards and children enough to  
gather the fruit.&quot;
