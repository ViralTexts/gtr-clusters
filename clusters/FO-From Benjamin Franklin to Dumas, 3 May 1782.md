Inclos’d I send you a few copies of a Paper that places in a striking Light the English Barbarities in America, particularly those committed by the Savages at their Instigation. The Form may perhaps not be genuine but the Substance is Truth; the Number of our People of all Kinds and Ages murdered &amp; Scalp’d by these being Known to exceed that of the Invoice.— Make any use of them you may think proper to shame your Anglomanes but do not let it be Known thro’ what hands they come.

Enclosed I send you a few copies of a paper  
[Franklin wrote to a friend] that places in a strik-  
ing light, the English barbarities in America,  
particularly those committed by the savages at  
their instigation. The FORM may perhaps not  
be genuine, but the substance is truth; the number  
of our people of all kinds and ages murdered and  
scalped by them being known to exceed that of the  
invoices. Make any use of them you may think  
proper to shame your Anglomanes, but do not let  
it be known through what hand they come.
