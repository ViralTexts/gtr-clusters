or though the very relations he gives of the effects of lightning in several churches and other buildings, shows clearly that it was conducted from one part to another by wires, gildings, or other pieces of metal that were within, or connected with the building; yet in the same paper he objects to the providing metalline conductors without the building, as useless or dangerous. He cautions people not to ring the church bells during a thunder storm, lest the lightning in its way to the earth should be conducted down to them by the bell-ropes,  which are but bad conductors; and yet is against fixing rods on the outside of the steeple, which are known to be much better conductors, and which it would certainly choose to pass in, rather than in dry hemp.

If one end is held in the hand, and the other a little elevated above the level, a constant succession of large bubbles proceeds from the end in the hand to the other hand, and make an appearance that puzzled me much, till I found that the space not filled with water was also free from air; and either filled with a subtil invisible vapor continually rising from the water, and extremely rarefiable by the least heat at one end, and condensable again by the least cold at the other; or it is the very fluid of fire itself, which parting from the hand, pervades the glass, and by its expansive force depresses the water till it can pass between it and the glass, and escape to the other end, where it gets through the glass again into the air. I am rather inclined to the first opinion, but doubtful between the two. An ingenious artist here, Mr. Nairne, has made a number of them from mine, and improved them; for his are much more sensible than those I brought from Germany. I bored a very small hole through the wainscot in the seat of my window, through which a little cold air constantly entered, while the air in the room was kept warmer by fires daily made in it, being winter time. I placed one of his glasses with the elevated end against this hole, and the bubbles from the other end, which was in a warmer situation, were continually passing day and night, to the no small surprise of philosophical spectators. Each bubble discharged is larger than that from which it proceeds, and yet that is not diminished; and

It has been thought that water reduced to vapor by heat, was rarefied only 14, 000 times, and on this principle our engines for raising water by fire are said to be constructed; but if the vapor so much rarefied from water is capable of being itself still farther rarefied to a boundless degree by the application of heat to the vessels, or parts of vessels, containing the vapor, (as at first it is applied to those containing the water, ) perhaps a much greater power may be obtained with little additional expense. I think, too, that the power of easily moving water from one end to the other of a moveable beam, suspended in the middle by a small degree of heat, may be applied advantageously to some other mechanical purposes

¢ Perhaps, fays the Author, the obfervations on thefe little

It has been thought that water reduced to vapour by heat,  
was rarefied only 14,000 times ; and on this principle our  
engines for raifing water by fire are {aid to be conftruéted. But  
if the vapour fo much rarefied from water, is capable of being  
itfelf ftill farther rarefied to a boundlefs degree, by the appli-  
cation of heat to the veflels, or parts of vefiels, containing the  
vapour, (as at firft itis applied to thofe containing the water,)  
perhaps a much greater power may be obtained with little  
additional expence. Poffibly too, the power of eafily moving.

while others in which the bells were silent escaped. Notwithstanding this  
statement of a single case, we may doubt with Arago whether the acoustic  
disturbance of the air increases the danger of being struck by lightning ;  
though it may be very true that, when churches are struck, those who have  
hold of the ropes are eminently exposed to the charge. The reputation of  
the bells for preventing the strokes of lightning did not suffer by the disas-
