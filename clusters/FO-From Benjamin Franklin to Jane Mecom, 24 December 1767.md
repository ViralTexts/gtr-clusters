ch, and know it is our Duty to submit to the Divine Will, yet when it comes to our Turn to bear what so many Millions before us have borne, and so many Millions after us must bear, we are apt to think our Case particularly hard, Consolations however kindly administred seldom afford us any Relief, Natural Affections will have their Course, and Time proves our best Comforter. This I have experienc’d myself. And as I know your good Sense has suggested to you long before this time, every Argument, Motive and Circumstance that can tend in any degree to relieve your Grief, I will not by repeating them renew it. I am pleas’d to find that in your Troubles you do not overlook the Mercies of God, and that you consider as such the Children that are still spar’d to you. This is a right Temper of Mind, and must be acceptable to that beneficent Being, who is in various Ways continually showring down his Blessings upon many, that receive them as things of course, and feel no grateful Sentiments arising in their Hearts on the Enjoyment of them.

Though we know that it is our duty to sub-  
mit to the Divine Will, yet when it comes  
our turn to bear what so many before us  
have borne we are apt to think our case  
particularly hard. I am pleased to find  
that in your troubles you do not overlook  
the mercies of God. This must be accept-  
able to that Benificent Being, who is con-  
tinually showering down his blessings upon  
many, who receive them as things of course  
and feel no grateful sentiments arising in  
their hearts in their enjoyment of them.’
