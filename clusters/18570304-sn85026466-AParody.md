Tell me, ye winged winds,  
That rounds my pathway roar,  
Do ye not know some spot  
Where women fret no more?  
Some lone and pleasant dell,  
Some &quot;holler in the ground,&quot;  
Where babies never yell,  
And cradles are not found?  
The loud wind blew the snow into my face,  
And snickered as it answered—&quot;Nary place.&quot;  
  
Tell me, thou misty deep,  
Whose billows round me play,  
Know&#x27;st thou some favored spot,  
Some Island far away,  
Where weary men may find  
A place to smoke in peace,  
Were crinoline is not,  
And hoops are out of place!  
The loud waves, sounding a perpetual shout,  
Stopt for a while, and spluttered, &quot;Yeou git eout.&quot;  
  
And thou serenest moon,  
That, with such holy face,  
Dost look upon the girls  
With their beaux embrace,  
Tell me, in all thy round,  
Hast thou not seen some spot  
Where muslin is not known,  
And calico is not?  
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe,  
And a voice sweet but sad responded, &quot;Pooh!&quot;  
  
Tell me, my secret soul—  
Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,  
Is there no resting place  
From women, girls and death?  
Is there no happy spot  
Where bachelors are blessed,  
Where females never go,  
And may dwell in peace?  
Faith, Hope and Truth—best boons to mortals given—  
Waved their bright wings, and answered, &quot;Yes, in Heaven!&quot;

To chase the shadows of despair.  
My heart seems empty oftentimes—  
It once o’crtlowcd like flowers in June;  
What matter though our hearts be void,  
They’re cups that must be broken soon 1  
And yet not empty all this life;  
God never made a worthless thing—  
The linnet twittering in the fern—  
The dew-drop in the eye of Spring—  
Have uses more than we may know,  
And night has meanings, solemn, grand;  
Then back, dim doubt! this summer suu  
Hath touch me like a gentle hand!

Do ye not know some spot  
Where bachelors come no more,  
Some lone and oleasant dell  
Where no mustache is seen-  
Where long eared dandies naver come  
Ourselves and fan between?  
There came a murmur from the distant lea-  
A low, sad tone, which whispered &quot;No-siree.&quot;  
Tell me, thou misty deep,  
Whose billows round me play,  
Know&#x27;st thou some favored spot,  
Some island far away.  
Where weary girls may find  
A rest from soft dough faces,  
And hear themselves called women  
Nor likened to the graces!  
Soon did the misty deep its answer give,  
By murmuring, &quot;Not while brandy smashes live.&quot;  
And thou, serenest moon,  
What language dost thou atter,  
While gazing on the GEnTLEman  
Whose head is in the gutter?  
hast thou in thy round.  
  
Say, hast thon ii thy round,  
Gazed on some favored spot,  
Where hats knome not the reeight of bricks.  
And where cigars are not?  
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe,  
But in italics answered &quot;No, no, no.&quot;  
Pell me, my sceret soul  
tell me, Hope and Faith,  
Is there no resting place  
From fops and beaur and death!  
Is there no happy spot,  
Where womankind are blest-  
Where man may never come,  
And where the girls may rest!  
Faith, Truth and Hope--beat boons to mortals given  
Waved their bright wings and answered &quot;yes, in  
Beaven.
