On Monday about Noon, being in the Time of the General Meeting of Friends, Benjamin Lay, the Pythagorean-cynical-christian Philosopher, bore a publick Testimony against the Vanity of Tea-drinking, by devoting to Destruction in the Market-place, a large Parcel of valuable China, &amp;c. belonging to his deceased Wife. He mounted a Stall on which he had placed the Box of Ware; and when the People were gather’d round him, began to break it peacemeal with a Hammer; but was interrupted by the Populace, who overthrew him and his Box, to the Ground, and scrambling for the Sacrifice, carry’d off as much of it whole as they could get. Several would have purchas’d the China of him before he attempted to destroy it, but he refused to take any Price for it. [March 25]

, Philadelphia. [May 20]  
  
We hear from several Parts of the Country, that infinite Multitudes of black Worms or Caterpillars coming out of the Earth, threaten Destruction to the late promising Crops of Corn and Grass; large Fields being in a Day or two cut down and devoured by them, and the Ground laid bare. Considerable Mischief has likewise been done in the Pastures near this City, and many find themselves obliged to mow sooner than they intended, to save what they can. Indeed it behoves People to watch their Fields narrowly, for where no Worms have been seen on one Day, there have been Millions the next. In the Country some People to secure their Fields, run narrow Trenches round them; others where the Worms are already among the Corn, find an Advantage in running thro’ the Fi

eptember 16]  
  
Friday last was the Day of General Election throughout this Province and Territories, according to the Charter; when the following Gentlemen were chosen, viz. [Here follows the list.]  
At this Election there was a greater Number of Votes, in all the Counties of this Province, than have appear’d for several Years past: And (except in Bucks County) the Majority in favour of the old Assembly was extraordinary. In Lancaster County the highest Number for the new Candidates was 362, the old had 1480: In Chester the highest for the new was 99, the old 961: In Philadelphia County the highest for the new was 336, the old 1790.  
In this City, when the People of City and County were assembled in the Market Place, and had just begun the Choice of Inspectors, a Body of Sailors, suppos’d to be about 70 or 80, collected from several Ships in the Harbour, appear’d at the Foot of Market-Street, arm’d with Clubs, and huzzaing march’d up in a tumultuous Manner towards the People. As they were mostly Strangers, and had no kind of Right to intermeddle with the Election, and some ill Consequence was apprehended if they should be suffer’d to mix, with their Clubs, among the Inhabitants, some of the Magistrates, and other Persons of Note, met them, and endeavour’d to prevail with them to return peaceably to their Ships, but without Effect. For they fell on with their Clubs, and knocking down Magistrates, Constables, and all others who oppos’d ’em, fought their Way up to the Court-House, and clear’d the Place of Election, the People retiring into the Market-House and Second-Street in a kind of Amaze at such unexpected and unusual Treatment. After the Sailors had triumph’d awhile before the Court-house, they march’d off, and the People, without pursuing them, continued and finished their Election of Inspectors; which was no sooner done but the Sailors returning more numerous and furious than at first, fell upon the People a second time, and knock’d down all they came a-near, several were carried off for dead, and the Confusion and Terror was inexpressible. But the Inhabitants, losing at length all Patience, furnished themselves with Sticks from the neighbouring Woodpiles, and turn’d upon the Sailors, who immediately fled to their Ships and hid themselves, from whence they were drag’d out one by one, and before Night near 50 of them were committed to Prison. A good Watch was kept that Night to prevent any new Tumult, and the City has ever since been quiet.
