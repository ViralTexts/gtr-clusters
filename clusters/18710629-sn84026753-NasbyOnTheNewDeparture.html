Confederate X Roads, (wich iz in the State of Kentucky, May 24, 1871)<br/>
<br/>
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the politikle field satisfied me, some months ago, that without some shift in the position uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedingly thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Vallandygham into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisiy uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand even so sudden a change ez that! Wat I want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin outside the offices uv assessor and collector are actooatid by the same high and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so simple a process ez passin resolooshens indoose enuff dissatisfied Republikins in the close Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic President who will give us these boons, we three are for passin these resolooshens no matter what they are. This bein my understandin uv Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it to wunst.<br/>
<br/>
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Corners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That I mite get em all at one time, I waited till the regler evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good humor and ready to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very short but a very satisfactry consultashen. There wuz some objickshuns on the part uv Dimocratic idees, but Bascom settled their hash in very short metre. He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the offfises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the fullest freedom uv though and ackshen, and that every one shood express hisself untrammeled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him on that question, let him make hisself known. No sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to object dropt ez though they hed bin shot.<br/>
<br/>
It wuz determined to hold a public meetin the next nite at the church to make a public endorsement uv Vallandygum&#x27;s idees.<br/>
<br/>
Ez the principal objict uv the meetin wuz to convins the Republikins uv the doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the South really accepted the situashun, and ment, in ded ernest, to recognize the great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to hev all the niggers uv the Corners present, and saved for them the best seats in the ouse. Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I coodent help.<br/>
<br/>
I opened the exercises by making a short speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the time hed finally arriv when the lion and the lamb hed lain down together, and a small child wuz leading uv em. I knowed thet our colored fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yoosed, and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North, Vallandygum, hed spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy, and from this time henceforth and forever there wuz to be nothin but peece. I then offered the follerin resolooshen:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;*Resolved*, That the Dimocrisy uv the Yoonited States recognize the legality uv all the amendments made to the Constitooshen dooring and since the late onpleasantnis, and that they recognise and most heartily acquiesce in all the results uv the war; that they not only withdraw all their opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, but pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively by the Caucashen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev been well hed I stopped there, but I didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekness is to slop over, and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, in a spasm of delite, &quot;preset at this meetin twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin descent. Let em step forred on this platform--let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Issaker Gavitt, and eighteen other white citizens step forred also. Let them clasp each other by the hand while I wave over em a flag uv our common kontry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers stepped forred, the whites designated advanced, the two lines grasped each other by the hand, and I was about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize. He begged me to wait a minnit till he made his remark. The site afore him moved him almost to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz generous.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for ther ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern paper--alas! the Republikin party is split into fragments--remarkably small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by the Republikins uv Philadelfy on his way home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany, and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz called a convenshen, and the Noo York *Triboon* throws up the sponge and sez that nothin under the hevin can prevent the success uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, no matter who he may be or wat platform he is put onto. In view uv the disolooshen uv the Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no perteckers, it&#x27;s really generous that yoo--&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces! hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends in korious.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It hez!&quot; responded Bigler.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then,&quot; said Deekin Pogram, his eyes flashin with unwonted fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And with a strength and activity which I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin fecht the darkey whose hand he hed bin graspin, a most powerful blow atween the eyes which histed him clean off the platform, the others followed soot, and in their zeal sprang off the platform after em, and wuz a executin war dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto their prostrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from takin uv em out and hanging uv em.<br/>
<br/>
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen wuz recinded, and others adopted affirm our adherence to the constitooshen ez it yoost to be, the illegality uv the amendments, and the nateral soopremacy uv the white man over the d--d nigger, after wich we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom, and there organized fresh raids onto our nateral enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning I noticed a pecoolyer look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the nigger postmaster, bust into a roar ez I walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded the reason for his hilarity. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dat mistake ob Biglers,&quot; returned he, laughing louder than before.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turning pale, for a suspishen was creepin over me.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and--&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And all that story about the split in the Republikin party North wuz one uv his infernal lies!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case!&quot; replied the nigger, showin all his ivories. &quot;Bigler want to see ef yoor &#x27;pentance wuz genoeine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob it. He sprest a desire to assertane jist how peeceable yood be to de nigger and de Northern people down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no &#x27;Publikin party up North to hold yoo; dat wuz all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.<br/>
<br/>
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out all that he wanted to. Uv cours this &#x27;outrage,&#x27; ez they call it, will get into the Northern papers, and uv cours Vallandygum&#x27;s assershun will explode itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Bigler iz my evil genius. I shel never be able to run things ez i want to so long ez he lives.<br/>

<br/>
May 25, 1871.<br/>
<br/>
A calm and comprehensive survey<br/>
uv the politikle field satisfied me,<br/>
tome months ago, that without some<br/>
shift in the position of the Dimocracy,<br/>
oar how uv success wuz exceedingly<br/>
thin. The rezolooshens interdoost by<br/>
Vallandygum into the Convenshun of<br/>
the Dimocracy uv aionigumery coun­<br/>
ty, Ohio, wuz to me a new lite. Troo,<br/>
thev have the slite disadvantage uv<br/>
abloorin everthlng that is Dimocratic,<br/>
and uv tuttin the Dimocratic party<br/>
on purely .Republican ground, but wat<br/>
uv that 7 1 kin 8 tan a even so suaain<br/>
a change ez that. Wat I want is the<br/>
soopreme happiness uv kickin that<br/>
nigger Lubbock out nv the postofSs at<br/>
the Corners, ana uv puiun myseu in<br/>
his place, and Kernal McPelter and<br/>
Elder Pennibacker who hev bin lan-<br/>
guittbin outside the offises nv Assessor<br/>
and Collector, are actooatid by the<br/>
same hieh and holy impulses. Ef to<br/>
do this requires the ockepyin of Ke-<br/>
nublickin around, tne war cry uv us<br/>
three is &quot;ockepy.&quot; Kentucky is shoor<br/>
to go Democratic anyhow, and if we<br/>
kin by so simple a process ez passin<br/>
resoioosbens indoose enun aissausnea<br/>

states to rote with us to elect a Dimo<br/>

wuz some objecahuns on the part of a<br/>

com settled their hash in very shaft<br/>
meter. He remarkt that it wuz neces<br/>
sary that the offises be in the hands of<br/>
his friends lor odvious reasons, lie<br/>
wantid pay and he knowed uv no oth<br/>
er war to rit it. He believed in the<br/>
fullest freedom uv thought and act<br/>

It wuz determined to hold a public<br/>
meetin tne next nite at tne cnurcn to<br/>
make a public endorsement of ullan<br/>
dyeum&#x27;s idea.<br/>
tne prinsinie od ick oi me meet<br/>
in wuz to convins the Republicans uv<br/>
tiie doubtful States that the Dimocra<br/>
cv uv the South really acceptid the<br/>
situashen, and ment, in dead earnest,<br/>
to recornlze Ui irreat principle uv<br/>
equality. I arranged to have all the<br/>
nircers uv the Corners present, and<br/>
saved for em the best seats in the<br/>
house Joe. Bigler and Pollock come,<br/>
uv course, wich I coodn&#x27;t help.<br/>
I opened the exercises by makiu<br/>
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-<br/>
a leaden uv em. I knowd that our<br/>
colored fellow-citizens hed been dis-<br/>
pitefully yoosed, and that doo respeck<br/>
tied not been alluz paid to our fellow-<br/>
citizens of the North, but that time<br/>
hed now passed and I hoped forever.<br/>
The Dimocracy of the North, through<br/>
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they hed<br/>
accepted the situashen, halleloogy.and<br/>
irom mis lime nenceiortn and toreve&#x27;<br/>
there;wua to be nothing but peece. I<br/>
then offered thefollerin resolooshen:<br/>
Heolved, That the Dimocrisy of the<br/>
Yoonlted States recognize the legality<br/>
uv all the amendments made to the<br/>
Constitooshen door in and since the<br/>
onpleasantnis, and most heartily ac<br/>
quiesce in all the results uv the war<br/>
that they not only withdraw all their<br/>
oppossihen to yooniversal suffrage,<br/>
but pledge theirselves to see that eur<br/>
Airikin fellow-citizens hev not only<br/>
this right but all others heretofore en­<br/>
joyed excloosively by the Caucaben.<br/>
I put the question ez to the adop<br/>
uui uv uie raKuoosneen, ana ll wuz<br/>
carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev<br/>
bin well bed I stopped here, but I<br/>
didn&#x27;t. My prevaiiu weekness is to<br/>
slop over and I slopt on this okkashen<br/>
leariuiiy. l called upon the citizens<br/>
uv the Corners to prove their faith bv<br/>
their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said in a<br/>
spasm of delite, present at this meet<br/>
in iwetiy-two uv our fellow-citizens<br/>
nv Afrikin descent. Let em steo<br/>
Kirreru on itiia piaiform let lJeeRln<br/>
Pocram. Elder Pennibacker. Biscom.<br/>
Issaker Gavitt and eighteen other<br/>
white citizens steobed forrerd. also.<br/>
Let em clasp each other by the hand<br/>
while I wave over em the flag &quot;V our<br/>
common ken try.&quot;<br/>
It wnz done. The twenty twa nig­<br/>
gers stepped forred, the whites desig­<br/>
nated advanced, the two lines trasoed<br/>
each other by the hand, and I wnz<br/>
about to wave, when Joe Bigler riz.<br/>
He begged me to wait a minit till he<br/>
had made his remark. The site afore<br/>
him moved him almost to tecra. f &#x27;.r<br/>
he had ever harbored a susoisien that.<br/>
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the<br/>
neniucKy oreast tie took it all back<br/>
The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not onl v<br/>

A calm and comprehensive survey nv the<br/>
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,<br/>
that without some shift in the position uv<br/>
the Diinocricy, our hope uv success was ex­<br/>
ceedingly thin. The resoloosbens introdoost<br/>
by Vallandygum into the convenshua uv<br/>
the Dimocrisy uv Montgomery county,<br/>
Ohio, wuz to ine a new lite. Troo, they<br/>
hev the elite disadvantage uv abjoonn<br/>
every thing that is Ditnocratic, and<br/>
uv puttin the Dimoeratic party on<br/>
purely ltepublikin ground; but wat ol that?<br/>
I kin stand even so sudden a change as that.<br/>
YVat I want is the soopreme happiness of<br/>
kiekin that nigger Lubbock out of the post­<br/>
offis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in<br/>
his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder<br/>
Pennibackpr, who liev been languishin out­<br/>
side the ottiises uv assessor and collector,<br/>
are actooated by tbe same high and holy<br/>
impulses. Ef to do this requires the okke­<br/>
pvin uv Republican ground, the war cry uv<br/>
us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky :s shoor<br/>
to go Dimecrutic aryliow, aud it we kin by<br/>
so simple a process ez passin resoloosbens<br/>
indoose enutt&#x27;dissatistied Republikins in the<br/>
close Northern States to vote with us to<br/>
elect a Democratic president who will give<br/>
us these boons, we three are for passin these<br/>
resoloosbens,no matter wat they are. ibis<br/>
bein my uuderstandin uv Y allaudygum s<br/>
movement, I actid onto it to wunst.<br/>
I got the leedin Dimoericy uv the Cor­<br/>
ners together one nite at Baseom&#x27;s. That I<br/>
mite get era all at one time, I waited till the<br/>
regler evenin for the raid on the niggers<br/>
and Northern settlers up toards Garcetts­<br/>
town, kiiowin that, on ther return, they&#x27;d<br/>
all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that,<br/>
ef the&#x27;d bin successful in their haugin and<br/>
buruin, they&#x27;d be iu good humor and ready<br/>
to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz<br/>
a very short but a very satisfactory consul­<br/>
tasheu. There was some objeekshus on the<br/>
partuvafewto wat they called an aban­<br/>
donment uv Dimoeratic ideas, but Bascom<br/>
settled their hash in very short meter. He<br/>
remarked that it wuz necessary that the<br/>
offise8 lie in the hands uv his friends lor<br/>
ohvlus reasons. He wantid pay and he<br/>
knowed uv no other way to git ic. He be­<br/>
leeved in the fullest ifeedom uv thought<br/>
and ackshen, and that every one shood ex­<br/>
press hisself untrameled, but he coodent<br/>
abide a idiot. It&#x27; there wuz any one in that<br/>
assemblage so stoopid as to differ with him<br/>
on this question, let him make hisself<br/>
known. No sick man shood ever get a drop<br/>
at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not de­<br/>
servin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv<br/>
life. Several who liad riz to their feet to<br/>
object, dropt ez though thev hed been shot.<br/>
It wuz determined to kohl a public rneetin<br/>
the next nite at the church to make a pub­<br/>
lic endorsement of Y&#x27;allandygum&#x27;s idea.<br/>
Ez the priusiple objick of the meetin wuz<br/>
to convius the Republikins uv tlie doubtful<br/>
states that the Dimoericy of the South really<br/>
aeceptid the situashen, and meant, iu dead<br/>
earnest, to recognise the great priusiple uv<br/>
equality, 1 arranged to have all the niggers<br/>
uv the Corners present, aud saved for era<br/>
the best seats iu the house. Joe Bigler aud<br/>
Pollock come, uv course, which I coodent<br/>
help.<br/>
I opened the exercises by making a short<br/>
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist that<br/>
the time had finally arriv when the lion aud<br/>
the lamb hed layed down together anil a<br/>
small child was a leadin uv em. I knowd<br/>
that onr colored teller-citizens hed been die­<br/>
pitefully voosed. and that doo respeck bed<br/>
not bin alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv<br/>
the North, but that time hed now passed<br/>
and I hoped forever. The Dimoericy uv<br/>
the North, through Y&#x27;allaudyguin, bed spoke,<br/>
they hed accepted the situashen, halleloogy,<br/>
anil from this time henceforth anil forever<br/>
there wuz to be nothin but peeee.<br/>
Ur sol red. That the Dimoericy uv the<br/>
Y&#x27;oonited States recognize the legality uv<br/>
all the amendments made to the cous&#x27;titoo­<br/>
shen doorin and since the late onph-asant­<br/>
nis, and that they recognize and most<br/>
heartily acquiesce in all the results of the<br/>
war; that they not only w ithdraw all their<br/>
opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, lint<br/>
pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin<br/>
fellow-citizens hev not only this but all<br/>
other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively<br/>
by the Caucashen.<br/>
I pnt the question ez to the adopshen uv<br/>
the resolushen, and it wuz carried yoonani­<br/>
mouslv. It wood av bin well lied I stopped<br/>
here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. Mv prevaliu weakness<br/>
is to slop over, aud I slopped on this ukka­<br/>
sion fearfully. I called upon the citizens<br/>
uv the Corners to prove their faith by their<br/>
works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, iu a spasm uv<br/>
delite, &quot;present at this meetin twenty-two<br/>
uv our fellow citizens uv Afrikin descent.<br/>
Let em step forrerd on this platform—let<br/>
Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibaeker. Bas­<br/>
com, Issacker Gavitt, aud eighteen other<br/>
white citizens step forrerd also. Let them<br/>
clasp each other by the hand, while I wave<br/>
over em the flag of our common kentrv.&quot;<br/>
It was done. The twenty-two niggers<br/>
stepped forrerd, the whites designated ad­<br/>
vanced, the two lines grasped each other by<br/>
the hand, aud I was about to wave, when<br/>
J&lt;^&gt; Bigler riz. He begged me to wait a<br/>
minit till he hed made Ins remark. The site<br/>
atore him moved him almost tu teers. Ef<br/>
he hed harbored a suspiskeu that there<br/>
wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky<br/>
breast, he took it all hack. The action uv<br/>
to-uite wuz not only just but it wuz gen­<br/>
erous.<br/>
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;wby generous ?&quot;<br/>

ral who lied riz to their feet to object<br/>

It wuz determined to hold a public meet­<br/>
in the next nite at the church to make a<br/>
public endorsement uv Yallandygum’s<br/>
idees.<br/>

J&#x27;.z me pnnsipai object uv the meetin<br/>

doubtful Suites that the Pimoerasy uv the<br/>
South really accepted the situashou, and<br/>
nient, in tied earnest, to recognize the<br/>
great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to<br/>
hev all the niggers uv the Corners present<br/>
and saved for ent the best seats in the<br/>
house. Joe Bigler and Pollock cum uv<br/>
eoorse, which L coodent help.<br/>
1 opened Ihe exercises by makin a short<br/>
speech ez I took the chair. L rejoist that<br/>
the time had finally arriv when the lion<br/>
and the lamb bed layed down together,<br/>
and a small child wuz a leadin uv cm. I<br/>
knowed that our colored fellow-citizens<br/>
lied bin dispitefully yoosed, and that doo<br/>
respeek hed not bin alluz paid to our fel­<br/>
low-citizens uv the North, but that time<br/>
hed now passed, aud 1 hoped forever.<br/>
The Pimocrisy uv the North, through<br/>
Yallandygum, hed spoke, they hed ac­<br/>
cepted the situashen, halleloogv, and from<br/>
this time henceforth and forever there<br/>
wuz to lie nothiu but peace. 1 then offer­<br/>
ed the following resotooshen:<br/>
Resolved. That the Pimocrisy uv the<br/>
Yoonited States, recognize the legality uv<br/>
all the amendments made to the Consti­<br/>
toosheu dooring and since the late on­<br/>
pleasantnis, and that they recognize and<br/>
most heartily acquiesce in all the results<br/>
uv the war; that they not only withdraw<br/>
all their opposhen to yooniversal suffrage,<br/>
but pledge theirselves to see that our Afri­<br/>
kin fellow-citizens hev not only tills but<br/>
all other rites heretefore enjoyed cxeloo­<br/>
sively by the Caucashen.<br/>
<br/>
1 put the question ez to the aitopshen uv<br/>
the resoloosheu, and it wuz carried yoo­<br/>
nauimusly. It wood liev bin well bed I<br/>
stopped here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. My prevalin<br/>
weekness is to slop over and I slopt on<br/>
this okknsion uv the Corners to prove their<br/>
faith by their works. ‘There are,’ I said,<br/>
in a spasm of delitc, ‘present at this<br/>
meetin twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens<br/>
uv Afrikin descent. Let cm step forred<br/>
on this platform—let Deckin Togram,<br/>
Elder Pennibacker.Uascom, IssakerGavitt<br/>
and eighteen other white citizens step for­<br/>
red. also. Let them clasp each other by<br/>
the hand while I wave over em the flag uv<br/>
our common kentry.’<br/>
It was done. The twenty-two niggers<br/>
stepped forred, the whites designated ad­<br/>
vanced, the two lines grasped each other<br/>
by the hand, and I wuz about to wave,<br/>
when Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to<br/>
wait a rninit till lie had made his remark.<br/>
The site afore him moved him almost to<br/>
teers. Kf he lied ever harbored a suspish­<br/>
eu that there wuzn’t anything generous in<br/>
the Kentucky breast, lie took it all back.<br/>
The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not only just,<br/>
but it was generous.<br/>
“Generous!” sed I, “ why generous?”<br/>
“Becoz,” sed he, “the niggers wood be<br/>
in a devilish bad way cf yoo liedn’t decided<br/>
on givin em their rites, uv yoor own ak­<br/>
kord, for there aiut no power now that kin<br/>
compel yoo to do it. i jist got a northern<br/>
paper—alas! the Kepublikin party is split<br/>
<br/>
into fragments—remarkably small frag­<br/>
ments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the<br/>
Capitol last Monday, Logan hez bin ston­<br/>
ed by the Ilepublkins uv Philadelfy on his<br/>
way home, the Central Committees uv<br/>
Ohio, Injeny and lllinoy, hev divided, and<br/>
each ftackshen hez called a convenshen,<br/>
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the<br/>
sponge and sez that nothin under heven<br/>
kin prevent the success uv the Democratic<br/>
candidate for the Presidency, no matter<br/>
who he may be or wat platform he is pi^t<br/>
onto. In view uv the dissolooshen uv the<br/>
Republikin party, and the fact that the<br/>
niggers aint how got no perteckters, its<br/>
really generous that voo——”<br/>
“The Republikin party is gone to pieces!<br/>
hez it? gapped my twentjySW white<br/>
friends in korious.” &quot;<br/>
“It hez.” responded &#x27;<br/>
“Then,&quot; sed Deekin Ingram, his eyes<br/>
flashin with unwontid fire, “What we’ve<br/>
done and sed don’t count! Take that, you<br/>
black cuss!” t ( -*<br/>
Ami with a strength and activity wich I<br/>
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin<br/>
feclit the darkey whose hand he hed bin<br/>
graspin a most powerful blow atween the<br/>
eyes, which lusted him clean off the plat­<br/>
form. The others follered soot, and in<br/>
their zeal sprang off the platform after eni,<br/>
and wuz a exeeutin war dances uv the<br/>
most frantic descripshen onto their pros­<br/>
trate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that<br/>
Pollock and Bigler restrained em from<br/>
takin uv em out and hangin uv em.<br/>
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen<br/>
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirmiu<br/>
our adherence to the constooshen ez it<br/>
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­<br/>
ments, and the nateral soopremaPy uv the<br/>
white man over the d—d nigger, after wich<br/>
we adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our cus­<br/>
tom, and there organized fresh raids onto<br/>
our natural enemies.<br/>
The next mornin I notised a pecoolyer<br/>
look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pol­<br/>
lock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed,<br/>
with a broadnis I couldn’t account for.<br/>
Lubbock, the nigger Postmaster, bust into<br/>
a roor ez I walked into his offis, and I an­<br/>
grily demandid the reason for his hilarity.<br/>
“Dat mistake of Bigler’s,” returned he,<br/>
laughin’ louder than before.<br/>
“What mistake?” I asked, turnin pale,<br/>
for a suspishun wuz creepin over me.<br/>
“Why, he didn’t get no papers at all,<br/>
and—’’<br/>
<br/>
“Anil all that story about that split in<br/>
the Republiken party North wuz one uv<br/>
his infernal lies!’’<br/>
“Dat&#x27;s about lie correct state ob de case!”<br/>
replied the nigger showin all his ivories,<br/>
“liigler wanted to see ef yoor pentance<br/>
wuz &quot;enooine—dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob<br/>
it. lie ’sprest a desire to assertane jist<br/>
how peeceable yood be to de nigger and<br/>
do Northern people down heali, ef dah<br/>
wuzn’t no Tublikin party up North to hold<br/>
yoo; dat wuz all.”<br/>
And the nigger luffed a feendish laff.<br/>
&quot;Dat wuz all!” he repeated.<br/>
It wuz euuff. I guess the cuss found out<br/>
all that he wanted to. Uv course this ‘out­<br/>
rage,’ cz they call it, will get into the<br/>
Northern papers, and uv course Vallandy­<br/>
gum’s assershuns will explode itself with­<br/>
out hurtiu anybody. Joe Bigler is my<br/>
evil genius. 1 she! never be able to ruu<br/>
things ez I want to so long ez he lives.<br/>

May 24, 1871.<br/>
A cam and rnraorehen.ivo survey uv the<br/>
pnlitikle field s-itifiid me, some months<br/>
ago, that without some shift in tbe pnsisb­<br/>
un uv the Dimncrisy, our hope uv success<br/>
wui exceedinly thin. The reso&#x27;ooshens in­<br/>
terdoist I y Vallandygiim into the Cnnven­<br/>

County. Ohio, wuz tn me a new lite. Tron,<br/>
they hev the slite disadvantage nv nbjonrin<br/>
everything that.is Dimncratic nnd nv put­<br/>
tin the Dimocratie party on purely Brpnh­<br/>
likin ground, hut wnt ur that? I kin stand<br/>
even so sudden a change rz that. Wnt I<br/>
want, is the annprcme happiness ov kiekin<br/>
that nigger Lnbhnck out nv the pest nffis at<br/>

nibacVer, who hey bin langntshin outside<br/>

aetnoatid by tho same high nnd holy im<br/>
pulse. Ef tn do this requires the okkepv-<br/>

tn go Dimocritic anyhow, nnd if we kin.<br/>
hy so simple a process ez pasain resnl.io­<br/>

with us to el-ct a Dimocratia President win<br/>
will give us these boons we theeo nre for<br/>
pasain these resnlooshens, no matter wat<br/>
they are. This bein my understandin uv<br/>
Vnllandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it<br/>
to wunst.<br/>
I got the leedin Diraocraev uv the Cor<br/>
ners tngether nnc nite nt Biscim&#x27;s. Th it<br/>
I mite git em all nt one tim, I waited till<br/>
the regler tvenin for the raid on the nig­<br/>
gers and Northern settlers np toards G ir­<br/>
retutown, knowin that on their return<br/>
they&#x27;d nil stop nt B iscom&#x27;s for n drink, nnd<br/>
that t f they&#x27;d bin succ-ssful in ther hangin<br/>
nnd burnin, they&#x27;d he in good humor, nnd<br/>
reddv tn ndopt anything I shood sejest.<br/>
It wuz a very short but a very satisfactory<br/>
consult isben. Ther wuz some objecksbuns<br/>
on tho part uv n few to wat they called a<br/>
abandonment uv Dimocratie ijces, but Bas­<br/>
eom settle I ther hash in very short metre.<br/>
II&#x27; remarkt that it wuz neas irv tb it the<br/>

knnwed uv no other way to git it. n<br/>
beleeyed in the fullest frcednum uv thought<br/>
nnd ackshen. nnd that every one shood ex­<br/>
press hisself untrimelcd, but be coodent<br/>
nhide. a idiot. If ther wuz nnv nnc in that<br/>
assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him<br/>
on this question, let him make hisself<br/>

the time bed finally arriv vcben tbe lion and<br/>
the Iamb bed laved down together, nnd a<br/>

that our colored feller-citizens hed bindis-pit-folly<br/>

thev bed accepted tbe situaaben, hnlleloogy,<br/>
and from this time henceforth and forever<br/>
ther wuz to bo nothin but peece. I then<br/>
offered the follerin rsnlnshen:<br/>

imusly. It rn hev bin well lied I stop­<br/>

It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers<br/>

Ef be bed ever harbored a srjspisben that<br/>

And with a strength nnd activity wich 1<br/>

fecht the darkey, whose band be hed bin<br/>

And the nigger laded a feendish laff.<br/>
&quot;Oat wuz ill!&quot; be repeated.<br/>
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out<br/>

the constooshen ez it youst to be,<br/>

white man over tho d—d nigger,<br/>
after wich we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s,<br/>
ez is our custom, and there organized<br/>
fresh raids onto our natural enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The next mornin I notised a pe­<br/>
coolyer look on Biglor&#x27;s face, and<br/>
likewise on Pollock&#x27;s. They grinned<br/>
at me ez I passed, with a broadnis<br/>
wioh I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lub­<br/>
bock, the nigger Postmaster, burst<br/>
into a roar ez I walked into bis offis,<br/>
and I angrily demanded the reasAn<br/>
or his hilarity.<br/>
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; return­<br/>
ed he, laughing londer than before<br/>
&quot;What mistake I asked turnin<br/>
pale, for a suspicion was creepin<br/>
nver me.<br/>
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at<br/>
all, and<br/>
<br/>
And all that story about the split<br/>
<br/>
in the Republican party North, was<br/>
one of hici infernal lies<br/>
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de oorreot state ob de<br/>
case!1&#x27; replied the nigger, showing<br/>
all his iv«iries. &quot;Bigler wanted to<br/>
sea if your pentance was genooine—<br/>
dat&#x27;s about all dab wuz OD it. Ho<br/>

itizens had been ilispitefully yoosed, mid ,<br/>
that the reaped; hnd not bin nlluz paid In 1<br/>
our fellow-flitl/ens uv the North, hut that<br/>
time hed now passed and 1 hoped forever. I<br/>
The denioerisy uv the North, through<br/>
Viillandygum, hod npoke; thry had tie*<br/>
rented the situation, halleloogy, mid I&#x27;roni i<br/>
this time heneelorth and forever there wu/, i<br/>
tithe iiothin&#x27; hut peeee. I then offered<br/>
the following resolution: 1<br/>
&quot;Itesohnl,That Alio.duinocrisy of the 1<br/>
Voonited Htates recogui/.e the legality uv 1<br/>
all the ameudmentH made to tUecousti<br/>
tooshen dottrln and Hiuee the late unpleiiH (<br/>
unmix, and that they reiognizo ami most ,<br/>
heartily aetpileseo in nil tin* results uv the<br/>
war; that they|nol only withdraw all their<br/>
<br/>
opposlshen to yoonlvcrsal suH&#x27;rage, hut 1<br/>
pledge thelraelvcH to sen that our Alrikin<br/>
follow citizens liev not only tliin, Init nil<br/>
other rites heretofore exelooftlvely ?&#x27;n<br/>
joyed by the Caueaalien.&quot;<br/>
I put the question ez to the ado|&gt;shcu<br/>
uv tin* reaoloouhen, mid It was carried<br/>
yoonanlmously. It wood hev bin well<br/>
iied I stopped there, hut I didn&#x27;t. My<br/>
prevailing weakness is to ?lopover, and I<br/>
slnpton this okkaslon tearfully. I railed<br/>
upon the citizens uv the Comers to prove<br/>
their faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I<br/>
saiil iu a spasm ot dclite, &quot;present at this<br/>
meeting twenty-two uv our fellow citizens<br/>
ill Alrikin descent. Let em steo lorred<br/>

when Joe Hfglor riz. Ilo Jiegged mn to n<br/>

The Bit?&#x27; afore him moved him almost to |<br/>

Xasby on the Mew Departure.<br/>
[From the Toledo Blade ]<br/>
Confedrit X Roads,<br/>
(wieh iz in the State of Kentucky.)<br/>
May 24, 1871.<br/>
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the<br/>
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,<br/>
that without some shift in the position uv the<br/>
Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedinly<br/>
thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Yallandyghatn<br/>
into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisy<br/>
uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a<br/>
new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage<br/>
uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and<br/>
uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin<br/>
ground, but wat uv that ? I kin stand<br/>
! even so sudden a change ez that! Wat 1 want<br/>
iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger<br/>
Lubbock out uv the postofiis at the Corners,<br/>
and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel<br/>
McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bio<br/>
languishiu outside the offices uv assessor and<br/>
collector are actooatid by the same high and<br/>
holy impulses. Ef to Jo this requires the<br/>
okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry<br/>
uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor<br/>
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so<br/>
simple a process ez nassin resolooshens iudoose<br/>
enuff dissatisfied Uepublikins in the close<br/>
Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic<br/>
President who will give us these boons,<br/>
we three are for passin these resolooshens no<br/>
matter what they are. This bein my uuderstandin<br/>
uv \ allandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid<br/>
onto it to wunst.<br/>
1 fi-ot the leedin D mncriav uv fKo I V.rrw?ru<br/>
<br/>
together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That 1 mite<br/>
get em all at ooe time, I waited till the regler<br/>
evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern<br/>
settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that<br/>
on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for<br/>
a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in<br/>
their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good<br/>
humor and ready to adopt anything I shood<br/>
suggest. It vruz a very short but a very satisfactry<br/>
oonsultashen. There wuz some objiekshuns<br/>
on the part uv a few to wat tbey called<br/>
an abandonment uv Dimoeratic idees, but Bas<br/>
com settled their hash in very short metre.<br/>
He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the<br/>
offises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius<br/>
reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv<br/>
no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the<br/>
fullest freedom uv thought and ackshen, and<br/>
that every one shood express hisself untrarameled,<br/>
but he coodent abide a idiot. If there<br/>
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez<br/>
to differ with him on that question, let him<br/>
make hisself known. No sick man shood ever<br/>
git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz<br/>
not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries<br/>
uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to<br/>
<br/>
object dropt ez though they hed bio shot.<br/>
It wuz determined to bold a public meetin<br/>
the next nite at the church to make a public<br/>
endorsement uv Yallandygum&#x27;s idees.<br/>
Ez the prinsipal objict uv the meetin wuz to<br/>
convins the Republikios uv the doubtful States<br/>
that the Diinocrisy uv the South really accepted<br/>
the situashun, and meat, in ded ernest, to recognise<br/>
the great priosiple uv equality, I arranged<br/>
to hev all the niggers u v the Corners present,<br/>
and saved for thcra the best seats in the house.<br/>
Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I<br/>
ooodont help.<br/>
I opened the exercises by making a short<br/>
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the<br/>
time hed finally arriv when the lion and the<br/>
lamb hed laid down together, and a small child<br/>
wuz leading uv em. 1 knowed thet our colored<br/>
fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yooaed,<br/>
and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid<br/>
to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that<br/>
time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The<br/>
Dimucrisy uv the North, Vrallandygum, hed<br/>
spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy,<br/>
and from this time henceforth and forever<br/>
there wuz to be notbin but peece. i then<br/>
offered the follerm resoloosheu :<br/>
&quot;Resolved, That the Diinocrisy uv the Yoouited<br/>
States recognize the legality uv all the<br/>
amendments made to the Constituoshen dooring<br/>
and since the late onpleaBantnis, and that they<br/>
recognise aud most heartily acquiesce in all the<br/>
results uv the war ; that they not ouly withdraw<br/>
all their opposisben to yooniversal suffrage,<br/>
but pledge theirselves to see that our<br/>
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but<br/>
all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively<br/>
by the Caucashen.&quot;<br/>
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the<br/>
reaolooshen, aud it wuz carried yoonanimusly.<br/>
It wood hev bin well hed I stopped here, but I<br/>
didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekuess is to slop over,<br/>
and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called<br/>
upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their<br/>
faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; 1 said, in<br/>
a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this meetin<br/>
twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin<br/>
descent. Let em step forrerd on this platform<br/>
P lmj?i&gt; :i?i? u -<br/>
<br/>
?ici i/ccaiu a g^raui, liiun i cuuiuftuher, i&gt;iis<br/>
com, Issaker Guvitt, and eighteen other white<br/>
citizens step forrerd also. Let them clasp<br/>
each other by the hand while 1 wave over em<br/>
the flag uv our common kontry.&quot;<br/>
It wuz done. The twenty-two uiggers stepped<br/>
forrerd, the whites designated advanced,<br/>
the two lines grasped each other by the hand,<br/>
and I wuz about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize.<br/>
Ho begged me to wait a minnit till he hed made<br/>
hia remark. The site afore him moved him almost<br/>
to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen<br/>
that there wuzu&#x27;t anything generous in<br/>
the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The<br/>
acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz<br/>
generons.<br/>
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a<br/>
devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given<br/>
them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for there<br/>
ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do<br/>
it I jist got a Northern paper?alas! the Kepublikin<br/>
party is split into fragments?remarkably<br/>
small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner<br/>
in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by<br/>
the Kepublikins uv Philadelfy on hiz way<br/>
home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany,<br/>
and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz<br/>
called a convenshen, and the Noo York<br/>
Triboon throws up the sponge and sez that<br/>
notbin under the hevin Wo prevent the success<br/>
uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency,<br/>
no matter who he may be or wat platform be is<br/>
put onto. In view uv the dissoloosben uv the<br/>
Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers<br/>
ain&#x27;t now got no perteckters, its really generous<br/>
that yoo &quot;<br/>
&quot; The Kepublikin party is gone to pieces!<br/>
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends<br/>
in korions.<br/>
&quot; It hez 1&quot; responded Bigler.<br/>
&quot; Then,&quot; said Deo kin Pogr&amp;ui, his eyes flashin<br/>
with unwonted fire, &quot; what we&#x27;ve dene and<br/>
and don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss ?&quot;<br/>
And with a strength and activity wich I<br/>
hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deck in<br/>
fecht the darkey whose hand he bed bin graspin,<br/>
a most powerful blow atweea the eyes which<br/>
histed him clean off the plutform, the others<br/>
followered soot, and in their zeal sprang off the<br/>
<br/>
platform after em, aad wax a executia war<br/>
dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto<br/>
their proatrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty<br/>
that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from<br/>
takin uv em out and hanging uv em.<br/>
Ez a matter uv course the reaalooshen wuz<br/>
reminded, and others adopted affirmin our ad&#x27;<br/>
bereoce to the constitoosbatf ez it yoost to bo,<br/>
the illegality uv the amendments, and the<br/>
natural soopremacy uv the white man over the<br/>
1 d?4 nigger, after wich we adjourned to Basoom&#x27;s,<br/>
ex is our custom, and there organized<br/>
frfih raids onto our nateral enemies<br/>
The next morning 1 notised a pecoolyer look<br/>
&#x27; oa Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s,<br/>
frinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis<br/>
wich I oauldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the<br/>
1 postmaster, bust into a roar ez 1 walked<br/>
4nto bis offis, and I angrily demanded the rea­<br/>
son for has hilarity.<br/>
*&#x27; LhSl mistake ob Biglers,&#x27;* returned be,<br/>
laughHbg loader than before.<br/>
&quot; What mistake?&quot; 1 asked, turning pale, fo:<br/>
a suspishen was creepin over me.<br/>
44 Whv, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and?&#x27;<br/>
&quot;And all that story about the split in the<br/>
Republikiu party North wuz one uv his infer<br/>
nalliee!&quot;<br/>
44 Bat&#x27;s about de oorreet state ob de cess 1&quot;<br/>

M Bigler wanted to see ef yoor &#x27;pentance wui<br/>

tbatdoo redpeck bed not bin allaz paid to cur<br/>
fellow-citizens uv the North, but that time hed<br/>
now paaed and I hoped forever. The Ihmocrisy<br/>
ut the North, through VaUandjgiun, bed ppoke,<br/>
they bed acceptid the situsjben,halleloogy, and<br/>
from this time henceforth and forever there wuz<br/>
to be nothm but peeoe. I then offered the fbllenn<br/>
ret aloof ben :<br/>
Rewired, That the Dimoerify uv the Voonited<br/>
States recognize the legality uv all th amend­<br/>
ments made the the conetitooBheo do .in and<br/>
ince the late onpleacantnis, and that they re­<br/>
cognize and most heartily acquire oe in all the<br/>

all their opposisben to yoinivereal satfraje, bat<br/>
pledge theirselfes to tee that our Afnkin rellow­<br/>

It wood bev bin well bed I stopped here, bat I<br/>
didn&#x27;t. My prevailin weakDese if to slop over<br/>
and I plopt on thip okkishun fearfully. I called<br/>
upon the citizens ut the Corners to prove their<br/>
faith by their works. 44 There are, I Fed, in a<br/>
ppwm of delite, present at this meeting twenty­<br/>
two uv oar fellow-citizens uv Afrikin descent.<br/>
Let em Etep forrcrd on this platform let leekin<br/>

wuz about to wave, wben Joe Bigler riz He<br/>
begged me to wait a minit till he bad made his<br/>
remark. The site afore him moved him almost<br/>
tu teers. Efhebed ever harbored a puspishen<br/>
that there wazn&#x27;t anything generou in the<br/>
Kentucky breast he took it all back. The ack­<br/>
fben uv to-night wuz not only just, but it wuz<br/>

1 just got t Northern paper alas &#x27; the K?pub­<br/>

small fragments. Grant totalled Suiuner in<br/>
the Capitol, last Monday. Logan ber beesi atoned<br/>
by the Republikins of PhiUJelfy on his way<br/>
home, the central committees av Ohio, Injeaoy<br/>
and Illinoy her divided, and each frackshen hex<br/>
called a conventhen, and the New lorkTribouc<br/>
throws tip the sponge and sez that nothing ander<br/>
herin kin prevent the success av the Democratic<br/>
candidate tor the Presidency, no matter who be<br/>
may be or wat platform be is pat onto. In view<br/>
uv the disfcolooeben av the Kepubhkio part,<br/>
and the tact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now go; no<br/>
perteckters, its really generous that yoo &#x27;<br/>
The Kepublikin party is gone to piece faei<br/>

most frantic descripbhun onto their prostrate<br/>
belies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and<br/>
Bigler restrained em from taxin uv em oat and<br/>

Ez a matter ut coarse the resolasion wuz re­<br/>
scinded, and others adopted affirm in our adhe­<br/>

our custom, and there organised fresh raid onto<br/>

The next mornin I itotised a pecoolyer look on ;<br/>

<br/>
A calm and comprehensive survey uv tbe<br/>

ConfedritX Roads, (which is the state<br/>
of Kentucky,) May 31, 1871. A calm<br/>
and comprehensive survey uv the politi­<br/>
kle field satisfied me, some months ago,<br/>
that without some shift in the position<br/>
uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success<br/>
was exceedingly thin. The resolooshens<br/>
introdoost by Vallandygum into the con­<br/>
venshun, Ohio, wuz to me a new lite.<br/>
Troo, they hev the elite disadvantage uv<br/>
abjoorin evrything that is Dimocratic,<br/>
and uv puttin the Dimocratic party .on<br/>
purely Republikin ground, but wat uv<br/>
that? I kin stand even so sudden a<br/>
change ez that. Wat I want is the soo­<br/>
preme happiness uv kickin that nigger<br/>
Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Cor­<br/>
ners, and uv puttin myself in his place,<br/>
and Kernel MePelter and Elder Pen<br/>
nibacker who hev bin languishin out­<br/>
side the office uv assessor and collector<br/>
are actooated by the same high and holy<br/>
impulses. Ef to do this requires the ok-<br/>
kepyin uv Republican grounds, the war<br/>
cry uv us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky<br/>
is shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and<br/>
if we kin by so simple a process ez passin<br/>
resolooshens indoose enufl dissatisfied Re-<br/>
publikins in the close Northern states to<br/>
vote with us to elect a Democratic pres­<br/>
iueut who will give ns these boons, we<br/>
three are for passin these resolooshens<br/>
no matter wat they are. This being my<br/>
understands uv Vallandygum&#x27;s move­<br/>
ment, I actid onto to it at wunst.<br/>
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Cor<br/>

I might get em all at one time, I waited<br/>

in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in<br/>

they called an abandonment uv Dimo­<br/>

hash in very short metre. He remarked<br/>
that it wuz necessary that the offises be<br/>
in the hands uv his trends for obvius rea<br/>
sons. He wantid pay and knowed uv<br/>
no other way to git it. He beloeved in<br/>
the fullest freedom uv thought and ack-<br/>
shen, and that every one shood express<br/>
hisself untrameled, but he coodent abide<br/>
a idiot. If there wuz any one in that<br/>
assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with<br/>
him on this question, let him make his<br/>
self known. No sich man shood ever git<br/>
a drop at his bar, never ; sich a one wuz<br/>
not deservin uv even the commonest nes-<br/>
esaries uv life. Several who had riz to<br/>
their feet to object, dropt ez though they<br/>
hed been shot.<br/>
It was determined to hold a public<br/>
meeting the next nite at the church to<br/>
hold make a public indorsement uv Val­<br/>
landygum&#x27;s idea.<br/>
Ez the principle object of the meetin<br/>
wuz to convins the Republikins uv the<br/>
doubtful states that the Dimocrisy uv<br/>
the South really acceptid the situashen,<br/>
and ment, in dead earnest, to recognise<br/>
the great prinsiple uv equality, I arrang­<br/>
ed to hev all the niggers uv the Corners<br/>
present, and saved for em the best seats<br/>
in the house. Joe Bigler and Pollock<br/>
come, uv course, which I coodent help.<br/>
I opened the exercises by making a<br/>
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-<br/>
joist that the time hed finally arriv when<br/>
the lion and the Iamb bed layed down<br/>
together and a small child wuz a leadin<br/>
uv em. I knowd that our coloredfellow-citizens<br/>
hed bin dispitefully yoosed,<br/>
and that doo res peck hed net bin alluz<br/>
paid to onr fellow-citizens uv the North,<br/>
but that time hed now passed and I hop<br/>
ed forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North,<br/>
though Vallandygum, hed spoke, they<br/>
bed acceptid the situashen, halleloogy,<br/>
<br/>
and from this time henceforth and forev­<br/>
er there wuz to be nothin but peeoe. I<br/>
then offered the follerin resolooshea :<br/>
HnmlvrH, That the Dimocrwy uv the<br/>
Yoouited States recognizo the legality<br/>
uv all the amendments made the const!­<br/>
tooehon doorin and since the late onpleas­<br/>
antnis, aud that they recognize and most<br/>
heartily acquiesce in all the results of<br/>
the war ; that they not only withdraw all<br/>
their opposishen to yooniyersal suffrage,<br/>
but pledge theirselves to see that our<br/>
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this<br/>
but all other rites heretofore enjoyed ex­<br/>
cloosively by the Caucashen.<br/>
It put the question ez to theadopshen<br/>
uv the resolooshen, and it was carried<br/>
yoonnanimously. It wood hev bin well<br/>
hed I stopped here, but I didn&#x27;t. My<br/>
prevailin weakness is to slop over and I<br/>
sloptonthis okkashun TearluIIy, I cal­<br/>

vitt and eighteen others white citizens<br/>
step forrerd, also. Let them clasp each<br/>
other by the hand while I wave over em<br/>
the flag uv our common kentry.&quot;<br/>
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers<br/>
stepped forrered, the whites designated<br/>
advanced, the two lines grasped each<br/>
other by the hand, and I wuz about to<br/>
wave, when Joe Bigler riz. He begged<br/>
me to wait a minit till he had made his<br/>
remark. The site afore him moved him<br/>
almost tu teers. Ef he hed ever harbor­<br/>
ed a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t any­<br/>
thing generous in the Kentucky breast<br/>
he took it all back. The ackshen uv to­<br/>
night wuz not only just, but it wuz gen­<br/>
erous.&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous ?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, &quot;the niggers wood &quot;be<br/>
in a devilish bad way ef you hedn&#x27;t de<br/>
cided on givin em their rites, uv yoor<br/>
own akkord, for there ain&#x27;t nopower new<br/>
that can compel yoo to do it. I just<br/>
got a Northern paper alas ! the Repub­<br/>
lisiu party is split into fragments re­<br/>
markably small fragments. Grant as­<br/>
saulted Sumner in the Capitol, last Mon­<br/>
day, Logan hez been stoned by the Re­<br/>
publikins of Philadelfy on his way home,<br/>
the ceutral committees uv Ohio, Injeany<br/>
and Illinoy hev divided, and each frack­<br/>
uhen hez called a convenshen, and the<br/>
New York Triboon throws up the sponge<br/>
and sez that nothing under heven kin<br/>
prevent the success uv the Democratic<br/>
candidate for the Presidency, no matter<br/>
who be may be or wat platform he is<br/>
put onto. In yiew uv the dissolooshen<br/>
uv the Republikin party, and the fact<br/>
that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no per­<br/>
teckters, its really generous that yoo &quot;<br/>
The Republikin party is gone to piec­<br/>
es ! hez it ?&quot; graBxed my twenty -two<br/>
white friends in korious.<br/>
&quot;It hez I&quot; responded Bigler.<br/>
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Deekin Pogram, his eyes<br/>
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve<br/>
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, yoo<br/>
black cuss !&quot; . . ;<br/>
And, with the strength and activity<br/>
wich I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid,<br/>
the deekin fecht the damey, whose hand<br/>
he hed bin graspin, a most powerful<br/>
blow atween the eyes wich histed him<br/>
clean off the platform. The others fol­<br/>
lowed soot, and in their zeal sprang off<br/>
the platform after em, and wuz a execu­<br/>
tin war dances of the most frantic des­<br/>
cripihun onto thoir prostrate bodies. It<br/>
wuz with difficulty that Pollock and<br/>
Bigler restrained em from takin uv em<br/>
out and hangin uv em.<br/>
Ez a matter uv course the resolusion<br/>
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirm­<br/>
in our adherence to the constooshen ez it<br/>
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­<br/>
ments, and the nateral soopremacy uv<br/>
the white man over the d d nigger, aft­<br/>
er wich we adjou-ned to Bascom&#x27;s, ex is<br/>
our custom, and there organised fresh<br/>
raids onto our nateral enemies. &#x27;<br/>
The next mornin I notised a pecool­<br/>
yer look on Bigler&#x27;s face, and likewise<br/>
on Pollock&#x27;s. .They grinned at me ez I<br/>
passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t<br/>
account for. Lubbock, the nigger p ost­<br/>
m aster, bust into a roar ez I walkt into<br/>
his oflis, and I angrily demanded the<br/>
reason for his hilarity.<br/>
&quot;Dat mistake of ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned<br/>
he, laughing louder than before.<br/>
&quot;What mistake,&quot; I asked, turning<br/>
pale, for a suspicion wuz creepin. over<br/>
me.<br/>
&quot;Why he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all,<br/>
and&#x27;<br/>
&quot;And all that story about the split in<br/>
the republikin party North wuz one uv<br/>
his infernal lies!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de<br/>
case !&quot; replied the nigger, showing all<br/>
his iveries. &quot;Bigler wanted to see if<br/>
yourpretauce wuzgenooine dat&#x27;sabout<br/>
all dah wuz ob it. He&#x27; sprest a desire<br/>
to aseertane jist how peeceable yood be<br/>
to de nigger and de Northern people<br/>
down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no&#x27; Publican<br/>
party up North to hold yoo ; dat wus<br/>
all.&quot;<br/>
And the niggers laffed a feendish laff.<br/>
&quot;Dat wuz all !&quot; he repeated.<br/>
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found<br/>
out all he wanted to. Uv course this<br/>
&quot;outrage,&quot; as they will call it, will get<br/>
into the Northern papers, and course<br/>
Vallandygum&#x27;s asserchun will explode<br/>
itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Big.<br/>

Confkdrit X Roaps (which ia iu the<br/>
State of Keutucky), May 24, 1871. A<br/>
calm and comprehensive survey uv the<br/>
the politikle field satisfied me, some<br/>
months ago, that without some shift iu the<br/>
position uv the Dimocricy our hope uv<br/>
success wuz exceedingly thin. The<br/>
resolooshens interdooat by Yallandygtim<br/>
into the Convenshuu of the Dimocricy<br/>
uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wua to he<br/>
a new life. Troo, they hev the slite dis­<br/>
advantange uv abjoorio everything that<br/>
is Democratic, afid uv puttin the Dem­<br/>
cratic party on purely Republikiu grouud,<br/>
but what uv that ? I kin st tud even so<br/>
sudden a change ez that. Wat I waut<br/>
is the soopreme happiness uv kickin that<br/>
nigger Lubbock ont uv the postoflis at<br/>
the Corners, and uv puttin myself in his<br/>
place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder<br/>
Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin<br/>
outside the office nv Assessor and Collec­<br/>
tor are actooatid by the same high and<br/>
holy impulses. Ef to do this requires<br/>
the okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the<br/>
war cry uv us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Ken­<br/>
tucky is shoor to go Democrilic anyhow,<br/>
aud if we kin by so simple a process ez<br/>
passin resolooehens iudoose enufi dissat­<br/>
isfied Republikins in the close Northern<br/>
States to vote with us to elect a Demo­<br/>
cratic President who will give us these<br/>
boous, we three are for passing these<br/>
resolooshens, no matter what tbey are.<br/>
This bein my understands uv Vallan­<br/>
dygum&#x27;s movement, I acted onto it to J<br/>
<br/>
wunst.<br/>
I got the leedin Diuocracy uv the<br/>
Corners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s.<br/>
That I mite get em all at one time, I<br/>
waited till the regler eveuing for the raid<br/>
on the niggers and Northern settlers up<br/>
towards Garrelstown, knowin that, on<br/>
I their return, they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s<br/>
for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin suc-<br/>
cessful in their hangin and burniu they&#x27;d<br/>
be in good humor, and ready to adopt<br/>
anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very<br/>
short but salUfactry coLsultasheu. There<br/>
wuz some objickshums on the part of a<br/>
few to what they called an abandonment<br/>
uv Diuiocratic ideas, but Bascom settled<br/>
their hash in very short metre. He re­<br/>
mark that it wuz necessary that the of­<br/>
fice be in the hands uv his friends lor ob­<br/>
vious reasons. He wanted pay and he<br/>
knowed uv no other way to git it. He<br/>
beleeved in the fullest freedom uv thought<br/>
and ackshen, and that every one should<br/>
<br/>
express himself untrampled, but helyoost to be, the iltegility uv the athendJ<br/>
<br/>
coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any<br/>
one iu that assemblage so stoopid ez to<br/>
differ with him on that question, let him<br/>
make himself known. No sicb man<br/>
shood ever git a drop at his bar, never ;<br/>
such a one wuz not deservin uv even the<br/>
commonest necessaries uv life. Several<br/>
who bad riz to their feet to object dropt<br/>
as. though they had been shot.<br/>
It wuz determined to hold a public<br/>
meetin tbe next nite at the church to<br/>
make a public endorsement of Vallandy­<br/>
gnra&#x27;s idees.<br/>
Es the prinsipal objict uv the meetin<br/>
waz to convins the Republikins uv the<br/>
doubtful States that the Democracy uv<br/>
the South really accepted the situashen,<br/>
and ment, in ded earnest to recognize<br/>
tbe great prinsipal uv equality, I arranged<br/>
to hev all the niggers uv the CoruerB<br/>
present and saved lor em tbe best seats<br/>
in the hou.&#x27;e. Joe Bigler and Pollock<br/>
cum uv course, which I coodent help.<br/>
I opened the exercises by makin a<br/>
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-<br/>
joist that the time hed fiually arrived<br/>
when the lion and lamb bed layed down<br/>
together, aud a child wuz the lead in uv<br/>
I knowed our colored fellow-citi- j<br/>
em<br/>
zeus hed bin despiteful! y voosed. and<br/>
and that due respect had not bin aliuz<br/>
paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North,,<br/>
but that time bed now passed, and<br/>
hoped forever. The Democrlsy uv the<br/>
North, through Vallandygum, hed spbk,<br/>
they bed accepted tbe situashen, balle­<br/>
loogy, and from this time henceforth and<br/>
forever there wuz nothin but peece t<br/>

Yoonited Stales recognize the legality j<br/>
nv all the amendments made to the Con- i<br/>
stitooshen dooring and sinee the late on­<br/>

most heartily acquiesce iu all the results<br/>
nv the war ; that they not only with<br/>
draw all thetr opposishen to yoouiversal<br/>
suffrage, hut pledge theirselves to see<br/>
that our Afrikio fellow-citizens hev notj<br/>
only this but all other rites heretofore<br/>
enjoyed excloosively by the Caacashen.&quot;<br/>
I put the question ez to the adopshen<br/>
dv the resolooshens, it wnz carried yoo­<br/>
nanimously. It would hew bid well hed<br/>
I stopped here, - but I didn&#x27;t. My , pre-<br/>
valin weekness is to slop over and I<br/>
slopt on this okkasion fearfully.&#x27; I call­<br/>

common kontry.”<br/>
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers<br/>
stepped forred, the whites designated<br/>
advanced, the two lines grasped each other<br/>
by the hand, and I was about to ware when<br/>
Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to wait a<br/>
minit till he had made his remark. The<br/>
site before him almost moved him to tears.<br/>
Ef ho hed ever harbored a suspishen that<br/>
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Ken­<br/>
tucky breast, he took it all back. The<br/>
aeshun uv to nito wuz not only Just but it<br/>
wuz generous.<br/>
“Generous!” said I, “whygenerous?”<br/>
“ Becoz,” said lie, “ the niggers wood be<br/>
in a devilish bad way ef you hedn’t deci­<br/>
ded on given era their rites uv your own<br/>
akkord, for there ain&#x27;t no power now that<br/>
can compel you to doit. Ijist got a North­<br/>
ern paper—alas ! the Rcpuhlikin party is<br/>
split into fragments, remarkably small<br/>
fragments. Grant assaulied Sumner in the<br/>
Capitol last Monday; Logan has been<br/>
stoned by the Rcpuhlikins uv Philadelfy<br/>
on his way home ; the Central Committees<br/>
of Ohio, Injeany and Illinois hev divided,<br/>
and each fraeshen has called a convcnshun,<br/>
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the<br/>
sponge and sez that nothin under hevin kin<br/>
prevent the success uv the Dimikratic can­<br/>
didate for the Presidency, no matter who<br/>
he may be or wot platform he is put onto.<br/>
In view of the dissolooshcn uv the Repub­<br/>
likin party, and the fact that the niggers<br/>
ain’t now got no protectors, its really gen­<br/>
erous that yoo ”<br/>
“ The Republikin party is gone to pieces,<br/>
hez it?” gasped my twenty-two white<br/>
friends in korious.<br/>
“ It hez,” responded Bigler.<br/>
“Then,” said Deekin Pogram, his eyes<br/>
flashing with unwontid fire, “what we’ve<br/>
done and sed don’t count 1 Take that, you<br/>
black cuss.”<br/>
And with a strength and activity wich I<br/>
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, tho Deekin<br/>
fecht the darkey whose hand he had been<br/>
graspin, a most powerful blow atween the<br/>
eyes, which histed him clean off the plat­<br/>
form. The others followed suit, aud in<br/>
their zeal sprung off the platform after era,<br/>
aud wuz a cxecutin war dances uv the most<br/>
frantic descripshen unto their prostrate<br/>
bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock<br/>
and Bigler restrained em from taken uv em<br/>
out and hangin uv em.<br/>
Ez matter uv course the resolooshcn wuz<br/>
recinded, and others adopted affirrain our<br/>
adherence to the Constitution ez it yoost<br/>
to be, the illegality uv the amendments,<br/>
and the natural soopremacy uv the white<br/>
man over the d—d uigger, after which wo<br/>
adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our custom,<br/>
and there organized fresh raids onto our<br/>
natural enemies.<br/>
The next moruiu I noticed a pecoolyer<br/>
look on Bigler’s face, likewise on Pollock’s.<br/>
They grinned at me as I passed with a<br/>
broadnis I coodent account for. Lubbock,<br/>
the nigger postmaster, bust into a roor as I<br/>
walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded<br/>
the reason of his hilarity.<br/>
“ Dat mistake oh Bigler’s,” returned he,<br/>
laughing louder than before.<br/>
“ What mistake ?” I asked, turning pale,<br/>
for suspicion was creepin over me.<br/>
“ Why, he didn’t get no paper at all,<br/>
and—”<br/>
“ And all that story about the split iu<br/>
the Rcpublikin party North wuz one uv his<br/>
infernal lies?”<br/>
“ Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de<br/>
&#x27;case 1” replied the nigger, showing his<br/>
ivories.<br/>
“ Bigler wanted too see ef your pentance<br/>
wuz genooine—dat’s all dah wuz ob it.—<br/>
He ’sprest desire to assortane jist how<br/>
peccable yood be to do nigger and do<br/>
Northern people down heah, ef da wuzn&#x27;t<br/>
Publikin party up North to hold yoo ; dat<br/>
wuz all.”<br/>
And the nigger laffed a fiendish laff.<br/>
That wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found<br/>
out all he wanted to. Uv coorse this<br/>
“outrage” as they will call it, will git into<br/>
the Northern papers, and uv coorse Vallan­<br/>
dygum’s assershun will explode without<br/>
hurting anybody. Joe Bigler is my evil<br/>
genius. I shel never be able to run things<br/>
ez I want to so long ez he lives.<br/>
