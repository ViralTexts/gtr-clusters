papers — it is neither honest nor  
independent. When thou dost enter into a  
printing office, have care to thyseif

SPECIE IN THE COUNTRY-TOTAL CIB-  
CULATION.  
  
At this time, when certain parties, from interested motives,  
persist in rang the present panic to a too great depletion of  
the precious metals from the currency, it becomes interesting to  
draw from official sources the real inovement of the metals.  
For this purpo-e we go back to the first records of their move-  
ment, which were commenced in )821. It w to be borne in  
mind that this country—whieh up to 1824 produced none of the  
precious metals, and from that time only in small quantities up  
to 1849—was obliged to depend entirely upon the sale of it« pro-  
duce to other countries fur a supply of those metals for orna-  
ment and use. To procure that supply it was necexsary that,  
whatever might be the apparend fiuctuations of commerce, it  
should in the long run be what is termed.‘ favorable.” Up to  
1821 there had been about $16,000,000 coined. but foreign coins  
were continued a legai tender up to within a few years. In  
1221 the banks held about $19,000,000. and Crawford, Gallatin,  
and others estimated that there was about 837,000,000, From  
  
that time up to 1849, when C gold was discovered, the  
movement was as follows:

 IN THE UNITED STATES,  
  
Various estimates are made from time to time of the quantity of specie in the  
country, and the mode of its distribution. Some are very wild in their results.  
The best means of approximation is to adhere to the official figures in relation  
to the precious metals. For this purpose, we go back to the first records of their  
movement, which were commenced in 1821. It is to be borne in mind that this  
country—which up to 1824 produced none of the precious metals, and from that  
time only in small quantities up to 1849-—was obliged to depend entirely upon  
the sale of its produce to other countries for a supply of those metals for orna-  
ment and use. To procure that supply, it was necessary that, whatever might  
be the apparent fluctuations of commerce, it should in the long run be what is  
called “ favorable.” Up to 1821, there had been about $16,000,000 coined, but  
foreign coins were continued a legal tender up to within a few years. In 1821,  
the banks held about $19,000,000, and Crawford, Gallatin, and others estimated  
that at that time there was about $37,000,000 in the country. From that time  
up to 1849, when California was discovered, the movement was as follows :—
