<br/>
The first operations were commenced on the western wall, at a point near what is known as Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It receives the name from the fact that it was first discovered by Captain Wilson, who had not the means, however, to prosecute any mining operations. Captain Warren&#x27;s explorations proved this arch to be one of a series forming a viaduct which led from the Temple toward the palace of Herod on the western hill, and constituting perhaps the very bridge across which Jesus was conducted from Pilate to Herod on the day of his trial. The remains of a winding aqueduct, cut in the solid rock beneath this bridge, were also discovered. Part of this bridge has fallen, and broken and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and the original pavement of the ancient road in the valley itself is forty-five feet below the present surface formed by the ruins of the ancient wall and houses. Nor is this all. A perfect net-work of subterranean chambers was also disclosed, some of which were probably used for the storage of food, and others as aqueducts and cisterns. And the whole result more than confirms the ideas of Jewish architectural grandeur which the books of the Bible and the pages of Josephus combined to give, but which have hitherto been regarded by many skeptical minds as apocryphal.<br/>
<br/>
Along the southern wall his discoveries were scarcely less interesting. Here he found a double pavement, one twenty-three, the other forty-three feet below the present surface of the ground. Here also he found some curious remains both of Hebrew and of Christian origin. The following description of his explorations at this point, taken from one of his letters written at the time, will afford the reader a more graphic picture of the difficulties and dangers which attended his investigations than can be given by any general description:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;On Friday, having arrived at a depth of seventy-nine feet, the men were breaking up a stone at the bottom of the shaft. Suddenly the ground gave way, down went the stone and the hammer, the men barely saving themselves. They at once rushed up, and told the sergeant they had found the bottomless pit. I went down to the spot and examined it; and, in order that you may have an idea of the extent of our work, I will give you a description of our descent.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The shaft mouth is on the south side of the Sanctuary wall, near the southwest angle, among the prickly-pears; beside it, to the east, lying against the Sanctuary wall, is a large mass of rubbish that has been brought up; while over the mouth itself is a triangular gin, with iron wheel attached, with guy, for running up the excavated soil. Looking down the shaft, one sees that it is lined for the first twenty feet with frames four feet six inches in the clear; further down the Sanctuary wall and soil cut through are seen, and a man standing at what appears to be the bottom. An order is given to this man, who repeats it, and then, faintly, is heard a sepulchral voice answering, as it were, from another world. Reaching down tot he man who is visible is a thirty-four-feet rope-latter; and, on descending by it, one finds he is standing on a ledge which the ladder does not touch by four feet. This ledge is a top of a wall running north and south, and abutting on she Sanctuary wall; its east face just cuts the centre of the shaft, which has to be canted off about two feet toward the east, just where some large loose stones jut out in the most disagreeable manner. Here five more frames have been fixed to keep these stones steady. On peering down from this ledge one sees the Sanctuary wall, with its projecting courses, until they are lost in the darkness below; observing also, at the same time, that two sides of the shaft are cut through the soil and are self-supporting. Now to descend this second drop the ladder is again required; accordingly, having told the man at the bottom to get under cover, it is lowered to the ledge, from whence it is found that it does not reach to the bottom by several feet. It is therefore lowered to the the required distance, and one has to reach it by climbing down hand over hand for about twelve feet. On passing alone one notes the marvelous joints of the Sanctuary wall stones, and also, probably, gets a few blows on skull and knuckles from falling pebbles. Just on reaching the bottom one recollects there is still a pit of unknown depth to be explored, and cautiously straddle across it. Then can be seen that one course in the Sanctuary wall, near the bottom, is quite smooth all over, the stone being finely dressed, around the drafts; one also sees two stout boards lying against the Santuary wall, under which the men retire whenever an accidental shower of stones renders their position dangerous. One is now at a depth of seventy-nine feet from the surface, and from here we commence the exploring of the &#x27;bottomless pit.&#x27; After dropping a rope down, we found that it was only six feet deep, though it looked black enough for any thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Further explorations disclosed a subterranean passage, perhaps orginally constructed to carry off the overflow from the Temple; and the intrepid investigator crawled on his hands and feet 400 feet along the slimy drain through the mud, the passage at times becoming so narrow that he could barely squeeze through, and the air so foul as to threaten suffocation. The difficulty of his position is indicated by the fact that he had to back out 200 feet before he could get to a point where he could turn his head.—From &quot;The Recovery of Jerusalem,&quot; by Lyman Abbott, in *Harper&#x27;s Magazine* for July.</td></tr></table></div><hr />

this 11th day of last October :—<br/>
<br/>
“The shaft-mouth is on the south side of the<br/>
Haram wall, near the south-west angle,” writes<br/>
Lieutenant Warren, “among the prickly pears.<br/>
Beside it, to the east, lying against the wall, is<br/>
a large mass of rubbish that has been..brought<br/>
up; while over the mouth of the shaft itself is<br/>
a triangular gin,.with.an iron wheel:attached,<br/>

lined for the first 20 feet with timber framing<br/>
4 feet 6 inches in the clear. Further down, :the<br/>
Haram wall is seen, and the soil which has been<br/>
cut through, and a man appears standing at what<br/>
apparently is the bottom., An order is,given) to<br/>
this man, who repeats. it, and then, a.sepulchral<br/>
voice is heard answering faintly, »as .if\:from<br/>
another world. . Reaching down,towards the man<br/>
who is visible is, a 84-feeb..nope-ladder; and on<br/>
descending by it, I find,that the: man, #g-standing<br/>

4 feet. This ‘eden . of the wall running<br/>
north and south, which abuts on, the. Haram. wall.<br/>
The east face of this.wall just cuts, the: centre.of<br/>
the shaft, whieh;,;consequently,..has «to; beveanted<br/>
off about 2 feet towards the east, just where some<br/>
large loose stones jut out in the most disagreeable<br/>
manner. Here five more of the timber frames<br/>
have been fixed to keep these stones steady. On<br/>
peering down from this ledge, the Haram wall is<br/>
discovered, and its grand projecting courses of<br/>
masonry become lost in the darkness still lower<br/>
down; and, at the same time, it becomes evident<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and are self-supporting. In order to descend thig<br/>
second stage of the shaft, the ladder is again re-<br/>
<br/>
quired. Accordingly, having told the man at the ~<br/>
<br/>
bottom to get under cover, the ladder is lowered<br/>
to the ledge, and then, since it does not reach the<br/>
bottom of the shaft, it has to be lowered about<br/>
twelve feet more, and I have to reach it by climb-<br/>
ing down by a rope hand over hand. As I pass<br/>
along, I observe the marvellous joints of the Haram<br/>
wall, and also probably encounter a few blows on<br/>
the head and knuckles from falling pebbles. At<br/>
last, on reaching the bottom of the ladder, I re.<br/>
member that there is still a pit of unknown depth<br/>
to be explored, and so I step cautiously over the<br/>
aperture leading to it. Then can be seen that one<br/>
course of the Haram wall, near its base, is quite<br/>
smooth all over, the stone being finely dressed, all<br/>
the other eourses being well dressed only round<br/>
their drafts (or sunk borders). Two stout boards<br/>
alsovare here seen lying against the Haram wall,<br/>
under which the men retire whenever an acci-<br/>
dental shower of stones renders their position<br/>
dangerous. I am now at the depth of seventy.<br/>
nine fect from the surface, and here I commence<br/>
my exploration, of the ‘ bottomless pit.’ Having<br/>
dropped a rope down into it, I&gt; discover that it<br/>
really is only six feet deep, though certainly it<br/>

Tlic Exploration* at Jerusalem.<br/>
The tirst operations were commenced on the<br/>
vestern wall, at a point near what is known as<br/>
Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It receives tho name from the<br/>
act that it was tirst discovered by Captain<br/>
Wilson, who had not the means, however, to<br/>
prosecute any mining operations. Captain<br/>
Warren&#x27;s explorations proved this arch to be<br/>
&gt;ne of a series forming a viaduct which led j<br/>
&#x27;rem the Temple toward the palace of Herod<br/>
&gt;n the western hillt and constituting perhaps<br/>
he very bridge across which Jesus was conluctcd<br/>
from Pilate to Ilerod on the day of his<br/>
rial. The remains of a winding aqueduct, cut,<br/>
n the solid rock beneath this bridge, were also !<br/>
li8oovered. Part of this bridge has fallen, and<br/>
iroken and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and<br/>
;he original pavement of the ancient road in<br/>
:he valley itself is forty-five feet below the pres<br/>
;nt surface formed by the ruins of the ancieut<br/>
ivalls and bouses. Nor is this all. A perfect<br/>
jet-work of subterranean chambers was also<br/>
iisclosed, some of which were probably used<br/>
&quot;or the storage of food, and others as aqueducts<br/>
irid cisterns. And the whole result more than ,<br/>
;onfirms the ideas of Jewish architectural<br/>
grandeur which the books of the Bible and the<br/>
jages of Josephus combined to give, but which i<br/>
jave hitherto been regarded by many skeptical<br/>
liinds as apocryphal.<br/>
Along the southern wall his discoveries were :<br/>
jcarcely less interesting. Here he found a<br/>
loukle pavement, one tweuty-three, the other &#x27;<br/>
&#x27;orty-three feet below the present surface of<br/>
the ground. Here also he found some curious<br/>
<br/>
remains both of Hebrew and of Christian origin. :<br/>
1&#x27;he following description of bis explorations at<br/>
:his point, takeu from one of his letters writeu<br/>
at the time, will afford the reader a more<br/>
graphic picture of the difficulties and dangers<br/>
which attended his investigations than can be<br/>
$iven by any general description :<br/>
&quot; Ou Friday, having arrived at a depth of!&#x27;<br/>
leventy-nine feet, the uien were breaking up a :<br/>
itoue at the bottom of the shaft. Suddenly the<br/>
ground gave way, down went the stone and the<br/>
maimer, the men barely saving themselves,<br/>
fhey at once rushedjup, and told the sergeant<br/>
hey had found the bottomless pit. I went<br/>
iown to the spot and examined it; and, in orier<br/>
that you may have an idea of the extent of<br/>
)ur work, 1 will give you a description of our<br/>
lescent.<br/>
44 The shaft mouth is on the south side of<br/>
.he Sanctuary wall, near the southwest angle,<br/>
unong the prickly pears; beside it, to the east,<br/>
lying against the Sanctuary wall, is a large<br/>
mass of rubbish that has been brought up ;<br/>
while over the tuouth itself is a triangular gin,<br/>
with iron wheel attached, with guy, for running<br/>
ip the excavated soil. Looking down the shaft,<br/>
one sees that it is lined for the first twenty feet i<br/>
with frames four feet six inches in the clear ; i<br/>
further down the Sanctuary wall and soil cut<br/>
through are seen, and a man standing at what<br/>
ippeurs to be the bottom. An order is given ;<br/>
to this man, who repeats it, and then, faintly,<br/>
is heard a sepulchral voice answering, as it<br/>
were, from another world. Reachiug down to<br/>
the man who is visible is a thirty-four feet t opeladder<br/>
; and, on descending by it,|one finds he is<br/>
itanding ou a ledge which the ladder does not<br/>
touch by four feet. This ledge is a top of a<br/>
wall running north and south, and abutting on<br/>
*he Sanctuary wall ; its east face just cuts the<br/>
:cntre of the shaft, which has to be canted off j<br/>
sbout two feet toward the east, just where some I<br/>
large loose stones jut out in the most disagreeable<br/>
manner, liere five more frames have been<br/>
Qxed to keep these stones steady. On peering<br/>
iown from this ledge one sees the Sanctuary<br/>

the same time, that two sides of the shaft are<br/>
cut through the soil,aand are self-surpporting.<br/>
Now to descend this second drop the ladder is<br/>
again required; accordingly, having told the<br/>
man at the bottom to get under cover, it is<br/>
lowered to the Ledge, from whence it is found<br/>
that it does not reach to the l&gt;ottom by several<br/>
feet. It is therefore lowered to the required<br/>
distance, and one has to reach it by climbing<br/>
doavn hand over hand for about twelve feet.<br/>
On passing along one notes the marvelous joints<br/>
of the Sanctuary wail stones, and also, probably,<br/>
getsja few blows on skull aud knuckles<br/>
from falling pebbles. Just on reaching the<br/>
bottom one recdlleots there is still a pit of nakuown<br/>

ations. Captain Warren&#x27;s explorations<br/>
proved this arch to be one of a series<br/>
forming a viaduct which led from the<br/>
Temple toward the palace of Herod, on<br/>
the western hill, and constituting perhaps<br/>
the very bridge across which Jesus was<br/>
conducted from Pilate to Herod on the<br/>
day of his trial. The remains of a wind­<br/>
ing aqueduct, cut in the solid rock be­<br/>
neath the bridge, were also discovered.<br/>
Part of the bridge has fallen and broken<br/>
and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and<br/>
the original pavement of the ancient<br/>
road in the valley itself is now forty-five<br/>
feet below the present surface formed by<br/>
the ruins of ancient walls. A perfect<br/>
network of subterranean chambers was<br/>
also disclosed, some of which were pro­<br/>
bably used for the storage of food, and<br/>
others as aqueducts and cisterns. Along<br/>
the southern wall Captain Warren found<br/>
a double pavement, one twenty-three, the<br/>
other forty-three feet below the present<br/>
surface of the ground. Here he also<br/>
found some curious remains both of He­<br/>
brew and Christian origin.<br/>
At a depth of seventy-nine feet from<br/>
the present surface he commenced the ex­<br/>
ploration of what was called the bottom­<br/>
less pit, which, upon investigation, was<br/>
found to be six feet deep. Upon entering<br/>
it there was disclosed a subterranean pas­<br/>
sage, perhaps originally constructed to<br/>
carry off the overflow from the temple,<br/>
and the intrepid investigator crawled on<br/>
his hands and feet four hundred feet<br/>
along this slimy drain through the mud,<br/>
the passage, at times, becoming so narrow<br/>
that he could barely squeeze through, and<br/>
the air so foul as to threaten suftocation.<br/>

The Exploration of Jerusalem.<br/>
Tho first operations wero commcnccd on<br/>
tho western wall, at a point near what is<br/>
known as Wilson&#x27;s Arch. It receives this<br/>
name from the fact that it was first discov­<br/>
ered by Captain Wilson, who liad not tho<br/>
means, however, to jimsocutc any mining<br/>
operations. Captain Warren&#x27;s explora­<br/>
tion proved this arch to bo one of a scries<br/>
forming a viaduct which led from the<br/>
Temple toward tho palace of Herod on tho<br/>
western hill, and constituting perhaps tho<br/>
very bridge across which Jesus was con­<br/>
ducted from l&#x27;ilate to Herod on the day of<br/>
his trial. Tho remains of a winding aq­<br/>
ueduct, cut in tho solid rock beneath this<br/>
singular bridgo, wero also discovered.?<br/>
l&#x27;art of this bridgo has fallen, and broken<br/>
aud buried the aqueduct iu its fall; and the<br/>
original pavement of tho ancieut road in<br/>
the valley itself is now forty-fivo feet bo­<br/>
low the present surface formed by the ru­<br/>
ins of the anoicnt walls and houses. Nor<br/>
is this all. A perfect net-work of subter­<br/>
ranean chambers was also disclosed, somo<br/>
of which were probably used for^ho stor­<br/>
age of food, and others as nqucducts and<br/>
cistcrns. And tho whole result more than<br/>
confirms tho ideas of architectural gran­<br/>
deur which the books of the Iliblo and tho<br/>
pages of Joscphus combined to givo, but<br/>
which have hitherto been regarded by ma­<br/>
ny skeptical minds as apocryphal.<br/>
Along the southern wall his discoveries<br/>
wero scarcely less interesting. Here ho<br/>
found a double pavement, one twenty-three<br/>
aud the other forty-thrca foot below tho<br/>
present surface of the ground. Iloro also<br/>
ho found somo curious remains both Of He­<br/>
brew and of Christian origin. Tho fol­<br/>
lowing description of his explorations at<br/>
this point, taken from ono of his letters<br/>
written at the time, will afford tho reader<br/>
a more graphic picturo of tho difficulties<br/>
and danger which attended his investiga­<br/>
tions than can bo given by any general<br/>
description:<br/>
&quot;On Friday, have arrived at a depth of<br/>
seventy-nino feet, tiic men wero breaking<br/>
up a stone at tho bottom of tho shaft.?<br/>
Suddenly the ground gavo way, down<br/>
went tho stone and tho hammer, tlio men<br/>
barely saving themselves. They at once<br/>
bjr<br/>
found tho bottomless pit. I wcut down to<br/>
the spot and examined it; and, in order<br/>
that you may have an idea of tho extent of<br/>
our woik, I will give you a description of<br/>
our descent.<br/>
&#x27;The shaft mouth is on the south-sido<br/>
of the Guticlnary wall, near tho southwest<br/>
angle, among tho prickly-pears; besido it,<br/>
to the cast, lving against tho Sanctuary I<br/>
wall, is a largo mass of rubbish that has<br/>
been brought up; while over the mouth it­<br/>
self is a triangular gin, with iron-wheel at­<br/>
tached, with guy, for running up tho ex­<br/>
cavated soil. Looking down tho shaft, ono<br/>
sees that it is lined for tho first twenty<br/>
feet with frames four feet six inohes in tho<br/>
clcar; further down tho Sanctuary wall and<br/>
soil cut through arc seen, and a man stand­<br/>
ing at the bottom. An order is given to<br/>
this man, who repeats it, and then faintly,<br/>
is heard a sepulchral voice answering, as<br/>
it were from another world, ltcnching<br/>
down to the man who is visible is a thirty­<br/>
four feet rope Jaddcr; aud on descending<br/>
by it, ono finds he is standing on a ledge<br/>
which the ladder does not touch by four<br/>
feet. This ledge is tho top of a wall run­<br/>
ning north and south, and abutting on tho<br/>
Sanctuary wall; its east face just cuts the<br/>
centre of tho shaft, which has to bo canted<br/>
oil about two feet toward the cast, just<br/>
where some large looso stones jut out in<br/>
the most disagreoablo manner. Hero five<br/>
more frames have been fixed to keep these<br/>
stones steady. On peering down from this<br/>
ledge one sees tho Sanctuary wall, with its<br/>
projecting courses, until they are lost in<br/>
the darkness below; observing also, at tho<br/>
same time, that two sides of the shaft arc<br/>
cut through the soil, and aro self-support­<br/>
ing. Now to deseend this second drop<br/>
the ladder is again required; accordingly<br/>
having told the man at the bottom to get<br/>
under cover, it is lowered to tho ledge,<br/>
from whenco it is found that it docs not<br/>
rcach to tho bottom by several feet. It is<br/>
therefore lowered to tho required distance,<br/>
and ono has to reach it by climbiug down<br/>
hand over hand for about twelve feet. On<br/>
passing along ono notices tho marvelous<br/>
joints of tie Sanctuary wall stones, and<br/>
also, probably, gets a few blows on skull<br/>
and knuckles from falling pebbles. Just<br/>
on reaching the bottom one recollects there<br/>
is still a pit of unknown depth to bo ex­<br/>
plored, and cautiously straddles across it.<br/>
Then can be seen that one courso in the<br/>
Sanctuary wull, ucar the bottom, is quite<br/>
smooth all over, tho stone being finely<br/>
dressed, all other courses being only well<br/>
dressed around the drafts; one aliio uccu two<br/>
<br/>
| stout boards lying against l&#x27;10 Sanctuary<br/>
wall, under wbioh the men rotiro whenev­<br/>
er an accidental shower of stonoa rendu ra<br/>
their position dangerous. Ono is now at<br/>
the dopth of scventy-niuo foot from the<br/>
surface, and from hero wo ooimnonoo<br/>
tho explorations of tho &quot;bottomless<br/>
pit.&quot; After dropping a ropo down, wo<br/>
found that it was only six feet deep, though<br/>
it looked black enough for anything.<br/>
Further exploration disoloscd a subter­<br/>
ranean passago, porhap.i originally con­<br/>
structed to carry off tho overflow from &#x27;he<br/>

along this slimy drain through tho mud,<br/>
tho passage at times becoming so narrow<br/>
that ho could barely squoeu through, and<br/>

Tho difficulty of his position is indicated<br/>
by the fact that ho had to back -00 &#x27;feet<br/>

I could turn his head round.?1&#x27; rom &quot;1 ho<br/>
