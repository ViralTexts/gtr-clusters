Dear Sir,  
Passy, March 31. 1784  
  
The Ratification of the Definitive Treaty is arrived, and we have written to Mr Hartley that we are ready to exchange with him whenever it is convenient to him. Enclos’d you have Copies of the Recommendatory Resolution, Proclamation, &amp; President’s Letter. We imagine Mr Hartley has an Inclination to come hither on the Occasion. Perhaps we are mistaken, and that he would as willingly make the Exchange there. In that Case, as a Duplicate is sent via London, by Major Franks, who probably is arriv’d by this time, and may have delivered it to you, it will be very agreable to us, if you, who are equally impowered, should finish the Business. With great and sincere Esteem, I am, dear Sir, Your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant  
  
B. Franklin  
His Excelly. Henry Laurens Esqr

We have now the Pleasure of acquainting you, that the Ratification of the  
Definitive Treaty is arrived here by an Express from Congress. You have  
already been informed that the Severity of the winter in America, which hin-  
dred Travelling, had occasion’d a Delay in the assembling of the States. As  
soon as a sufficient number were got together, the Treaty was taken into Con-  
sideration, and the Ratification pass’d unanimously. Inclos’d you have copies  
of the Proclamation issued on the occasion, and of the recommendatory Reso-  
lution. The Messenger was detained at New York near a Month, by the Ice  
which prevented the ‘Packet-Boat’s sailing, otherwise he would probably have  
been here in February. We are now ready to exchange the Ratifications with  
you, whenever it shall be convenient to you. With great and sincere Esteem,  
  
  
  
we have the Honour to be,  
Sir,
