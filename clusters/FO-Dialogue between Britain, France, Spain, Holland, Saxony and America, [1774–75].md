It has been demonstrated that Franklin did not, as William Temple Franklin asserted and subsequent editors believed, write this dialogue shortly after arriving in France in 1776, but shortly before leaving England in 1775. If he began it considerably earlier, as seems likely, it must have been in a quite different vein; for he clearly finished it at a time when hostilities were imminent. He did not provide any clues, however, for establishing the precise date.  
  
[1774–75]  
A Dialogue between Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Saxony and America.  
  
Britain  
Sister of Spain, I have a Favour to ask of you. My Subjects in America are disobedient, and I am about to chastize them. I beg you will not furnish them with any Arms or Ammunition.  
  
Spain  
Have you forgotten, then, that when my Subjects in the Low Countries rebelled against me, you not only furnished them with military Stores, but join’d them with an Army and a Fleet? I wonder how you can have the Impudence to ask such a Favour of me, or the Folly to expect it!  
  
Britain  
You my dear Sister of France will surely not refuse me this Favour.  
  
France  
Did you not assist my Rebel Hugenots with a Fleet and an Army at Rochelle? And have you not lately aided privately and sneakingly my Rebel Subjects in Corsica? And do you not at this Instant keep their Chief pension’d, and ready to head a fresh Revolt there, whenever you can find or make an Opportunity? Dear Sister you must be a little silly!  
  
Britain  
Honest Holland! You see it is remembered that I was once your Friend, You will therefore be mine on this Occasion. I know indeed you are accustom’d to smuggle with these Rebels of mine. I will wink at that, Sell ’em as much Tea as you please to enervate the Rascals; since they will not take it of me; but for Gods sake dont supply them with any Arms.  
  
Holland  
’Tis true you assisted me against Philip, my Tyrant of Spain but have I not since assisted you against one of your Tyrants, and enabled you to expell him? Surely that Accompt, as we Merchants say, is Ballanc’d, and I am nothing in your Debt. I have indeed some Complaints against you, for endeavouring to starve me by your Navigation Acts: But being peaceably dispos’d I do not quarrel with you for that. I shall only go on quietly with my own Business. Trade is my Profession, ’tis all I have to subsist on. And let me tell you, I should make no scruple, (on the prospect of a good Market for that Commodity,) even to send my Ships to Hell and supply the Devil with Brimstone. For you must know I can insure in London against the Burning of my Sails.  
  
America to Britain.  
Why you old blood thirsty Bully! you who have been everywhere vaunting your own Prowess, and defaming the Americans as Poltroons! you who have boasted of being able to march over all their Bellies with a single Regiment! You who by Fraud have possess’d yourself of their strongest Fortress, and all the Arms they had stor’d up in it! You who have a disciplin’d Army in their Country intrench’d to the Teeth and provided with every thing! Do you run about begging all Europe not to supply those poor People with a little Powder and Shot? Do you mean, then, to fall upon them naked and unarm’d, and butcher them in cold Blood? Is this your Courage? Is this your Magnanimity?  
  
Britain.  
O! you wicked-Whig-Presbyterian-Serpent! Have you the Impudence to appear before me after all your Disobedience? Surrender immediatly all your Liberties and Properties into my Hands, or I will cut you to Pieces. Was it for this that I planted your Country at so great an Expence? that I protected you in your Infancy, and defended you against all your Enemies?  
  
America.  
I shall not surrender my Liberty and Property but with my Life. It is not true that my Country was planted at your Expence. Your own Records refute that Falshood to your Face. Nor did you ever afford me a Man or a shilling to defend me against the Indians, the only Enemies I had upon my own Account. But when you have quarrell’d with all Europe, and drawn me with you into all your Broils, then you value yourself upon protecting me from the Enemies you have made for me. I have no natural Cause of Difference with Spain, France, or Holland; and yet by turns I have join’d with you in Wars against them all. You would not suffer me to make or keep a seperate Peace with any of them, ’tho I might easily have done it, to great Advantage. Does your protecting me in those Wars give you a Right to fleece me? If so, as I fought for you, as well as you for me, it gives me a proportionable Right to fleece you. What think you of an American Law to make a Monopoly of You and your Commerce, as you have done by your Laws of me and mine? Content yourself with that Monopoly if you are Wise, and learn Justice if you would be respected!  
  
Britain  
You impudent B-h! am not I your Mother Country? Is not that a sufficient Title to your Respect and Obedience?  
  
Saxony.  
Mother Country! Hah, hah, he! What Respect have you the front to claim as a Mother Country? You know that I am your Mother Country, and yet you pay me none. Nay, it is but the other Day, since you hired Ruffians to rob me on the Highway, and burn my House! For shame! Hide your Face and hold your Tongue. If you continue this Conduct you will make yourself the Contempt of all Europe!  
  
Britain  
O Lord! where are my Friends!  
  
France Spain Holland and Saxony all together  
Friends! Believe us you have none, nor ever will have any ’till you mend your Manners. How can we who are your Neighbours have any Regard for You, or expect any Equity from You, should your Power increase, when we see how basely and unjustly you have us’d both your own Mother and your own Children?

A Dialogue between Britain, France,  
  
Spain, Holland, Saxony end America.  
  
Britain. Sister of Spain, I have a  
favor to ask of you. My subjects in  
America are disobedient, and I am  
about to chastise them; I beg you will  
not furnish them with any arms or am-  
munition.  
  
Spain. Have you forgotten, then,  
that when my subjects in the low coun-  
tries rebelled against me, you not only  
furnished them with military stores, but  
joined them with an army and a fleet?  
I wonder how you can have the impu-  
dence to ask such a favor of me, or the  
folly to expect it.  
  
Britain. You, my dear sister of  
F’ vance, will surely not refuse me this  
favor.  
  
France. Did you not assist my rebel  
Huguenots with a fleet and an army at  
Rochelle? And have you not lately aid-  
ed privately and sneakingly my rebel  
  
subjects in Corsica? And do you not at  
this instant keep their chief,—pension-  
ed, and ready to head a fresh revolt  
there, whenever you can find or make  
an opportunity? Dear sister, you must  
be a little silly!  
  
Briain. Honest Holland! You see  
it is remembered that I was once your  
friend; you will therefore be mine on  
this occasion. I know indeed you are  
accustomed to smuggle with these reb-  
els of mine. [I will wink at that; sell  
them as much tea as you please to en-  
ervate the rascals, since they will not  
take itof me; but for God’s sake don’t  
supply them with any arms.  
  
Holland. ’Tis true you assisted me  
against Philip, my tyrant of Spain, but  
have I not since assisted you against  
one of your tyrants; and enabled you  
to expel him? Surely that accompt, as  
we merchants say, is balanced, and I  
am nothing in yourdebt. Ihave in-  
deed some complaints against you, for  
endeavoring to starve me by your navi-  
gation acts; but being peaceably dispos-

tell you, I should make no seruple, (on  
the prospect of a good market for that  
commodity) even to send my ships to  
Heli and supply the devil with brim-  
stone. For you must know, I can in-  
sure in London against the burning of  
my sails.  
  
America to Britain. Why, you old  
bloud-thirsty bully! you who have been  
everywhere vaunting your own prow-  
ess, and defaming the Americans as  
poltroons! you who have boasted of be-  
ing able to march over all their bellies  
with a single regiment! you who by  
fraud have possessed yourself of their  
strongest fortress, and all the arms they  
had stored up in it! you who have a dis-  
ciplined army in their country, in-  
trenched to the teeth, and provided  
with every thing! Do you run about  
begging all Europe not to supply those  
poor people with a little powder and  
shot? Do you mean, then, to fall upon  
them naked and unarmed, and butcher  
them in cold blood? Is this your cour-  
age? Is this your magnanimity?  
  
Britain. Oh! you wicked—W hig—  
Presbyterian—Serpent! Have you the  
impudence to appear before me after  
all your disobedience? Surrender im-  
mediately all your liberties and proper-  
ties into my hands, or I will cut you ta  
pieces. Was it for this that I planted  
your country at so great an expense?  
  
That I protected you in your infancy, .  
  
and defended you against all your ene-  
mies?  
  
America. I shall not surrender my  
liberty and property but with my life.  
It is pot true that my country was  
planted at your expense. Your owit  
records refute that falsehood to your  
face. Nor did you ever afford mea  
man or a shilling to defend me against  
the Indians, tae only enemies I had up-  
on my own account. But when you  
have quarrelled with all Europe, and  
drawn me with you into all your broils,  
then you value yourself upon protect-  
ing me from the enemies you haye made  
for me. I have no natural cause of  
difference with Spain, France, or Hol-  
land, and yet by turnsI have joined  
with you in wars against them all. You  
would not suffer me to make or keep a  
separate peace with any of them,  
though I might easily have done it, to  
great advantage. Does your protect-  
ing me in those wars give you a right  
*o fleece me? If so, as I fought for you,  
  
Notoria.  
  
  
  
341  
  
as well as you for me, it gives me a  
proportionable right to fleece you.  
What think you of an American law  
to make a monopoly of you and your  
commerce, as you have done by your  
laws of me and mine? Content your-  
self with that monopoly if you are wise,  
and learn justice if you would be res-  
pected.  
  
Britain. You impudent b h! am  
not I your mother country? Is not that  
a sufficient title to your respect and  
obedience?  
  
Saxony. .Mother country! Hah, hah,  
hah! What respect have you the front  
to claim as a mother country? You  
know that J am your mother country,  
and yet you pay me none. Nay, it is  
but the other day, that you hired ruf-  
fians to rob me on the highway, and  
burn my house! For shame! Hide your  
face and hold your tongue. If you  
continue this conduct you will make  
yourself the contempt of Europe!  
  
Britain. O Lord! where are my  
friends?  
  
France, Spain, Holland, and Saxe-  
ny, altogether. Friends! Believe us you  
have none, nor ever will have any till  
you mend your manners. How can  
we, who are your neighbours, have  
any regard for you, or expect any equi-  
ty from you, should your power in-  
crease, when we see how basely and  
unjustly you have used both your own  
mother and your own children.
