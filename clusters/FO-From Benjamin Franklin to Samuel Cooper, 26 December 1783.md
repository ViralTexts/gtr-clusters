I have received your Favour of the 16th October, and am much oblig’d by the Intelligence it contains.— I am happy to hear that your Government has agreed to furnish Congress with the Means of discharging the National Debt. The Obstruction that Measure met with in some of the States, has had very mischievous Effects on this side the Water; it discourag’d the Loan going on in Holland, and thereby occasion’d a Protest of some of Mr Morris’s Bills. Nothing can recover our Credit in Europe &amp; our Reputation in its Courts, but an immediate Proof of our Honesty &amp; Prudence by a general Provision in all the States for the punctual Payment of the Interest &amp; the final regular Discharge of the Principal. I hope we shall never deserve, nor any longer appear likely to deserve the Reproof given to an Enthusiastical Knave in Pennsylvania, who being call’d upon for an old Debt, said to his Creditor, Thou must have a little more Patience: I am not able yet to pay thee. Give me then your Bond, says the Creditor, &amp; pay me Interest. No, I cannot do that; I cannot in Conscience either receive or pay Interest, it is against my Principle. You have then the Conscience of a Rogue, says the Creditor: you tell me it is against your Principle to pay Interest;  
  
and it being against your Interest to pay the Principal, I perceive you do not intend to pay me either one or t’other—

“* Passy, Decr. 26th, 1783.  
  
“ Dear Sir: [have received your favour of  
the 16th October, and am much obliged by  
the intelligence it contains. I am happy to  
hear that your Government has agreed to  
furnish Congress with the means of discharg-  
ing the National Debt. The obstruction that  
measure met with in some of the States has  
had very mischievous effects on this side the  
water ; it discouraged the loan going on in  
Holland, and thereby occasioned a protest of  
some of Mr. Morris’s Bills. Nothing can re-  
cover our credit in Europe and our Reputation  
in its Courts, but an immediate proof of our  
honesty and prudence by a general provision  
in all the States for the punctual payment of  
the Interest and the final regular discharge  
of the Principal. I hope we shall never de-  
serve, nor any longer appear likely to deserve  
the reproof given to an enthusiastical knave  
in Pennsylvania, who being called upon for an  
old debt, said to. his creditor, Zhou must havea  
little more patience: Iam not able yet to pa  
thee. Give me then your bond, says the Cred-  
itor, and pay me interest. Vo, /cannot do that;  
  
  
  
UNPUBLISHED LETTERS OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.  
  
IT cannot in conscience either receive or pay in-  
terest, it is against my principle. You have the  
conscience of a rogue, says the creditor: You  
tell me it is against your principal to pay in-  
terest; and it being against your interest to  
pay the principal, I perceive you do not intend  
to pay me either one or t’other.
