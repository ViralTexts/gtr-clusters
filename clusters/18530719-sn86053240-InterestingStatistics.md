INTERESTING STATISTICS.  
  
A gentleman who keeps the run of facts, figures, and babies, has just laid before &quot;an inquiring world&quot; the following statistics:  
  
The whole number of languages spoken in the world amount to 3,064; viz., 587 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.—The inhabitants of our globe profess more than 1,000 different religions. The number of men is about equal to the number of women. The average of human life is about 33 years. One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years, one half before reaching 17 years of age, and those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) refused to one half the human species. To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100 years of age; to every 100, only six reach the age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of age.   
  
There are on the earth, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333 die every year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every hour, 60 every minute, or 1 every second. These losses are about balanced by an equal number of births. The married are longer lived than single, and, above all, those who observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall men live longer than short ones! Women have more chances of life in their favor previous to being 50 years of age than men, but fewer afterwards.  
  
The number of marriages is in proportion of 175 to 1,000 individuals. Marriages are more frequent after the equinoxes—that is during the months of June and December. Those born in the spring are generally more robust than others. Births and deaths are more frequent by night than by day. The number of men capable of working or bearing arms, is calculated at one-fourth of the population.  
  
Some of these statements are rather singular, and yet many of them are susceptible of an easy solution. That marriages take place more frequently in June and December, than other months of the year, was just what we have always suspected was the case. Those who marry in June, do so because they can&#x27;t help it; while those who connubialize in December, do so doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows which distinguish the frost-bitten months of winter. Those matches which come off in June are commonly love-matches, and are brought about by green fields, and the contagious influence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while those which happen in December are brought about in a great degree by mixing plain mathematics with the market value of flannel undergarments.

Interesting Statisties.  
A gentleman claiming to be a &quot;friend  
to the human race,&quot; and who keeps the  
run of facts, figures, and babies, has  
just laid before &quot;an enquiring world&quot;  
the following statistics:  
&quot;The whole number of languages  
oken in the world amount to 3,064;  
587 in Europe, 936 in Asia, 276 in Af­  
rica, and 1,264 in America. The inhab­  
itants of our globe profess more than  
1,000 different religions. The number  
of men is about equal to the number of  
women. The average of human life is  
about 33 years. One quarter part die  
previous to the age of? years; one-half  
before reaching I? years of age; and  
those who pass this age enjoy a felicity  
refused to one-half the human specics.  
To every 1000 persons only I reaches  
100 years of life; to every 100 only 6  
reach the age of 66, and not more than  
I in 500 reaches the age of 80. There  
are on the earth 1,000,000,000 inhabit­  
ants, and of these 333,333,333 die every  
year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every  
hour, 60 every minnte, or I every see­  
ond. These losses are about balanced by  
an equal number of births. The mar­  
ried are longer lived than the single,  
and, above all, those who observe a so­  
ber and industrious conduct. Tall men  
live longer than short ones. Women  
have more chances of life in their favor  
previous to being 50 years of age, than  
than men have, but fewer afterwards.  
The number of marriages is in propor-  
tion of 175 to every 1000 individuals.  
Marriages are more frequent after the  
equinoxes; that is, during the month  
of June and December. Those born in  
the spring are generally more robust  
than others. Births and deaths are  
more frequent by night than by day  
The number of men capable of bearing  
arms is estimated at one fourth of the  
population.&quot;  
Some of these statements are rather  
singular, and yet many of them are sus­  
ceptible of an easy solution. That mar­  
riages take place more frequently in  
June and December than any other  
months in the year, was just what we  
always suspected was the case. Those  
who marry in June do so because they­  
cant help its while thoe who connnbe  
in December, do so, doubtless, to  
guard against the chilly pillows which  
distinguish the frost-bitten months of  
winter. The matches which come off  
in June are commonly love matches,  
and are brought about by green fields,  
 and the contagious influence of bobo.­

 which happen in December are brought  
about, in a great degree, by mixing plain  
mathematics with the market value of  
 flannel under-garments.

interesting Statistics.  
A gentleman who keeps the run of  
facts, figures, and babies, has just  
laid before &quot;an inquiring world,&quot;  
the following statistics:  
The whole number of languages  
spoken in the world amonnt to 3,064;  
viz, 537 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276  
in Africa, and 1,264 in America.­  
The inhabitants of our globe profess  
more than 1,000 different religione.  
The number of men is about equal to  
the number of women. The average  
of human life is about 33 years. One  
fourth die previous to the age of7  
years, one half before reaching I  
years of age, and those who pass that  
age enjoy a felicity (7) refused to  
one half the human species. To eve­  
ry 1,000 persons only one reaches  
100 years of age; to every 100, only  
six reach the age of 66, and not more  
than one in 500 live to 80 years of  
age.  
There are on the earth, 1,000,000,­  
000 of inhabitants, and of these 323,  
333,333 die every year, 91,324 eve.­  
ry day, 3,730 every hour, 60 every  
minute, or I every second. These  
losses are about balanced by an equal  
number of births. The married are  
longer lived than single, and, above  
all, those who observe a sober and in­  
dustrious conduct. Tall men live  
longer than short ones! Women  
have more chances of life in their fae­  
vor previons to being 50 years of age  
than men, but fewer afterwards.  
The humber of marriages is in  
proportion of 175 to 1,000,individu.  
als. Marriages are more frequent  
after the equinoxes,-that is during  
the months of June and December.  
Those born in the spring are general  
ly more robust than others.Births  
and death are more frequent by night  
than by day. The number of men  
capable of working or bearing arms,  
is calculated at one-fourth of the pop­  
ulation.  
Some of these statements are rath­  
er singular, and yet many of them  
are susceptable of an easy solution.  
That marriages take place more fre­  
quently in June and December, than  
other months of the year, was just  
what we have always suspected was  
the case. Those who marry in June,  
do so because they can&#x27;t help it;  
while those who connubialize in De  
cemher, do so doubtless, to guard  
against the chilly pillows which dis.­  
tinguish the frostbitten months of  
winter. The matches which come  
off in June are commonly love  
matches, and are brought about by  
green fields, and the contagious in­  
fluence of bobolinks and yellow birds;  
while those which happen in Decem­  
ber are brought about in a great de­  
gree by mixing plain mathematics  
with the market value of flannel une­  
dergarments.

I nteresting S tatistics .—A gentleman who  
keeps the run of facts figures and babies, says  
the N. Y. Dutchman, has just laid before &quot;an  
inquiring world &quot; the following statistics :  
The whole number of languages spoken in  
the world amount to 30G4&gt; viz ; 686 in Europe,  
937 in Asia, 275&#x27; in Africa, and 1364 in America.

not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of

tant, and of these 333,333,333 die every year,

Interesting Statistics.  
  
A gentleman who keeps the run of facts,  
figures and babies, has just laid before &quot;an  
enquiring world&quot; the following statistics :  
The whole number of languages spoken in  
the world amount. to 3,064 ; 587 in Europe,  
0:16 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in  
America. The inhabitants of our globe  
profess more than 1,000 different religions.  
The number of men is about equal to the  
number of women. The average of human  
life is about :33 years. One quarter part  
die previous to the age of 7 years ; one half  
reaching 17 years of age, and those who  
pass this age enjoy a felicity refused to one  
half the human species. To every 1000  
persons only one reaches 100 years of life,  
to every one hundred only six reaches the  
age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live  
to 80 years of age.  
There are on the earth 1.000,000;0(X) of  
inhabitants, and of these :3:13,333,333 die  
every year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every  
hour, 60 every minute or one every second.  
These losses are about balanced by an equal  
number of births. The married are longer  
lived than the single, and above all, those  
who observe a sober and industrious con­  
duct. Tall men live longer than short ones.  
Women have more chances of life in their  
favor previous to&#x27;being 50 years of age than  
men have, but fewer afterwards. The  
number of Marriages is in proportion of 175  
to every 1,000 individuals. Marriages are  
more frequent after the esquinoxes ; that is,  
(luring the months of June and December.  
Those born in the spring tire generally more  
robust than others, Births and deaths are  
most frequent by night than by day. The  
number of men capable of working or bear­  
ing arms is calculated at one fourth of the  
population.  
Some of those statements are rather sin­  
gular, and yet many of them are susceptible  
of an easy solution. That marriages ,take  
place wore frequently in June and Decem­  
ber. than any other months of the year,  
was just what we have always suspected  
was the case. Those who marry in June,  
do so because they can&#x27;t help it while  
those who conubialize in December; do so,  
doubtless, to guard . against the chilly pil­  
lows whit:l distinguish the frostbitten months  
of winter. The matches which coma oft  
in June, re commonly Jove matches, and  
are briatiyi.t about by green fields, and the  
contagiuot ,  
.influence of bobolinks and yellow  
birds ; et de those which happen in De­  
cember, uro brought about, in a great de­  
gree, by nilxing plain mathematics with the  
market value of flannel under gaiwnents.—

ing Statistics.—A gentleman who keeps  
the run of facts, figures and fables, has  
just I Rid before “an enquiring world” the  
following statistics:  
The whole number of languages spoken  
in the world amount to 3064; viz, 587 in  
Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and  
1364 in America. The inhabitants of our  
globe profess more than 1000 different  
religions The number of men is about  
equal to the number of women. Ihe  
average of human life is about 83 years.  
One-fourth die previous to 7 years, one­  
half before reaching 17 years of age, and  
those who pass that age enjoy a felicity  
(?) refused to one-half of the human  
species. To every 1000 persons, only  
one reaches one hundred years of age; to  
every 100 only six reaches the age of  
sixty-six, and not more than one in 500  
live to eighty years of age.  
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 of  
inhabitants, and of these 333,333,833 die  
every year, 91,424 every day, 3830 every  
hour, 60 every minute, and 1 every second.  
These losses are about balanced by an  
eq al number of births. The married  
are longer-lived than the single, and  
above nil, those who observe a sober and  
industrious conduct. Tail men live lon­  
ger than short ones! Women have more  
chances of life in their favour previous to  
being 50 years of age, then men, but fewer  
afterwards.  
The number of marriages is in propor­  
tion to 175 to tevery 1000 individuals,—  
Marriages are more frequent alter the  
equinoxes —that is, during the months of  
June and December.  
Those born in the spring are generally  
more robust than others. Births and  
deaths are more frequent by night than  
by tiny. The number of men capable of  
working or bearing arms is calculated at  
one-fourth of the population.  
Some of these statements are rather

while thogfe who (Srthntlbialize in Decem­

which come off in June are brought about  
by green fields and the contagious in­

while those which happen in December

Interesting; Statistic*.  
A gentleman who keeps the run of fact*,  
figures, and babies, has just laid before &quot; an  
inquiring world&quot; the following statistics. The  
whole numb#!* of languages spoken in the  
world amount to 3,064?687 in Europe, 936  
in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.  
The inhabitants of our globe profess more than  
1,000 different religions. The number of men  
is about squal to tne number of women. The  
average of human life it about 33 years. One  
quarter part die previous to the age of seven  
years, one-half before reaching seventeen years  
of age, and those who pass this age enjoys a  
falicity refused to one-half the human species.  
To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100  
years of life; to every 100 only six reaches  
the age of 66, and not more than one in 500  
live to 80 years. There are on earth 1,000,000,*  
000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333  
die every year, 91,324, every day 3,730 every  
hour, thirty every minute, or one every second.  
These losses are about balanced by an equal  
number of births. The married are longer  
lived than the single, and above all those who  
observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall  
men live longer than short ones. Women have  
more chances of life in their favor previous  
to being 50 years of age than men have, fewer  
afterwards. The number of marriages in pro­  
E&gt;rtion of 175 to every 1,000 individuals.  
arriages are more freauent after the equi­  
noxes; that is, during tne months of June  
and December. Those born in the spring are  
generally more robust than others. Births  
and deaths are more frequent by night than by  
day. The number of men capable of working  
or bearing arms is calculated at one-fourth of  
the population.  
Some of these statements are rather singu­  
lar, and yet many of them are susceptible of  
an easy solution. That marriages take place  
more frequently in Jnne, and December, than  
other months of the year, was what we always  
suspected was the case. Those who marry in  
June do so because they can&#x27;t help it, while  
those who connubalize in December, do so,  
doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows  
which distinguish the frost-bitten months of  
winter. The matches which come off in June  
are commonly love matches, and are brought  
about by green fields, and the contagions in­  
fluence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while  
those which happeu in December are brought  
about, in a great degree, by mixing plain  
mathematics with the market value of flannel  
nnder garments.?National Monitor.

Interesting Statistics.  
A gentleman who kcops Iho run ol  
of fuels, figures, and babies, lias just laid  
before &quot;an inquiring world&quot; tlie follow­  
ing statistics. The jvliole tiumbor ol  
languages spoken in the world amount  
to 3,064?587 in Europe, 936 ill Asia,  
276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.?  
The inhabitants of our globe profess  
more than 1000 different religions.?  
The number of men is about equal to  
the number of woman. The average of  
human life is about 33 years. One  
quarter part die previous to the age of  
seven years, one-half before reaching  
seventeen years of age, and those who  
pass this age enjoy a felicity refused to  
one-half the human species. To every  
1,000 persons only 1 reaches 100 years  
of life, to every 100 only six reaches the  
ago of 66, and not more than one iu 500  
live to 80 years. There is on earth 1,­  
000,000,000, of inhabitants, and of these  
333,333,333 dio every year, 91,324 ev­  
ery day, 3,730 every hour, thirty evory  
minute, or one every second. These  
losses arc about balanced by an equal  
numborofbiiths. The married aro lon­  
ger lived than the single, and abovo all  
those who observe a sober and industri­  
ous conduct. Tall men live longer than  
shortones, Woman have more chances  
of life in their favor previous to being  
50 years of age than men have, fewer  
afterwards. The number of marriages  
is in proportion of 175 to ovory 1,000  
individuals. Marriages aro more fre­  
quent alter the equinoxes; that is during  
the months of June and Docember.?  
Those born in the spring aro generally  
more robust than others, ISirths and  
deaths are more frequent by night than  
by day. The number of men capable  
of working orbearingarms is calculated  
at one-fourth of the population.  
Some of these statements are rather  
singular, and yet many of them are sus­  
ceptible of an easy solution. That mar­  
riages take place more frequently in  
June and December, than other mouths  
of the year, was what we always suspec­  
ted was the case. Those who marry in  
June do so because they caut holp it,  
while those who connubialize in Decem­  
ber, do so, doubtless, to guard against  
the ehilly pillows which distinguish the  
froBt.bitleti months of winter. The  
matches which come off in June aro com­  
monly love matches, and aro brought a­  
bout by green fields, and the contagious  
influence ofrfeftWiokund.yollow.bi&#x27;ds;  
while those happening in December are  
brought about, iu a great degree, by  
mixing plain mathematics with the mar­  
ket value of flannel under garments.?

Excessive Eating.  
  
In a letter to Lord Murray, found in the  
Life of Sydney Smith, lately published, the  
latter says :—‘“ You are, I hear, attending  
more to diet than heretofore. If you wish  
any thing like happiness in the fifth act of  
life, eat and drink about half what you could  
eat and drink. Did I ever tell you my cal-  
culation about eating and drinking? Hav-  
ing ascertained the weight that I could live  
upon, so as to preserve health and strength,  
and what I did live upon, I found that be-  
tween ten and seventy years of age I had  
eaten and drunk forty-four one-horse wagon  
loads of meat and drink more than would  
have preseryed me in life and health! The  
value of this mass of nourishment is con-  
sidered to be worth $35,000. This is a  
frightful calculation, but irresistibly true;  
— I think, dear Murray, your wagons  
would require an additional horse each.“  
  
Facts Worth Noting.  
  
The whole number of languages spoken  
in the world amounts to 2528; namely, 587  
in Europe, 396 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and  
1264 in America. The inhabitants of the  
globe profess more than 1000 different re-  
ligions. The number of men is about equal  
to the number of women. The average of  
human life is about 83 years. QOne-quarter  
die previous to the age of 7 years, and one-  
half before reaching 17. Of every 1000  
persons 1 reaches 100 years of life, of every
