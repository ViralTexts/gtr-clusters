INTERESTING STATISTICS.  
  
A gentleman who keeps the run of facts, figures, and babies, has just laid before &quot;an inquiring world&quot; the following statistics:  
  
The whole number of languages spoken in the world amount to 3,064; viz., 587 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.—The inhabitants of our globe profess more than 1,000 different religions. The number of men is about equal to the number of women. The average of human life is about 33 years. One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years, one half before reaching 17 years of age, and those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) refused to one half the human species. To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100 years of age; to every 100, only six reach the age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of age.   
  
There are on the earth, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333 die every year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every hour, 60 every minute, or 1 every second. These losses are about balanced by an equal number of births. The married are longer lived than single, and, above all, those who observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall men live longer than short ones! Women have more chances of life in their favor previous to being 50 years of age than men, but fewer afterwards.  
  
The number of marriages is in proportion of 175 to 1,000 individuals. Marriages are more frequent after the equinoxes—that is during the months of June and December. Those born in the spring are generally more robust than others. Births and deaths are more frequent by night than by day. The number of men capable of working or bearing arms, is calculated at one-fourth of the population.  
  
Some of these statements are rather singular, and yet many of them are susceptible of an easy solution. That marriages take place more frequently in June and December, than other months of the year, was just what we have always suspected was the case. Those who marry in June, do so because they can&#x27;t help it; while those who connubialize in December, do so doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows which distinguish the frost-bitten months of winter. Those matches which come off in June are commonly love-matches, and are brought about by green fields, and the contagious influence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while those which happen in December are brought about in a great degree by mixing plain mathematics with the market value of flannel undergarments.

than men, but fewer afterwards.  
The number of marriages is in proportion of  
175 to every 1000 individuals. Marriages are

while those who connubiaiize in December do  
so, doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows

1364 in America. The inhabitants of our

equal to the number of women. Ihe  
average of human life is about 83 years.  
One-fourth die previous to 7 years, one­

those who pass that age enjoy a felicity  
(?) refused to one-half of the human  
species. To every 1000 persons, only  
one reaches one hundred years of age; to  
every 100 only six reaches the age of  
sixty-six, and not more than one in 500  
live to eighty years of age.  
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 of  
inhabitants, and of these 333,333,833 die  
every year, 91,424 every day, 3830 every

These losses are about balanced by an  
eq al number of births. The married  
are longer-lived than the single, and  
above nil, those who observe a sober and  
industrious conduct. Tail men live lon­  
ger than short ones! Women have more  
chances of life in their favour previous to  
being 50 years of age, then men, but fewer  
afterwards.  
The number of marriages is in propor­

Marriages are more frequent alter the  
equinoxes —that is, during the months of  
June and December.  
Those born in the spring are generally

Interesting Statistics.  
A gentleman who keeps the run of  
facts, figures and babies, has just laid  
before &quot;an enquiring world&quot; the follo­  
wing statistics: The whole number of  
languages 8oken in the world amount  
to 3,064 in Europe, 836 in Asia; 276 in  
Africa, and 1,261 in America. The in­  
habitants of our globe profess more than  
1,000 different religions. The number  
ef men is about equal to the number of  
women. Ihe averaye ol human lite is  
about 83 years, i One quarter part die  
previous to the age of 7 years; one half  
before reaching 17 years ot age, and  
those who pass this age enjoys a felicity  
refused to one half the human species.  
To every 1000 persons only one reaches  
100 years of life; to every 100 only six  
reach the age of 06. and not more than  
one in five nundred live to 80 years of  
ago. , There are on thoearth 1,000,000 000  
of inhabitants and of these 333,333,333  
die every year, 91 324 every day, 3,710  
every hour, 60 every minute or one every  
second. These losses are about balanced  
by an equal nnmbor of births. The ma­  
rried. are longer lived than tho single, and  
above all, those who observe a sober and  
industrious conduct. Tall men live lon­  
ger than short ones. Women have more  
chances of life in their favor previous to  
being Í0 years of ago than men have,  
but fewer afterwards. The number of  
marriages is in proportion of 175 to every  
1,000 individuals. Marriages are more  
frequent after the equinoxes; that is. da­  
ring (he months of June and December.  
Those born in the spring are generally  
more robust than others. ( Births and  
deaths are more frequent by night than  
by day. The number of men capable of

these statements are rather singular, nl
