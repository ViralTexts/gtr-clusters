INTERESTING STATISTICS.  
  
A gentleman who keeps the run of facts, figures, and babies, has just laid before &quot;an inquiring world&quot; the following statistics:  
  
The whole number of languages spoken in the world amount to 3,064; viz., 587 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.—The inhabitants of our globe profess more than 1,000 different religions. The number of men is about equal to the number of women. The average of human life is about 33 years. One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years, one half before reaching 17 years of age, and those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) refused to one half the human species. To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100 years of age; to every 100, only six reach the age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of age.   
  
There are on the earth, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333 die every year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every hour, 60 every minute, or 1 every second. These losses are about balanced by an equal number of births. The married are longer lived than single, and, above all, those who observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall men live longer than short ones! Women have more chances of life in their favor previous to being 50 years of age than men, but fewer afterwards.  
  
The number of marriages is in proportion of 175 to 1,000 individuals. Marriages are more frequent after the equinoxes—that is during the months of June and December. Those born in the spring are generally more robust than others. Births and deaths are more frequent by night than by day. The number of men capable of working or bearing arms, is calculated at one-fourth of the population.  
  
Some of these statements are rather singular, and yet many of them are susceptible of an easy solution. That marriages take place more frequently in June and December, than other months of the year, was just what we have always suspected was the case. Those who marry in June, do so because they can&#x27;t help it; while those who connubialize in December, do so doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows which distinguish the frost-bitten months of winter. Those matches which come off in June are commonly love-matches, and are brought about by green fields, and the contagious influence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while those which happen in December are brought about in a great degree by mixing plain mathematics with the market value of flannel undergarments.

Interesting Miscellany—Interesting Statis­  
tics. —A gentleman who keeps the run of facts  
figures and babies, has just laid before &quot;an in­  
quiring world&quot; the following statistics:  
The whole number of languages spoken in  
the world amount to 3064, viz : 586 in Europe,  
937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1364 in Ameri­  
ca. The inhabitants of our globe profess more  
than 1000 different religions. The number of  
men is about equal to the number of women.  
The average of human life is about 33 years.  
One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years,  
one half before reaching 17 years of age, and  
those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) re­  
fused to ojie half the human species. To every  
1000 persons, only one reaches 100 years of  
age; to every one hundred only six reach the  
age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to  
80 years of age.  
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 inhabi­  
tants, and of these 333 ,333,333 die every year,  
91,324 evéry day, 3730 every hour, 60 every  
minute, or 1 every second. The losses are  
about balanced by an equal number of births.  
The married are longer-lived than the single,  
and above all, those who observea sober and in­  
dustrious conduct. Tall men live longer than  
short ones! Women have more chances of life  
in their favor previous to being 50 years of age,  
than men, but fewer afterwards.  
The number of marriages is in proportion of  
175 to every 1000 individuals. Marriages are  
more frequent after the equinoxes—that is,  
during the months of June and December.  
Those born in the spring are generally more  
robust than others. Births and deaths are more  
frequent by night than by day. The number  
of men capable of working or bearing arms is  
calculated at one-fourth of the population.  
Some of these statements are rather singu­  
lar, and yet many of them are susceptible of an  
easy solution. That marriages take place more  
frequently in June and December, than other  
months of the year, was just what we have al­

Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and  
1364 in America. The inhabitants of our  
globe profess more than 1000 different  
religions The number of men is about  
equal to the number of women. Ihe  
average of human life is about 83 years.  
One-fourth die previous to 7 years, one­  
half before reaching 17 years of age, and  
those who pass that age enjoy a felicity  
(?) refused to one-half of the human  
species. To every 1000 persons, only  
one reaches one hundred years of age; to  
every 100 only six reaches the age of  
sixty-six, and not more than one in 500  
live to eighty years of age.  
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 of  
inhabitants, and of these 333,333,833 die  
every year, 91,424 every day, 3830 every  
hour, 60 every minute, and 1 every second.  
These losses are about balanced by an  
eq al number of births. The married  
are longer-lived than the single, and  
above nil, those who observe a sober and  
industrious conduct. Tail men live lon­  
ger than short ones! Women have more  
chances of life in their favour previous to  
being 50 years of age, then men, but fewer  
afterwards.  
The number of marriages is in propor­  
tion to 175 to tevery 1000 individuals,—  
Marriages are more frequent alter the  
equinoxes —that is, during the months of  
June and December.  
Those born in the spring are generally  
more robust than others. Births and  
deaths are more frequent by night than  
by tiny. The number of men capable of  
working or bearing arms is calculated at  
one-fourth of the population.  
Some of these statements are rather  
singular, and yet many of them are sus­  
ceptible of an easy solution. 1 hat mar­  
riages take place more frequently in June  
and December than other months of the  
year, was just what we have always ex­  
pected was the case. Those who marry  
in .June* do so because they can’t help it;  
while thogfe who (Srthntlbialize in Decem­  
ber, do so doubtless to guard against the  
chilly pillows which distinguish the frost­  
bitten months of winter. The matches  
which come off in June are brought about  
by green fields and the contagious in­  
fluence of bobolinks and yellow-birds;  
while those which happen in December  
are brought about, in a degree, by mixing  
p&#x27;ain mathematics with the market value  
of flannel under-garments.—N. Y. Dutch

Interesting; Statistic*.  
A gentleman who keeps the run of fact*,  
figures, and babies, has just laid before &quot; an  
inquiring world&quot; the following statistics. The  
whole numb#!* of languages spoken in the  
world amount to 3,064?687 in Europe, 936  
in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.  
The inhabitants of our globe profess more than  
1,000 different religions. The number of men  
is about squal to tne number of women. The  
average of human life it about 33 years. One  
quarter part die previous to the age of seven  
years, one-half before reaching seventeen years  
of age, and those who pass this age enjoys a  
falicity refused to one-half the human species.  
To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100  
years of life; to every 100 only six reaches  
the age of 66, and not more than one in 500  
live to 80 years. There are on earth 1,000,000,*  
000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333  
die every year, 91,324, every day 3,730 every  
hour, thirty every minute, or one every second.  
These losses are about balanced by an equal  
number of births. The married are longer  
lived than the single, and above all those who  
observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall  
men live longer than short ones. Women have  
more chances of life in their favor previous  
to being 50 years of age than men have, fewer  
afterwards. The number of marriages in pro­  
E&gt;rtion of 175 to every 1,000 individuals.  
arriages are more freauent after the equi­  
noxes; that is, during tne months of June  
and December. Those born in the spring are  
generally more robust than others. Births  
and deaths are more frequent by night than by  
day. The number of men capable of working  
or bearing arms is calculated at one-fourth of  
the population.  
Some of these statements are rather singu­  
lar, and yet many of them are susceptible of  
an easy solution. That marriages take place  
more frequently in Jnne, and December, than  
other months of the year, was what we always  
suspected was the case. Those who marry in  
June do so because they can&#x27;t help it, while  
those who connubalize in December, do so,  
doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows  
which distinguish the frost-bitten months of  
winter. The matches which come off in June  
are commonly love matches, and are brought  
about by green fields, and the contagions in­  
fluence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while  
those which happeu in December are brought  
about, in a great degree, by mixing plain  
mathematics with the market value of flannel  
nnder garments.?National Monitor

Facts About Human Life.  
There are about 3,064 languages in  
the world, and its inhabitants profess  
more that 1,000 religions. The num­  
ber of men is about equal to the num­  
ber of women. The average of life is  
about thirty-three years. To 1,000 per­  
sons, only one reaches 100 years of life;  
to every 100, six reach the age of sixty­  
five, and not more than one in 600 lives  
to eighty years. There are on the earth  
1,000,000,000 inhabitants. Of these 33,­

longer than short ones. Women have  
more chances of life in their favor, pre­

have, but fewer afterward. The num­
