INTERESTING STATISTICS.  
  
A gentleman who keeps the run of facts, figures, and babies, has just laid before &quot;an inquiring world&quot; the following statistics:  
  
The whole number of languages spoken in the world amount to 3,064; viz., 587 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.—The inhabitants of our globe profess more than 1,000 different religions. The number of men is about equal to the number of women. The average of human life is about 33 years. One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years, one half before reaching 17 years of age, and those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) refused to one half the human species. To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100 years of age; to every 100, only six reach the age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of age.   
  
There are on the earth, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333 die every year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every hour, 60 every minute, or 1 every second. These losses are about balanced by an equal number of births. The married are longer lived than single, and, above all, those who observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall men live longer than short ones! Women have more chances of life in their favor previous to being 50 years of age than men, but fewer afterwards.  
  
The number of marriages is in proportion of 175 to 1,000 individuals. Marriages are more frequent after the equinoxes—that is during the months of June and December. Those born in the spring are generally more robust than others. Births and deaths are more frequent by night than by day. The number of men capable of working or bearing arms, is calculated at one-fourth of the population.  
  
Some of these statements are rather singular, and yet many of them are susceptible of an easy solution. That marriages take place more frequently in June and December, than other months of the year, was just what we have always suspected was the case. Those who marry in June, do so because they can&#x27;t help it; while those who connubialize in December, do so doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows which distinguish the frost-bitten months of winter. Those matches which come off in June are commonly love-matches, and are brought about by green fields, and the contagious influence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while those which happen in December are brought about in a great degree by mixing plain mathematics with the market value of flannel undergarments.

Interesting Miscellany—Interesting Statis­  
tics. —A gentleman who keeps the run of facts  
figures and babies, has just laid before &quot;an in­  
quiring world&quot; the following statistics:  
The whole number of languages spoken in  
the world amount to 3064, viz : 586 in Europe,  
937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1364 in Ameri­  
ca. The inhabitants of our globe profess more  
than 1000 different religions. The number of  
men is about equal to the number of women.  
The average of human life is about 33 years.  
One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years,  
one half before reaching 17 years of age, and  
those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) re­  
fused to ojie half the human species. To every  
1000 persons, only one reaches 100 years of  
age; to every one hundred only six reach the  
age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to  
80 years of age.  
There are on the earth 1,000,000,000 inhabi­  
tants, and of these 333 ,333,333 die every year,  
91,324 evéry day, 3730 every hour, 60 every  
minute, or 1 every second. The losses are  
about balanced by an equal number of births.  
The married are longer-lived than the single,  
and above all, those who observea sober and in­  
dustrious conduct. Tall men live longer than  
short ones! Women have more chances of life  
in their favor previous to being 50 years of age,  
than men, but fewer afterwards.  
The number of marriages is in proportion of  
175 to every 1000 individuals. Marriages are  
more frequent after the equinoxes—that is,  
during the months of June and December.  
Those born in the spring are generally more  
robust than others. Births and deaths are more  
frequent by night than by day. The number  
of men capable of working or bearing arms is  
calculated at one-fourth of the population.  
Some of these statements are rather singu­  
lar, and yet many of them are susceptible of an  
easy solution. That marriages take place more  
frequently in June and December, than other  
months of the year, was just what we have al­  
ways suspected was the case. Those who mar­  
ry in June, do so because they can&#x27;t help it;  
while those who connubiaiize in December do  
so, doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows  
which distinguish the frost-bitten months of  
winter. The matches which come off in June  
are commonly love matches, and are brought  
about by green fields and the contagious influ­  
ence of boblinks and yellow birds: whilst those  
which happen in December are brought about,  
in a degree, by mixing plain mathematics with  
the market value of flannel undcr-garments.

A gentleman who keeps the run of fact*,

whole numb#!* of languages spoken in the  
world amount to 3,064?687 in Europe, 936  
in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.  
The inhabitants of our globe profess more than  
1,000 different religions. The number of men  
is about squal to tne number of women. The

quarter part die previous to the age of seven

of age, and those who pass this age enjoys a  
falicity refused to one-half the human species.  
To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100  
years of life; to every 100 only six reaches  
the age of 66, and not more than one in 500  
live to 80 years. There are on earth 1,000,000,*  
000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333  
die every year, 91,324, every day 3,730 every  
hour, thirty every minute, or one every second.  
These losses are about balanced by an equal  
number of births. The married are longer

observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall  
men live longer than short ones. Women have  
more chances of life in their favor previous

Some of these statements are rather singu­  
lar, and yet many of them are susceptible of  
an easy solution. That marriages take place  
more frequently in Jnne, and December, than  
other months of the year, was what we always  
suspected was the case. Those who marry in  
June do so because they can&#x27;t help it, while  
those who connubalize in December, do so,  
doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows  
which distinguish the frost-bitten months of  
winter. The matches which come off in June  
are commonly love matches, and are brought  
about by green fields, and the contagions in­

those which happeu in December are brought

Interesting Statistics.  
A gentleman who kcops Iho run ol

ing statistics. The jvliole tiumbor ol  
languages spoken in the world amount  
to 3,064?587 in Europe, 936 ill Asia,  
276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.?  
The inhabitants of our globe profess  
more than 1000 different religions.?  
The number of men is about equal to  
the number of woman. The average of  
human life is about 33 years. One  
quarter part die previous to the age of  
seven years, one-half before reaching  
seventeen years of age, and those who  
pass this age enjoy a felicity refused to  
one-half the human species. To every  
1,000 persons only 1 reaches 100 years  
of life, to every 100 only six reaches the  
ago of 66, and not more than one iu 500  
live to 80 years. There is on earth 1,­  
000,000,000, of inhabitants, and of these  
333,333,333 dio every year, 91,324 ev­  
ery day, 3,730 every hour, thirty evory  
minute, or one every second. These  
losses arc about balanced by an equal  
numborofbiiths. The married aro lon­  
ger lived than the single, and abovo all  
those who observe a sober and industri­  
ous conduct. Tall men live longer than  
shortones, Woman have more chances  
of life in their favor previous to being  
50 years of age than men have, fewer  
afterwards. The number of marriages  
is in proportion of 175 to ovory 1,000  
individuals. Marriages aro more fre­  
quent alter the equinoxes; that is during  
the months of June and Docember.?  
Those born in the spring aro generally  
more robust than others, ISirths and  
deaths are more frequent by night than  
by day. The number of men capable  
of working orbearingarms is calculated  
at one-fourth of the population.  
Some of these statements are rather  
singular, and yet many of them are sus­  
ceptible of an easy solution. That mar­  
riages take place more frequently in  
June and December, than other mouths  
of the year, was what we always suspec­  
ted was the case. Those who marry in  
June do so because they caut holp it,  
while those who connubialize in Decem­  
ber, do so, doubtless, to guard against  
the ehilly pillows which distinguish the  
froBt.bitleti months of winter. The  
matches which come off in June aro com­  
monly love matches, and aro brought a­  
bout by green fields, and the contagious  
influence ofrfeftWiokund.yollow.bi&#x27;ds;  
while those happening in December are  
brought about, iu a great degree, by  
mixing plain mathematics with the mar­  
ket value of flannel under garments.
