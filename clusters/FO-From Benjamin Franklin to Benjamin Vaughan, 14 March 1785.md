My dear Friend  
Passy, March 14. 1785  
  
Among the Pamphlets you lately sent me, was one intitled Thoughts on Executive Justice. In return for that I send you a French one on the same Subject, Observations concernant l’Execution de l’Article II de la Declaration sur le Vol. They are  
  
both address’d to the Judges, but written as you will see in a very different Spirit. The English Author is for hanging all Thieves. The Frenchman is for proportioning Punishments to Offences.  
If we really believe, as we profess to believe, that the Law of Moses was the Law of God, the Dictate of divine Wisdom infinitely superior to human, on what Principles do we ordain Death as the Punishment of an Offence, which according to that Law was only to be punish’d by a Restitution of Fourfold? To put a Man to Death for an Offence which does not deserve Death, is it not Murder? And, as the French Writer says, Doit-on punir un délit contre la société, par un crime contre la nature?  
Superfluous Property is the Creature of Society. Simple and mild Laws were sufficient to guard the Property that was merely necessary. The Savage’s Bow, his Hatchet, &amp; his Coat of Skins, were sufficently secured without Law by the Fear of personal Resentment &amp; Retaliation. When by virtue of the first Laws Part of the Society accumulated Wealth &amp; grew Powerful, they enacted others more severe, and would protect their Property at the Expence of Humanity. This was abusing their Power, &amp; commencing a Tyranny. If a Savage before he enter’d into Society had been told, Your Neighbour by this Means may  
  
become Owner of 100 Deer, but if your Brother, or your Son, or yourself, having no Deer of your own, and being hungry should kill one of them, an infamous Death must be the Consequence; he would probably have preferr’d his Liberty, &amp; his common Right of killing any Deer, to all the Advantages of Society that might be propos’d to him.—  
That it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape, than that one innocent Person should suffer, is a Maxim that has been long &amp; generally approv’d, never that I know of controverted. Even the sanguinary Author of the Thoughts agrees to it page 163, adding well, that “the very Thought of injured Innocence, and much more that of suffering Innocence, must awaken all our tenderest and most compassionate Feelings, and at the same time raise our highest Indignation against the Instruments of it.— But, he adds, there is no Danger of either from a strict Adherence to the Laws.”— Really?— Is it then impossible to make an unjust Law?— And if the Law it self be unjust, may it not be the very “Instrument” which ought to “raise the Author’s, &amp; every body’s, highest Indignation.” I read in the last Newspaper from London, that a Woman is capitally convicted at the Old Bailey for privately stealing out of a Shop some Gause value 14 Shillings and threepence. Is there any Proportion between the Injury done by a Theft value 14/3, and the Punishment of a human Creature by Death on a Gibbet? Might not that Woman by her Labour have made the Reparation ordain’d by God, in paying four-fold? Is not all Punishment inflicted beyond the Merit of the Offence, so much Punishment of Innocence? In this light, how vast is the annual Quantity of not only injured but suffering Innocence, in almost all the civilized States of Europe!  
  
But it seems to have been thought that this kind of Innocence may be punish’d by way of preventing Crimes. I have read indeed of a cruel Turk in Barbary, who whenever he bought a new Christian Slave, ordered him immediately to be hung up by the Legs &amp; to receive an 100 Blows of a Cudgel on the Soles of his Feet, that the severe Sense of the Punishment, and Fear of incurring it thereafter, might prevent the Faults that should merit it.— Our Author himself would hardly approve entirely of this Turk’s Conduct in the Government of Slaves, and yet he appears to recommend something like it for the government of English Subjects, when he applauds* [in the margin: *Page 105.] the Reply of Judge Burnet to the convict Horsestealer, who being ask’d what he had to say why Judgment of Death should not pass against him, &amp; answering that it was hard to hang a Man for only stealing a Horse, was told by the Judge, “Man thou art not to be hang’d only for stealing a Horse, but that Horses may not be stolen.” The Man’s Answer, if candidly examin’d, will I imagine, appear reasonable, as being founded on the Eternal Principle of Justice &amp; Equity, that Punishments should be proportion’d to Offences: and the Judge’s Reply brutal and unreasonable; tho’ the Writer “wishes all Judges to carry it with them whenever they go the Circuit, and to bear it in their Minds, as containing a wise Reason for all the penal Statutes which they are called upon to put in Execution:—” it at once illustrates, says he, the true Grounds “and Reasons of all capital Punishments whatsoever, namely, that every man’s Property as well as his Life, may be held sacred and inviolate”. Is there then no difference in Value between Property and Life? If I think it right that the Crime of Murder should be punished with Death, not only as an equal Punishment of the Crime, but to prevent other Murders, does it follow that I must approve of inflicting the same Punishment for a little Invasion of my Property  
  
by Theft? If I am not myself so barbarous, so bloody-minded and revengeful, as to kill a Fellow Creature for stealing from me 14/3, how can I approve of a Law that does it? Montesquieu, who was himself a Judge, endeavours to impress other Maxims; he must have known what humane Judges feel on such occasions, and what the Effect of those Feelings; and so far from thinking severe &amp; excessive Punishments prevent Crimes, he asserts, as quoted by our French Writer, page 4. that  
“L’atrocité des loix en empêche l’execution.  
“Lorsque la peine est sans mesure, on est souvent obligé de lui préférer l’impunité.  
“La Cause de tous les relâchemens, vient de l’impunité des crimes, &amp; non de la moderation des peines.”—  
It is said by those who know Europe generally, that there are more Thefts committed and punish’d annually in England, than in all the other Nations put together. If this be so, there must be a Cause or Causes, for such Depravity in our common People. May not one be, the Deficiency of Justice &amp; Morality in our national Government, manifested in our oppressive Conduct to Subjects, &amp; unjust Wars on our Neighbours.— View the long-persisted-in unjust monopolizing Treatment of Ireland at length acknowledged! View the plundering Government exercis’d by our Merchants in the Indies! The confiscating War made upon the American Colonies! and to say nothing of those upon France and Spain, view the late War upon Holland, wch was seen by impartial Europe in no other Light than that of a War of Rapine &amp; Pillage, the Hopes of an immense &amp; easy Prey being its only apparent &amp; probably its true &amp; real Motive &amp; Encouragement. Justice is as strictly due between neighbour Nations as between neighbour Citizens. A Highwayman is as much a Robber when he plunders in a Gang, as when single; and a Nation that makes an unjust War is only a great Gang. After employing your People in robbing the Dutch, is it strange that being put out of that Employ by the Peace, they should continue  
  
robbing, and rob one another?— Piraterie, as the French call it, or Privateering, is the universal Bent of the English Nation at home and abroad, where ever settled. No less than 700 Privateers were, it is said, commission’d in the last War!— These were fitted out by Merchants to prey upon other Merchants who had never done them any Injury. Is there probably any one of those privateering Merchants of London, who were so ready to rob the Merchants of Amsterdam, that would not as readily plunder another London Merchant of the next Street, if he could do it with the same Impunity? The Avidity, the alieni appetens, is the same, it is Fear alone of the Gallows that makes the Difference. How then can a Nation which among the honestest of its People has so many Thieves by Inclination, and whose Government encourag’d &amp; commission’d no less than 700 Gangs of Robbers; how can such a Nation have the Face to condemn the Crime in Individuals, and hang up 20 of them in a Morning. It naturally puts one in Mind of a Newgate Anecdote. One of the Prisoners complain’d that in the Night somebody had taken his Buckles out of his Shoes. What the Devil, says another, have we then Thieves among us?— It must not be suffer’d. Let us search out the Rogue, &amp; pump him to death.—  
There is however one late Instance of an English Merchant who will not profit by such ill-gotten Gains. He was it seems part Owner of a Ship which the other Owners thought fit to employ as a Letter of Marque, and which took a Number of French Prizes. The Booty being shar’d, he has now an Agent here, enquiring by an Advertisement in the Gazette, for those who suffer’d the Loss, in order to make them, as far as in him lies, Restitution.— This consciencious Man is a Quaker. The Scotch  
  
Presbyterians were formerly as tender, for there is still extant an Ordinance of the Town Council of Edinburgh, made soon after the Reformation, forbidding “the purchase of Prize Goods under Pain of losing the Freedom of the Burgh for ever, with other Punishment at the Will of the Magistrate, the Practice of making Prizes being contrary to good Conscience and the Rule of treating Christian Brethren as we would wish to be treated: and such Goods are not to be sold by any godly Men within this Burgh” The Race of these godly Men in Scotland is probably extinct, or their Principles abandoned, since as far as that Nation had a Hand in promoting the War against the Colonies, Prizes &amp; Confiscations are believ’d to have been a considerable Motive.—  
It has been for some time a generally receiv’d Opinion, that a military Man is not to enquire whether a War be just or unjust; he is to execute his Orders. All Princes who are dispos’d to become Tyrants must probably approve of this Opinion, &amp; be willing to establish it. But is it not a dangerous one? since, on that Principle, if the Tyrant commands his Army to attack and destroy, not only an unoffending Neighbour Nation, but even his own Subjects, the Army is bound to obey. A Negro Slave in our Colonies, being commanded by his Master to rob or murder a Neighbour, or do any other immoral Act, may refuse, and the Magistrate will protect him in his Refusal. The Slavery then of a Soldier is worse than that of a Negro! A consciencious Officer, if not restrain’d by the Apprehension of its being imputed to another Cause, may indeed resign; rather than be employ’d in an unjust War; but the private Men are Slaves for Life, and they  
  
are perhaps incapable of judging for themselves.— We can only lament their Fate; and still more that of a Sailor, who is often dragg’d by Force from his honest Occupation, and compell’d to imbrue his Hands in perhaps innocent Blood. But methinks it well behoves Merchants, Men more enlightned by their Education, and perfectly free from any such Force or Obligation, to consider well of the Justice of a War, before they voluntarily engage a Gang of Ruffians to attack their Fellow Merchants of a neighbouring Nation, to plunder them of their Property, &amp; perhaps ruin them &amp; their Families, if they yield it, or to wound, maim &amp; murder them if they endeavour to defend it.— Yet these Things are done by Christian Merchants, whether a War be just or unjust; and it can hardly be just on both sides.— They are done by English and American Merchants, who nevertheless complain of private Thefts, and hang by Dozens the Thieves they have taught by their own Example.—  
It is high time for the sake of Humanity that a Stop be put to this Enormity. The United States of America, tho’ better situated than any European Nation, to make Profit by Privateering, most of the Trade of Europe with the West Indies passing before their Doors, are, as far as in them lies, endeavouring to abolish the Practice, by offering in all their Treaties with other Powers, an Article engaging solemnly that in Case of future War no Privateers shall be commission’d on either Side, and that unarm’d Merchant Ships on both sides shall pursue their Voyages unmolested. This will be a happy Improvement of the Law of Nations. The Humane and the Just cannot but wish general Success to the Proposition.—  
With unchangeable Esteem &amp; Affection, I am, my dear Friend Ever yours

MONG the pamphlets you  
lately fent me, was one, en-  
titled, Thoughts on Executive Fufice.  
In return for that, I fetid ‘you a  
French one on the fame firbject,  
Obfervations concernant I’ Exécution de  
PArticle 11. de la Déclaration fur le  
¥ol. They are bothaddreffed tothe  
judges, but written, as you will  
fee, ina very different fpirit. The  
Englifh author is for hanging aif  
thieves. ‘The Frenchman is for  
proportioning punifhments to of-  
fences.  
  
If we really believe, 2s we pro-  
fefs to believe, that the law of Mo-  
fes was the law of God, the dic-  
tate of divine wifdom, infinitely  
fuperior to human; on what prin-  
ciples do we ordain death as the  
punifhment of an offence, which,  
according to that law, was only to  
be punithed by a reftitution of  
fourfold’? Fo put 2 man to death  
for an offence which does not de-  
ferve death, is it not 4 murder?  
And, as the French writer fays,  
Doit-on punir un délit contre la fociete  
‘per un crime contre la nature ?  
  
Superfluous property is thecrea-  
ture of fociety, Simple and mild  
laws wete fufficient to guard the  
Property that was merely necefla-  
tv. The favage’s bow, his hatchet,  
and his coat of fkins, were futhici-  
  
ently fecured, without law, by the  
  
fear of perfonal refentment and re-  
taliation. When, by virtue of the  
  
March 14th, 1785.  
firft laws, part of the fociety act  
cumulated wealthand grew power-  
ful, they enacted others more’ fe-  
vere, and would proteét their pto-  
perty at the expence of humanity.  
This was abufing thet? power, and  
commencing a tyranny. Ifa fa-  
vage, before he entered into focie+  
ty, had been told—* Your neigh-  
bour, by this means, may become  
owner of an hundred deer; But  
if your brother, or your fon, or  
yourfelf, having no deer of your  
own, and being hungry, fhould  
kill one, an infamous death muft  
be the confequence:” he would  
probably have preferred his liberty,  
and his common right of killing  
dny deer, to all the advantages of  
fociety that might be propofed to  
him.  
That it is better 2 hundred guif-  
ty perfons fliould efcape, than that  
one innocent perfon fhould fuffer,  
is a maxim that has been long and  
  
enerally approved; never, that I  
F now of, controverted, Even the  
fangninary author of the Thoughts  
agrees to it, vig 2 well, “ that  
the very thought of ijured inno-  
cence, and much more that of /u/-  
fering innocence, muft awaken al]  
our tendereft and moft compaf-  
fionate feelings, and at the fame  
time raife our higheft indignation  
ceaint the inftruments of it. But,”’  
he adds, “there is no danger of

the laws.’’&quot;——Really! Is it then im-  
poffible to make an unjuft law?  
and if the law itfelf beunjuft, may  
it not be the very * inftrument”  
which ought ** to raifethe author&#x27;s  
and every body’s higheft indigna-  
tion” I fee, in the laft newfpa-  
pers from London, that a woman  
is Capitally convicted at the Old  
Bailey, for privately ftealing out of  
a fhop fome gauze, value fourteen  
fhillings andthree-pence: Is there  
any proportion between the inju-  
ry done by a theft, value fourteen  
fhillings and three-pence, and the  
punifhment of a human creature,  
by death, ona gibbet? Might not  
that woman, by her labour, have  
made the reparation ordained by  
God, in paying fourfold? Is not  
all punifhment infli@ed beyond  
the merit of the offence, fo much  
unifhmentof innocence? In this  
fight, how vaft is the annual quan-  
tity, of not only izjured but /uffer-  
ing innocence, in almoft all the  
civilized ftates of Europe!  
But it feemsto have been thought  
that this kind of innocence may  
be punifhed by way of preventing  
crimes. I have read, indeed, of a  
crucl Turk in Barbary, who, when-  
ever he bought a new Chriftian  
flave, ordered him immediately to  
be hung up by the legs, and to re-  
ceive a hundred blows of a cudgel  
on the foles of his feet, that the fe-  
vere fenfe of the punifhment, and  
fear of incurring it thereafter,might  
prevent the faults that fhould me-  
rit it. Our author himfelf would  
hardly approve entirely. of the  
Turk’s condué in the government  
of flaves; and yet he appears tore-  
commend fomething like it for the  
government of Englith fubjeéts,  
when Aeapplauds the reply of judge  
Burnet to the conviét horfe-fteal-  
er; who being afked what he had  
to fay why judgment of death  
fhould not pafs againft him, and  
an{wering, thatit was hard to hang  
  
  
  
On the Criminal Laws, &amp;2,  
  
a man for only ftealing-a hotfe, wag  
told by -the judge, * Man, thou  
art not to be hanged only for fteal-  
ing a horfe, but that horfes may  
not be. ftolen.” The man’s an-  
{wer, if candidly examined, will,  
I imagine, appear reafonable, as  
being founded on_the eternal prin.  
ciple of, juftice. and equity, that  
punifhments fhould be proportion-  
ed to offentes; and the judye’s re-  
ply brutal and unreafonable, tho’  
the writer * withes all judges to  
carry it:with them whenever they  
go the circuit, and to bear it in  
their minds, as containing a wile  
reafon for all the penal ftatutes  
which they are called upon to put  
in execution. Itatonce illuftrates,”’  
fays he, “the true grounds and  
reafons of all capital punifhments  
whatfoever, namely, that every  
man’s property, as well as his life,  
may be held facred and inviolate.”  
Is.there then no difference in va;  
lue between property and life? If  
I think it right that the crime of  
murder fhouid be punifiied with  
death, not only as an equal punifh,  
ment of the crime, but to prevent  
other murders, does it follow that  
I muft approve of inflicting the  
fame punifhment for a little inva-  
fion on my property by theft? If  
Iam not myfelf fo barbarous, fo  
bloody-minded, and revengeful, as  
to kill a fellow-creature for fteal-  
ing from me fourteen fhillings and  
three-pence, how can I approve of  
a law that does it? Montefquieu,  
who was himfelf a judge, endea-  
vours to imprefs other maxims.  
He muft have known what hv-  
mane judges feel on fuch occafions,  
and what the effeéts of thofe feel-  
ings; and, fo far from thinking that  
fevere and exceflive punifhments  
prevent crimes, he afferts, as quote  
by our French writer, that  
“© Larrocite des loix en empiche  
Vexdcution.  
és Lor {que

on off Jouvent obligé de lui préférer  
Pimpunité.  
  
“ La caufe de tous les relachemens  
vient de Pimpunité des crimes, et nom  
de la modévation des peines.”  
  
It is faid by thofe who know  
Europe generally, that there are  
more thefts committed and punifh-  
ed annually in England, than in  
allthe other nations put together,  
If this be fo, there muft be a caufe  
or caufesfor fuch depravity in our  
common people. May not one be  
the deficiency of juftice and mo-  
rality in our national government,  
manifefted in our oppreffive con;  
dué&amp;t to fubjects, and unjuft wars  
onour neighbours? View the long  
perfifted in, unjuft, monopolizing  
treatment of Ireland, at length ac-  
knowledged! View, the plunder-  
ing government exercifed by our  
merchants in the Indies; the con-  
fifcating war made upon the Ame-  
  
Tican colonies; and, to fay nothing  
of thofe upon France and Spain;  
view the late’ war upon Holland,  
which was feen by impartial Eu-  
rope in no other light than that of  
awar of rapine and pillage; the  
hopesof an immenfe and eafy prey  
being its only apparent, and pro-  
bably its true and real motive and  
encouragement. Juftice isas ftrict-  
ly due between neighbour nations,  
a3 between neighbour citizens.  
Ahighwayman is as much a.rob-  
ber when he plunders in a gang,  
as when fingle; and a nation that  
makesan unjuft war is only a great  
gang. After employing your peo-  
ple in robbing the Dutch, it 1s  
ftrange that, being put out of that  
employ by peace, they ftill con-  
tinue robbing, and rob one ano-  
ther? Piraterie, as the French call  
It, Or privateering, is the univerfal  
bent of the LEnglifl nation, at  
homeand abroad, wherever fettled.  
No lefs than feven hundred priva-  
  
605  
teers were, it is faidy.commiffion-  
ed in the laft war! Thefe were  
fitted out by merchants,’ to prey  
upon other merchants, who had  
never done them any injury. Is  
there probably any one. of thofe  
privateering merchants of London,  
who were fo ready to rob the mer-  
chants of Amfterdam, that would  
not as readily plunder another  
London merchant of the next ftreet,  
if he could do it with the fame im-  
punity! The avidity, the alient  
appetens is the fame: it is the fear  
alone of the gallows that: makes the  
difference. How them cana, na~  
tion, which, among the honefteft  
of its people, has fo many thieves  
by. inclination, and. whofe governs  
ment encouraged and commiflion-  
ednolefs thanfeven hundred gangs  
of robbers; how.can fuch a nation  
have the face to condemn the  
crime in individuals, and hang up  
twenty of them in a morning! Jt  
naturally puts one in mind -ofa  
Newgate anecdote. One of the  
prifoners complained, that in the  
night fomebody had , taken. his  
buckles out of his foes. “* What  
the devil!” fays another, “ have  
we then shevesamongft us? It muft  
not be fuffered. Lets fearch oug  
the rogue, and pump hintodeath.’?  
There is, however, one late in-  
{tance of an Englifh merchant who  
will not profit by fuch ill-gotter  
gain. He was, it feems, part-  
owner of a fhip, which the other  
owners thought fit to employ as a  
letter of marque, and which took  
a number of French prizes. . The  
booty being fhared, he has now an  
agent here enquiring, by an ad-  
vertifement in the Gazette, for  
thofe who fuffered the lofs, in or-  
der to make them, as far as in him  
lies, reftitution. This confcien-  
tious man is a Quaker. The Scotch .  
Pretbyterians were formerly as ten-

dinance of the town-council of  
Edinburgh, made foon after’ the  
Reformation, “ forbidding the pur-  
chafe of prize goods, undér ‘pain  
of lofing the freedom of the burgh  
for ever, with other punifhment at  
the wiltofthemagitrate; the prac-  
fice‘of making prizes being con-  
trary to good confcience, and the  
rule of treating Chriftian brethren  
as we would wifh to be treatéd:  
and fuch ds ‘are mot to be fold  
by any godly-men within this burgh.”  
The race of thefe godly men in  
Scotland is probably extinét, or  
their principles abandoned, fince,  
as far as that nation had a hand in  
promoting the war againft the co-  
lonies, prizes and confifcations are  
believed to have been a confider:  
zble mottve.  
  
It has been for fome time 2 ge-  
nerally received’ opinion, that a  
military mat is’not to enquire  
whether a war be juft or unjuft;  
he is to execute his orders. — All  
princes whoare difpofed to become  
tyrants, muft probably approve of  
this opinion, and be willing to efta-  
blith it; but is it not a dangerous  
one? fince, on that principle, if  
the tyrant commands his army to  
éttack and deftroy, not only an  
unoffending neighbour nation, but  
even his own fubiedts, the armty js  
bound to obey. A negro flave, in  
ourcolonies, being commanded by  
his mafter to rob or murder 2  
neighbour, or do any other immo-  
ral aét, may refufe; and the ma:  
giftrate will protect him in his re-  
fufal. The flavery then of a fol-

MONG the phamphlets you  
  
lately fent me was one en-  
titled, “ Thoughts on Executive  
Juftice.” In return for that I fend  
you a French one on the fame fub-  
ject, entitled, “ Obfervations con-  
cernant l’Exécution de |’ Article If.  
dela Declaration fur le Vol.” They  
are both addrefled to the judges,  
but written as you will fee, in a  
very different fpirit,. The Englifh  
author is for hanging all thieves;  
the Frenchman is for proportioning  
punifhments to offences.  
+ If we really believe, as we pro-  
fefs to believe, that the law of  
Mofes is the law of God, and the  
digtates of divine wifdom infinitely  
{uperior to human; on what prin-  
ciples do we ordain death as the  
punifhment of an offence which,  
according to that law, was only to  
be puniihed by a reftitution of tour-  
  
March 14,1785,  
fold? To put aman to death fora  
crime which does not deferve death,  
is it not a murder? And as the  
French writer lays, ** Doit-on punir  
“un delit contre la jociété par an  
‘© crime contre Ja nature ?”  
  
Superfluous property is the crea-  
ture of fociety. Simple and mild  
laws were fufficient to guard the  
property that was merely neceilary.  
The favage’s bow, his hatchet, and  
his coat of fkins, were fufficiently  
fecured, without law, bY the fear of  
perfonal refentment and retaliation.  
When, by virtue of the firlt laws,  
part of the ‘fociety accumulated  
wealth and grew powerful, they  
enatted others more fevere, and  
would proteé&amp; their property at the  
expence of humanity. ‘This was

‘‘ this means may become owner of  
“an hundred deer; but if your  
“ brother, or your fon, or yourfelf,  
* having no deer of your own, and  
“being hungry, fhould kill one,  
‘an infamous death muft be the  
“ confequence;”” he would pro-  
bably have preterred-his liberty, and  
his common right of killing any  
deer, to all the advantages of fociety  
that might be propofed to him.  
That it is better an hundred  
guilty perfons efcape, than that one  
innocent perfon fhould fuffer, is a  
maxim that has been long and  
generally approved, and never,  
that I know of, controverted,  
Even the fanguinary author of the  
&quot;s Thoughts, &amp;c.” agrees to it, ob-  
ferving, “ that the very thought of  
‘* injured innocence, and much  
*¢ more that of fuffering innocence,  
© muft awaken all our tendereft  
* and mott compaffionate feelings,  
‘and, at the fame time, raife our  
“ higheft indignation againft the  
* initruments of it. But,’’ he adds,  
* there is no danger of either from  
“a {triét adherence to the laws.”  
Really ?—Is it then impoffible to  
make an unjult law? And if the  
law itfelf be unjuft, may it not  
be the very “ inflrument” which  
ought “to raife the author’s and  
every body&#x27;s highelt indigna-  
“tion?” I fee, in the laft new!  
papers from London, that a woman  
is capitally conviéted at the Old  
Bailey. for privately ftealing out of a  
fhop fome gauze, value fourteen  
fhillings and three-pence, and the  
punifbinent of an human créature  
for this offence is by death on a  
gibbei ! Might not that woman, by  
her own Jabour and indultry, have  
made the reparation ordained by  
God in paying fourfold? Is not atl  
punifhment inilied beyond the  
merit of the offence, {omuch pnuilh-  
ment of inndcence? In this light  
how va{i is the annual quantity of  
not only injured but fuffering im-  
nocence, in almoft all the civilized  
  
fates of Europe 9  
  
But it feems to have been thought:  
  
that this kind of innocence may be  
punifhed by way of preventing  
crimes. I have read indeed of a  
cruel ‘Turk in Barbary, who, when-  
ever he bought a new Chriflian  
flave, ordered him immediately to be  
hung up by the heels, and to re-  
ceive an hundred blows of a crudgel  
on the foles of his feet, that the  
fevere fenfe of the punifhment, and  
fear of incurring it thereafter, might  
prevent the faults that fhould merit  
it, Our author himfelf,would  
hardly approve entirely of this  
Turk’s condué in the government  
of ilaves, and yet he appears to re-  
commend fomething like it for the  
government of Englifh fubjeéts,  
Mie applauds the reply of Judge  
Burnet to the conviéted horle  
ftealer, who being afked what he  
had to fay, why judgement of death  
  
fhould not be paffed againft him?’  
  
and anf{wering. that it was hard to  
hang a man for only ftealing an  
horfe, was told by the judge, ‘ Man,  
** thou art not to be hanged only for  
* ftealing a horfe, but that horfes  
* may not be ftolen.”  
  
But the man’s an{wer, if candidly  
examined, will, I imagine, appear  
reafonable, as being founded upon  
the eternal principles of juftice and  
equity, that punithments fhould be  
proportioned to offences, and the  
judge’s reply brutal and unreafon-  
able, though the writer *“ wifhes all  
** judges to carry it with them when-  
*- ever they go the circuit, and to  
‘bear it in their minds, as con-  
“taining a wife reafon for all the  
‘penal ftatutes which they are  
*‘ called upon to put iw execution.  
* It at once illuftrates (fays he) the  
* truce grounds and reafons of all  
“capital punifhments whatlocver,  
“namely, that every man’s pros  
* perty, as well as his life. may be  
* held facred and inviolate.”  
  
Is there then no difference in  
value between property and hfe?  
If I think it right that the crime of  
inurder fhould be punifhed with  
death, woi only as an equal punith-

ment of the crime, but to prevent  
ether murders, does it follow that I  
muft approve of infliéting the fame  
unifhment for a little invafion on  
my property by theft? If 1 am not  
myfelf {fo barbarous, fo bloody-  
minded, and revengeful as to kill a  
fellow creature for ftealing from me  
fourteen fhillings and three-pence,  
how can I approve of a law that  
does it ?  
  
Montefquieu, who was himfelf a  
judge, endeavours to impre(s other  
maxims. He muft have known  
what humane judges feel on fuch  
occafions, and what the effeéts of  
thofe feelings are; and fo far from  
thinking that fevere and exceilive  
  
unifhments prevent crimes, he  
alferts, as quoted by our French  
writer, that  
  
“ L’atrocité des loix en empéche

‘‘ la caufe de tous les relache-  
“mens vient *de Vimpunite des  
‘crimes, et non de la moderation  
“ des peines.”  
  
It is faid by thofe who knew  
Europe generally, that there are  
more thefts cemmitted and punifhed  
annually in England, than in all  
the other nations put together. If  
this be fo, there muft be a caufe or  
caufes for fuch grofs depravity in  
the common people. May not one  
be the deficiency of jultice and  
morality in our national govern-  
ment, manifefted in our oppreilive  
conduét to fubjeéts, and unjuft wars  
to our neighbours ? View the long-  
perfifted-in, unjuft, monopolizing  
treatment of Ireland at length ac-  
knowledged.  
  
View the plundering govern-  
ment exercifed by our merchants in  
the Indies, the -confleating war  
made upon the American colonies,  
and, to fay nothing of thofe upon  
France and Spain, view the late  
war upon Holland, which was feen  
by impartial Europe in no other  
fight than that of a war of sapine  
  
44$  
and pillage, the hopes of an im-  
mente and eafy prey being its only  
apparent and, probably, its true and  
real motive and encouragement,  
  
Juftice is as ftriGly due between,  
neighbour nations, as between  
neighbour citizens. An highway-  
man is as mucha robber when he  
plunders in a gang as when fingle;  
and a nation that makes an unjuft  
war is only a great gang. After  
employing your people in robbing  
the Dutch, 1s it flrange, that being  
put out of that employment by  
peace, they fiill continue robbing  
and plundering one another?  
  
Privaterie, as the French call it,  
or privateering, is the univerial  
bent of the Englifh nation, at home  
and abroad, wherever fettled. Neo  
lefs than feven hundred privateers  
were, it is faid, commiffioned in the  
laft war! Thefe were fitted out by  
merchants to prey upon other mer-  
chants, who had never done them  
any injury. Is there any one of  
thofe privateering merchants in  
London, ‘who were fo ready to rob  
the merchants of Amfterdam, that  
would not as readily plunder ano-  
ther London merchant of the next  
{lreet, if he could do it with the  
fame impunity? ‘The avidity, the  
alient appetens, is the fame: it 1s the  
fear alone of the gallows that makes  
the difference.  
  
How then can a nation, which,  
amongft the honefteft of its peaple,  
has fo many thieves by inclination,  
and whofe government encouraged  
and commiflioned no le{fs than  
feven hundred gangs of robbers,  
how can fuch a nation have the  
face to condemn the crime in indi-  
duals, and hang up twenty of them  
in a morning! It naturally puts  
onein mind of a Newgate anecdote:  
one of the prifoners complained  
that in the night fomebody had  
taken his buckles out of his thoes;  
* What the devil!’ fays another,  
“have we then thieves amongtt  
“us? It moft not be fuifered, let  
“us fearch out the rogue, and pump

There is, however, one late in-  
ftance of an Englifh merchant who  
would not profit by fuch ill-gotten  
gain. He was, it feems, part owner  
of a fhip, which the other owners  
thought fit to employ as a letter of  
marque, and which took a number  
of French prizes. The booty being  
Thared, he has now an agerit here  
enquiring by an advertifement in  
the Gazette, for thofe who fuffered  
the lofs, in order to make them, as  
far asin him lies, reftitution. ‘This  
‘confcientious man is a Quaker.  
  
The Scotch Prefbyterians were  
formerly as tender; for there is  
fill extant an ordinance of the  
town-council of Edinburgh, made  
foon after the reformation, forbid-  
ding “ the purchafe of prize goods,  
«under pain of lofing the freedom  
¢ of the burgh for ever, with other  
“ punifhment at the will of the  
“ magiftrates, the praftice of making  
*‘ prizes being contrary to good  
«© con{cience, and the rule of treat-  
“ing Chriftian brethren as we  
“would with to be treated; and  
* {uch goods are not to be fold by  
s¢ any godly men within this burgh.”  
The race of thefe godly men in  
Scotland is probably extiné, or  
their principles abandoned, fince,  
as far as that nation had a hand  
in promoting the war againit the  
colonies, prizes and confifcations  
are believed to have been a con-  
fiderable motive.  
  
It has been for fome time a  
generally received opinion, that a  
military man is not to enquire whe-  
ther a war be juft or unjuft; he is  
to execute his orders. All princes,  
who are difpofed to become tyrants,  
moft probably approve of this opi-  
nion, and are willing to eftablifh it;  
but is it not a dangerous one? fince  
on that principle, if the tyrant com-  
mands his army to attack and de-  
ftroy not only an unoffending  
neighbour nation, but cven hisown  
fubjeéts, the army is boand to obey.  
A negro flave in out-colonies, being  
commanded by his mafter to rob or  
murder a neighbour, or do any  
  
other immoral aé&amp;, may refufe, and’  
  
the magiftrate will prote&amp; him in  
his refulal. The flavery then of a  
foldier is worfe than that of a negro!  
A confcientious officer, if not re-  
{trained by the apprehenfion of its  
being imputed to another caufe,  
may indeed refign, rather than be  
employed in an unjuft war; but  
the private men are flaves for life;  
and they are, perhaps, incapable of  
  
judging for themfelves, We can  
  
only lament their fate, and ftill  
more that of a failor, who is often  
dragged by force from his honeft  
occupation, and compelled to im-  
brue his hands in, perhaps, innocent  
blood. But methinks it well be-  
hoves merchants (men more en-  
lightened by their education, and  
perfectly free from any fuch force  
or obligation) to contider well of  
the juftice of a war, before they vo-  
luntarily engage a gang of ruffians to  
attack their tellow-merchants of a  
neighbouring nation, to plunder  
them of their property, and, per-  
haps, ruin them and their families  
if they yield it, or to wound, maim,  
and murder them, if they endeavour  
to defend it. Yet thefe things are  
done by Chriftian merchants, whe-  
ther a war be juft or unjuft; and it  
can hardly be juit on both fides,

once illuitrates (fays he) the true grounds and reafons of all ca-  
pital punifhinents whatfoever, namely, that every man’s a.  
ty, as well as his life, may be held facred and inviolate.” Is there  
then no difference in value between property and life? If | think  
it right that the crime of murder fhould be punifhed with death,  
not only as an equal puniihment of the crime, but to prevent  
other murders, does it follow that | muft approve of the fame  
punifhinent for a little invafion on my property by theft? If  
I am not myfelf fo barbarous, fo bloody-minded, and revengeful,  
as to kill a fellow-creature for ttealing from me fourteen {hiilings  
and three-pence, how can | approve of a law that does it? Mon-  
tefquieu, who was himielf a judge, endeavors to imprefs other  
maxims. He mufthave known what humane judges feel on fuch  
occafions, and what the effects of thofe feelings; and, fo far from  
thinking that fevere and excellive puniihments prevent crimes, he  
aflerts, as quoted by our French writer, that  
  
“* 1? atrocite des loix en cmpeche I’ execution.  
  
“ Lorf{que la peine eft fans mefure, on eft fouvent oblige de lui  
*¢ preferer Pimpunite.  
  
‘* La caufe des tous lesrelachemens vient de Vimpunite des crimes,  
“ et non de la moderation des peines.’’  
  
It is faid by thofe who know Europe generally, that there are  
more thefts committed and puniihed annually in England than in  
all the other nations put together. If this be fo, there mutt be a  
caufe or caufes, forfuch depravity in our commbn people. May  
not one be the deficiency of juftice and morality in our national  
government manitefted in our oppreilive conduct to fubjects, and  
unjuft wars on our neighbors? View thelong perfiited in, unjatt,  
nionopolizing treatment of Ireland, at length acknowledged !  
View the plundering government exercifed by our merchanis in  
the Indies; the conifcating war made upon the American colo-  
nies ; and, to fay nothing of thofe upon France and Spain, view  
the late war upon Holland, which was {een by impartial Europe  
in no other light than that of a war of rapine and pillage; the  
hopes of an iminenfe and ealy prey being its only apparent, and  
probably its true and real motive and encouragement. Juitice is  
as ftrictly due between neighbor nations as between neighbor ci-  
tizens. A highwayman is as much a robber when he plunders in a  
gang, as when fingle ; and a nation that makes an unjuit war is  
only a oo gang. After employing your people in robbing  
the Dutch, is it ftrange that, being out of that employ by peace,  
they ftill continue robbing, and rob one another? Piraterie, asthe  
French call i:, or privateering, is the univerfal bent of the Eng-  
lith nation, at home and abroad wherever fettled. Nolefs than  
feven hundred privateers were, it is faid, commiffioned in the  
lait war! Thele were fitted ous by merchants, to prey upon

other merchants, who had never done them any injury. Is there  
probably any one of thofe privateering merchants of London,  
whe were fo ready to rob the merchants of Amfterdam, tha:  
would not as reaidy plunder another London merchant of the  
next ftreet, if he could do it with the fame impunity ! “The avidity  
the alieni appetens is the fame ; it is the fear alone of the gallows  
that makes the difference. Pow then can a nation, which,  
among the honeitelt of its people, has fo many thieves by inclina-  
rion, aad whofe government enconraged and commiffioned no  
lefs than feven hundred gangs of robbers; how can fuch a nation  
have the face to conden the crime in individuals, and hang ap  
twenty of them in amerning! It naturally puts one in mind of a  
Newgate anecdote. One of the prifoners complained, that in  
the night fome body had taken his buckles out of his thoes.  
“* Wharthe devil!” fays another,’ “ have we then thieves amongtt  
us? It mut not be fuifered. Let us fearch ont the rogue, aiid  
puinp him to death.”  
  
Lhere is, however, one late inftance of an Englith merchant  
who wiil not profit by fach ill-gotted gain. He was, it feems,  
part owner of a thip, which the other ewners thought fit to em-  
ploy as a letter of marque, and which took a number of Frénch  
prizes. Lhe booty being fhared, he has now an agent here  
enguiring, by an advertilement inthe Gazette, for thofe who  
fuuttered the lofs, in order to make them, as far as in him lies, re-  
ititution. This confcientious man is a Quaker. The Scotch  
Prefbyterians were formerly as tender; for there is ftil! extant  
an ordinance of the town-council of Edmburgh, inade feon after  
the Retormation, “‘ forbidding the purchafe of prize goods, un-  
der pain of loofing the freedom of the burgh for ever, with other  
punithment, at the will of che magiftrate’; the practice of mak-  
ing prizes being contrary to good ¢onfcience, and the rule of treat-  
ing Chriftian brethren as we would with to be treated; and fuch  
goods are not tobe fold by any godly man within this burgh.” The  
race of thefe godly men in Scotland is probably extinct, or their

principles abandoned, fince, as far as that’ nation had a hand in  
  
“pronioting the war againit the colonies, prizes and confifcations  
are believed to Have been a confiderable motive.  
  
It has been for fome time a generally-received opinion, that a  
military man is ‘not to enquire whether a war be juft or unjuft,  
he isto execute his orders. All princes who are difpofed to be  
come tyrants, muft probably approve of this opinion, and be wil-  
ling to eftablith it; but is it not a dangerous one? fince, on that  
principle, if the tyrant commands his ariny to attack and deftroy,  
not only an unoffending neighbor nation, but even his own fub-  
jects, the army is bound to obey. A negro {lave in our colonies,  
being commanded by his mafter to rob or murder a roe pe or

than thatof anegro! A coiftientious officer, if not refrained  
by the apprehenfion of its being imputed to another caufe, may  
indeed relign, rather than be employed in an unjuft War, but the  
private men are flaves for life , and they are perhaps incapable  
of judging for themfelves. We can only lament their fate, and  
ftill more that of a failor, who is often dragged by force from his  
honeft o¢cupation, and conipélled to imbrue his hands in perhaps  
innocent blood. But methinks it well behoves merchants (men  
more enlightened by their education, and perfectly free from any  
fuch force er obligation) to confider well of the juftice of a war,  
before they voluntarily engage a gang of ruffians tw attack their  
fellow-merchants of a neighboring nation, to plunder them of  
their property, and perhaps ruin them and their families, if they  
yield it; or to wound, maim and murder them, if they attem  
to defend it- Yet thefe things are doneby Chriftian merchants,  
whether a war be juft or unjutt; and it can hardly be juft om  
both fides. They are done by Engliih and American mer-  
chants, who, neverthelefs, complain of private theft, and hang  
by dozens the thiev es they have taught by their own example.  
It is high time, for the fake of humanity, that a itop were put  
to this enormity. The Unived States of America, thought better  
firuated than any European nation to make profit by privateer-  
ing, (mott ef the trade of Eupope, with the Weit-Indies pafling  
before their doors) are, as far asin them lies, endeavoririg to abo-  
lith the practice, by offering, i in all their treaties With other  
powers, an article, engaging folemnly, that, in cafe of future  
war, 10 privateer fhall be commiflioned on either fide; an@

voyages unmoletted*. This will be a happy improvement of thé

perfectly free from any such force or obliga¬

before they voluntarily engage a gang of  
ruffians to attack their fellow-mcichants of a  
neighboring nation, to plunder them of their  
property, and perhajis ruin them and their

it. Yet these things arc done by cliristian  
merchants, whether a war be just or unjust;  
and it can bardiy be just on both sides*  
They arc done by English and American  
merchants, who, nevertheless, complain ol  
private theft, and hang by dozens the thieves

Exouish Honasty.—A highwayman is as much a robber when he plunders in a  
gang, as when single ; and a nation that makes an unjust war is only a great gang.  
After employing your people in robbing the Dutch, strangeit is, that, being put out of  
that employ by peace, they still continue robbing, and rob one another? Viraterie, as  
the French call it, or privateering, is the universal bent of the English nation, at home  
and abroad, wherever settled. No less than seven hundred privateers, were, it is said,  
commissioned in the last war! ‘These were fitted out by merchants, to prey upon other  
merchants, who had never done them any injury. Is there, probably, any one of those  
privateering merchants of London, who were so ready to rob the merchants of Amster-  
dam, that would not as readily rob another London merchant, of the next street, if he  
could do it with the same impunity? The avidity, alieni appetens, is the same ; it is  
the fear alone of the gallows that makes the difference. How then can a nation, which,  
among the honestest of its people, has so many thieves by inclination, and whose  
government encouraged and commissioned no less than seven hundred gangs of robbers ;  
how can such a nation have the face to condemn the crime in individuals, and hang up  
twenty of them in amorning? It naturally puts one in mind of a Newgate anecdote :  
one of the prisoners complained, that in the night, somebody had taken his buckles out  
of his shoes. ‘‘ What the devil!’’ says another, ‘* have we then thieves amongst us?  
{t must not be suffered. Let us search out the rogue, and pump him to death.”’-

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
My Dear Frienp, March, 14, 1785.  
  
Amone the pamphlets you lately sent me was one, enti-  
tled, Thoughts on Executive Justice. In return for that, I  
send you a French one on the same subject, Observations  
concernant  Exécution de V Article II. de la Décluration sur  
le Vol. They are both addressed to the judges, but written,  
as you will see, in a very different spirit. The English au-  
thor is for hanging all thieves. The Frenchman is for pro-  
portioning punishments to offences.  
  
If we really believe, as we profess to believe, that the law  
of Moses was the law of God, the dictate of Divine wisdom,  
infinitely superior to human; on what principles do we or-  
dain death as the punishment of an offence, which, accord-  
ing to that law, was only to be  arwpeny by a restitution of  
fourfold? To puta man to death for an offence which does  
not deserve death, is it not a murder? And, as the French  
writer says, Doit-on punir un délit contre la société par un  
crime contre la nature ?  
  
Superfiuous property is the creature of society, Simple  
and mild laws were sufficient to guard the property that was  
merely necessary. The savage’s bow, his hatchet, and his  
coat of skins, were sufficiently secured, without law, by the  
fear of personal resentment and retaliation. When, by vir-  
tue of the first laws, part of the society accumulated wealth  
and grew powerful, they enacted others more severe, and  
would protect their property at the expense of humanity.  
This was abusing their power, and commencing a tyranny.  
If a savage, before he entered into society, had been told—  
‘ Your neighbor, by this means, may become owner of a hun-  
dred deer ; but if your brother, or your son, or yourself, hav-  
ing no deer of your own, and being hungry, should kill one,  
an infamous death must be the consequence, he would pro-  
bably have preferred his liberty, and his common right of kill-  
ing any deer, to all the advantages of society that might be  
proposed to him.  
  
That itis better a hundred guilty persons should escape,  
than that one innocent person should suffer, is a maxim that  
has been long and generally approved ; never that I know of,  
controverted. Even the sanguinary author of the Thoughts  
agrees to it, adding well, ‘that the very thought of injured  
innocence, and much more that of suffering innocence, must  
awaken all our tenderest and most compassionate feelings,  
and at the same time raise our highest indignation against the  
instruments of it. But,’ he adds, ‘there is no danger of  
either, from a strict adherence to the laws.’—Really !—Is it  
then impossible to make an unjust law; and if the law itself  
be unjust, may it not be the very ‘instrument’ which ought  
‘toraise the author’s and every body’s indignation” I see  
in the last newspapers from London, that a woman is capital-  
ly convicted at the Old Bailey, for privately stealing out of a  
shop some gauze, value fourteen shillings and threepence. Is  
there any proportion between the injury done bya theft, value  
fourteen shillings and threepence, and the punishment ofa hu-  
man creature, by death,on a gibbet? Might not that woman, by  
her labor, have made the reparation ordained by God in paying  
fourfold ? Is not all punishment inflicted beyond the merit of  
the offence, so much punishment of innocence? In this  
light, how vast is the annual quantity, of not only injured but  
suffering innocence, in almost all the civilized states of Eu-  
rope.  
  
ut it seems to have been thought, that this kind of inno-  
cence may be punished by way of preventing crimes, I have  
read, indeed, of acruel Turk, in Barbary, who whenever he  
bought a new Christian slave, ordered him immediately to be  
hung up by the legs, and toreceive a hundred blows of a cud-  
gel on the soles of his feet, that the severe sense of the pun-  
ishment, and fear of incurring it thereafter, might prevent the  
faults that should merit it. Our author himself would hardly  
approve entirely of this Turk’s conduct in the government of  
slaves: and yet he appears to recommend something like it  
for the government of English subjects, when he applauds  
the reply of Judge Burnet to the convict horse-stealer ; who,  
being asked what he had to say why judgment of death should  
  
  
  
not pass against him, and answering, that it was hard toh  
  
a man for only stealing a horse, was told by the judge, ‘ Man,  
thou art not to be hanged only for stealing a horse, but that  
horses may not be stolen.’ ‘The man’s answer, if candid  
examined, will, I imagine, appear reasonable, as being fond,  
ed on the eternal principle of justice and equity, that punish.  
ments should be proportioned to offences; and the judge&#x27;s  
reply brutal and unreasonable, though the writer ‘ wishes al}  
  
judges to carry it with them whenever they go the circuit,  
an  
  
to bear it, in their minds, as containing a wise reason for  
  
all the penal statutes which they are called oy to put in ex.  
ecution, It at once illustrates,’ says he, ‘the true grounds  
and reasons of all capital puni ts wh ver, namely,  
that every man’s property, as well as his life, may be held  
sacred and inviolate.’ Is there then no difference in value  
between property and life? If I think it right that the crime  
of murder should be punished with death, not only as an  
equal punishment of the crime, but to prevent other murders,  
does it follow that I must approve of inflicting the same pune  
ishment for a little invasion on my property by theft? If tom  
not myself so barbarous, so bloody-minded, and revengeful,  
as to kill a fellow-creature for stealing from me fourteen shil-  
lings and threepence, how can I approve of a law that does it?  
Montesquieu, who was himself a judge, endeavors to im-  
press other maxims. He must have known what humane  
Judges feel on such occasions, and what the effects of those  
feelings ; and, so far from thinking that severe and excessive  
punishment prevent crimes, he asserts, as quoted by our  
rench writer, that  
  
  
  
‘ Datrocité des loix en empéche Pexécution,  
  
* Lorsque la peine est sans mesure, on est souvent obligé de  
lui préférer Vimpunité.  
  
© La cause de tous les relichemens vient de Vimpunité des  
crimes, et non de la modération des peines.’  
  
It is said by those who know Europe generally, that there  
are more thes itted and punished annually in England,  
than in all the other nations put together. If this be so, there  
must be a cause or causes for such a depravity in our common  
people, May not one be the deficiency of justice and mo  
rality in our national government, manifested in our oppres-  
sive conduct to subjects, and unjust wars on our neighbors?  
View the long-persisted in, unjust, monopolizing treatment  
of Ireland, at length acknowledged! ‘View the plundering  
government exercised by our merchants in the Indies; the  
confiscating war made upon the American colonies ; and, to  
say nothing of those upon France and Spain, view the late  
war upon Holland, which was seen by impartial Europe inno  
other light than that of a war of rapine and pillage; the  
hopes of animmense and easy prey being its only apparent,  
and probably its true and real, motive and encouragement,  
Justice is as strictly due between neighbor nations, as be-  
tween neighbor citizens, A highwayman is as much a rob-  
ber when he plunders in a gang, as when single; and a na-  
tion that makes an unjust war 1s ye a _— gang. After  
employing your people in robbing the Dutch, is it strange,  
that being put out of that employ by peace, they still conti-  
nue robbing, and rob one another! Piraterie, as the French  
call it, or privateering, is the universal bent of the English na-  
tion, at home and abroad, wherever settled. No less than  
seven hundred privateers, were, it is said, commissioned in  
the last war! These were fitted out by merchants, to prey  
upon other merchants, who had never done them any injury.  
Is there probably any one of those privateering merchants of  
London, who were so ready to rob the merchants of Amster  
dam, that would not as readily plunder another London mere  
chant, of the next street, if he could do it with the same im-  
punity? The avidity, the alieni appetens is the same; it is  
the fear alone of the gallows that makes the difference. How  
then can a nation, which among the honestest of its people  
has so many thieves by inclination, and whose government  
encouraged and commissioned no less than seven hundred  
gangs of robbers ; how can sucha nation have the faceto  
condemn the crime in individuals, and hang up twenty of them  
ina morning! It naturally puts one in mind of a Newgate  
anecdote. One of the prisoners complained, that in the night,  
somebody had taken his buckles out of his shoes. ‘ What  
the devil!’ says another, ‘have we then thieves amongst us?  
It must not be suffered. Let us search out the rogue, and  
- him to death,’  
  
. There is, however, one late instance of an English mer-  
chant who will not profit by such ill-gotten gain. He was, it  
seems, part-owner of a ship, which the other owners thought  
fit to employ as a letter of marque, which took a number of  
French prizes. The booty being shared, he has now an agent  
here, inquiring, by an advertisement in the Gazette, for those  
who have suffered the loss, in order to make them, as far as  
in him lies, restitution. This conscientious man is a Quaker,  
The Scotch presbyterians were formerly as tender ; for there  
is still extant an ordinance of the town-council of Edinburgh,  
made soon after the Reformation, ‘forbidding the purchase of  
prize goods, under pain of losing the freedom of the burgh  
for ever, with other punishment at the will of the magistrate;  
the practice of making prizes being contrary to good con-  
science, and the rule of treating Christian brethren as we  
would wish to be treated; and such goods are not to be sold by  
any godly man within this burgh” The race of these godly  
men in Scotland are probably extinct, or their principles  
abandoned, since, as far as that nation had a hand in promote  
ing the war against the colonies, prizes and confiscations are  
believed to have been a considerable motive.  
  
It has been for some time a generally-received opinion,  
that a military man is not to inquire whether a war be just or  
unjust ? he is to execute his orders. All princes, who are  
disposed to become tyrants, most probably approve of this  
opinion, and be willing to establish it; but is it not a danger-  
ous one ? since, on that principle, if the tyrant commands his.

refusal, The slavery then ofa soldier is worse than that ofa  
negro! A conscientious officer, if not restrained by the —  
hension of its being imputed to another cause, ee re-  
sign, rather than be employed in an unjust war; but the pri-  
vate men are slaves for life; and they are, perhaps, incapa-  
ble of judging for themselves. We can only lament their  
fate, and still more that of a sailor, who is often dragged by  
force from his honest occupation, and compelled to imbrue his  
hands in perhaps innocent blood. But, methinks, it well be-  
hoves merchants (men more enlightened by their education,  
and perfectly free from any such force or obligation) to con-  
sider well of the justice of a war, before they voluntarily en-  
  
ea gang of ruffians to attack their fellow-merchants of a  
neighboring nation, to plunder them of their property, and  
perhaps ruin them and their families, if they yield it; or to  
wound, maim, and murder them, if they endeavor to defend  
it, Yet these things are done by Christian merchants, whe-  
ther a war be just or unjust; and it can hardly be just on  
bothsides. They are done by English and American mer-  
chants, who nevertheless, complain of private theft, and  
hang by dozens the thieves they have taught by their own ex-  
ample.  
  
tis high time, for the sake of humanity, that a stop were  
  
t to this enormity. The United States of America, ~  
  
ter situated than any European nature to make profit by  
privateering (most of the trade of Europe with the West In-  
dies, passing before their doors), are, as far as in them lies,  
endeavoring to abolish the practice, by offering, in all their  
treaties with other powers, an article, engaging solemnly, that  
in case of future war, no privateer shall be commissioned on  
either side ; and that unarmed merchant-ships, on both sides,  
shall pursue their voyages unmolested.* This will be a hap-  
py improvement of the aw of nations. The humane and the  
just cannot but wish general success to the proposition.  
  
With unchangeable esteem and affection,  
I am, my dear friend,  
  
Ever yours,
