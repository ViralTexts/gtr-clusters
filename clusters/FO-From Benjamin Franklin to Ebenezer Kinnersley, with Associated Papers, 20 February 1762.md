same. Does not this seem to indicate that the fire existed in the body, though in a quiescent state, before it was by any of these means excited, disengaged, and brought forth to action and to view? May it not constitute part, and even a principal part, of the solid substance of bodies? If this should be the case, kindling fire in a body would be nothing more than developing this inflammable principle, and setting it at liberty to act in separating the parts of that body, which then exhibits the appearances of scorching, melting, burning, &amp;c. When a man lights an hundred candles from the flame of one, without diminishing that flame, can it be properly said to have communicated all that fire? When a single spark from a flint, applied to a magazine of gunpowder, is immediately attended with this consequence, that the whole is in flame, exploding with immense violence, could all this fire exist first in the spark? We cannot conceive it. And thus we seem led to this supposition, that there is fire enough in all bodies to singe, melt, or burn them, whenever it is, by any means, set at liberty, so that it may exert itself upon them, or be disengaged from them. This liberty seems to be

stroyed in executing its office, though it does, at the same time, preserve the house. Indeed, in the construction of an instrument so new, and of which we could have so little experience, it is rather lucky that we should at first be so near the truth as we seem to be, and commit so few errors.  
There is another reason for sinking deeper the lower end of the rod, and also for turning it outwards under ground to some distance from the foundation; it is this, that water dripping from the eaves falls near the foundation, and sometimes soaks down there in greater quantities, so as to come near the end of the rod though the ground about it be drier. In such case, this water may be exploded, that is, blown into vapour, whereby a force is generated that may damage the foundation. Water reduced to vapour, is said to occupy 14,000 times its former space. I have sent a charge through a small glass tube, that has borne it well while empty, but when filled first with water, was shattered to pieces and driven all about the room: Finding no part of the water on the table, I suspected it to have been reduced to vapour; and was confirmed in that suspicion afterwards, when I had filled a like piece of tube with ink, and laid it on a sheet of clean paper, whereon, after the explosion, I could find neither any moisture nor any sully from the ink. This experiment of the explosion of water, which I believe was first made by that most ingenious electrician father Beccaria, may account for what we sometimes see in a tree struck by lightning, when part of it is reduced to fine splinters like a broom; the sap vessels being so many tubes containing a watry fluid, which when reduced to vapour, rends every tube length-ways. And perhaps it is this rarefaction of the fluids in animal bodies killed by lightning or electricity, that by separating its fibres, renders the flesh so tender, and apt so much sooner to putrify. I think too, that much of the damage done by lightning to stone and brick walls, may sometimes be owing to the explosion of water, found, during showers, running or lodging in the joints or small cavities or cracks that happen to be in the walls.

You seem to think highly of the importance of this discovery, as do many others on our side of the water. Here it is very little regarded; so little, that though it is now seven or eight years since it was made publick, I have not heard of a single house as yet attempted to be secured by it. It is true the mischiefs done by lightning are not so frequent here as with us, and those who calculate chances may perhaps find that not one death (or the destruction of one house) in a hundred thousand happens from that cause, and that therefore it is scarce worth while to be at any expence to guard against it. But in all countries there are particular situations of buildings more exposed than others to such accidents, and there are minds so strongly impressed with the apprehension of them, as to be very unhappy every time a little thunder is within their hearing; it may therefore be well to render this little piece of new knowledge as general and as well understood as possible, since to make us safe is not all its advantage, it is some to make us easy.

eless seem to indicate that the lightning was there: But as there is no mention of its having hurt any part of the beaufet, or of the walls of the house, I should rather ascribe that effect to the concussion of the air, or shake of the house by the explosion.  
Thus, to me it appears, that the house and its inhabitants were saved by the rod, though the rod itself was unjointed by the stroke; and that, if it had been made of one piece, and sunk deeper in the earth, or had entered the earth at a greater distance from the foundation, the mentioned small damages (except the melting of the points) would not have happened.

ftake that was driven about four or five feet into the earth,

the neceffity of finking the rod deeper, or at leaft till it comes  
into contact with water or moift earth, adapted to receive  
and convey away the electric fluid. ‘The Author gives another  
reafon for finking the lower end of the rod to a confiderable  
depth, and alfo for turning it outwards, under ground, to fome  
diftance from the foundation, as the water dripping from the  
eaves, and falling near the foundation, may fometimes foak

furrounding it is dry ; for it is now found that by the eledtrie

of the rod near the foundation. And here we find the princi-  
pal defeét of this apparatus. “The rod not being carried to a  
  
Tuffcient diftance from the foundation, nor low enough to ar-  
  
rive at water, or a fufficient quantity of moift earth, the elec-  
tric fluid, accumulated near its lower end, quitted the rod near  
the furface of the earth, and, dividing itfelf in fearch of other  
paflages, produced the effects above-mentioned. On the whole,  
the Author, on very good grounds, concludes, that the houfe  
and its inhabitants were faved by the rod, and that, ‘ if. it had  
been made of one piece, and had been funk deeper in the earth,  
or had entered the earth at a greater diftance from the founda-

action of bodies on cach other, he infers that the fire probably  
exifted in thefe bodies, though in a quiefcent itate, before it  
was by any of thefe means excited, difengaged, and brought  
forth to action and to view. ‘ If this fhould be the cafe, he  
adds, kindling fire in a body would be nothing more than de-  
veloping this inflammable principle, and fetting it at liberty to  
act in feparating the parts of that body, which then exhibits  
the appearances of {corching, melting, burning, &amp;c. Whena  
man lights an hundred candles from the fame of one, without  
diminifhing that flame, can it be properly faid to have commu-  
nicated all that fire? When a fingle {park from aflint, applied to  
a magazine of gunpowder, is immediately attended with this  
confequence, that the whole is in fame, exploding with im-  
menie violence, could all this fire exift firit in the fpark ?—We  
cannot conceive it.’  
  
An opinion not very different from the foregoing, we fhall  
obferve, was originally maintained, or at leaft firft reduced into  
a fyftem, by Homberg, Lemery, and other foreigners ; and is  
certainly more natural and fimple, and anfwers better to the

gives his own method by using a battery of four large glass  
jars, while at page 423 of the London edition of his ‘‘ Let-  
ters and Papers, etc.,” Franklin relates curious observations  
which are worth mentioning here. He says that he sent  
a charge of electricity ‘‘ through a small glass tube that had  
borne it well when empty, but when filled first with water  
was shattered to pieces and driven all about the room.  
Finding no part of the water on the table, I suspected it to  
have been reduced to vapor. I was confirmed in that sus-  
picion afterward when I had filled a like piece of tube with

plosion I could find neither any moisture nor any sully

which I believe was first made by that most ingenious

sometimes see in a tree struck by lightning, when part of it  
is reduced to fine splinters like a broom; the sap vessels be-  
ing so many tubes containing a watery fluid, which, when

haps it is this rarefaction of the fluids in animal bodies
