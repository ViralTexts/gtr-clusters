All Europe is on our side of the Question, as far as Applause and good Wishes can carry them. Those who live under arbitrary Power do never the less approve of Liberty, and wish for it. They almost despair of recovering it in Europe; they read the Translations of our separate Colony Constitutions with Rapture, and there are such Numbers every where who talk of Removing to America with their Families and Fortunes as soon as Peace and our Independence shall be established, that tis generally believed we shall have a prodigious Addition of Strength, Wealth and Arts, from the Emigrations of Europe and tis thought that to lessen or prevent such Emigrations, the Tyrannys established there must relax and allow more Liberty to their People.

* All Europe is on our side of the question, as far as applause  
and good wishes can carry them. Those, who live under arbitrary  
power, do nevertheless approve of liberty, and wish for it; they  
almost despair of recovering it in Europe ; they read the transla-  
tions of our separate colony institutions with rapture, and there  
are such numbers every where, who talk of removing to America  
with their families and fortunes, as soon as peace and our inde-  
pendence shall be established, that it is generally believed, we  
shall have a prodigious addition of strength, wealth, and arts, from  
the emigrations of Europe; and it is thought, that, to lessen or  
prevent such emigrations, the tyrannies established there must re-  
lax, and allow more liberty to their people. Hence it is a common  
observation here, that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and  
that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own.” p. 23.
