You tell me you sometimes visit the ancient Junto. I wish you would do it oftner. I know they all love and respect you, and regret your absenting yourself so much. People are apt to grow strange and not understand one another so well, when they meet but seldom. Since we have held that Club till we are grown grey together, let us hold it out to the End. For my own Part, I find I love Company, Chat, a Laugh, a Glass, and even a Song, as well as ever; and at the same Time relish better than I us’d to do, the grave Observations and wise Sentences of old Men’s Conversation: So that I am sure the Junto will be still as agreeable to me as it ever has been: I therefore hope it will not be discontinu’d as long as we are able to crawl together.
