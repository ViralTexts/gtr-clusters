Dear Cousin,  
London Jan. 13. 1772  
I received your kind Letter of Nov. 8. and rejoice to hear of the continued Welfare of you and your good Wife and four Daughters: I hope they will all get good Husbands. I dare say they will be educated so as to deserve them. I knew a wise old Man, who us’d to advise his young Friends to chuse Wives out of a Bunch; for where there were many Daughters, he said they improv’d each other, and from Emulation acquir’d more Accomplishments, knew more, could do more, and were not spoil’d by parental Fondness like single Children. Yours have my best Wishes, and Blessing if that can be of any Value.
