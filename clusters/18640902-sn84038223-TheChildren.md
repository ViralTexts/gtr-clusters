When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And the school for the day is dismissed,  
The little ones gather around me  
To bid me good night and be kissed;  
O! the little white arms that encircle  
My neck, in their tender embrace,  
O! the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face.  
  
And when they are gone, I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last!  
Of love that my heart will remember  
While it wakes to the pulse of the past  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin;  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
  
O! my heart grows as weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fount of my feelings will flow,  
When I think of the paths deep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er them—  
Of the tempests of Fate blowing wild,  
O! there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy,  
As the innocent heart of a child!  
  
They are idols of hearts and of households  
They are angels of God in disguise;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses;  
His glory still gleams in their eyes;  
O! those truants from home and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild;  
And I know, now, how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
  
I ask not a life for the dear one  
All radiant, as others have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayers would bound back to myself.  
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
  
The twig is so easily bended  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge  
They have taught e the goodness of God;  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness  
Where I shut the for breaking a rule,  
My frown is sufficient correction,  
My love is the law of the school.  
  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshhold no more;  
Ah! how shall I sigh for the dear ones  
That meet me each morn at the door!  
I shall miss the &quot;good-nights,&quot; and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee,  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning for me.  
  
I shall miss them at morn and at eve—  
Their song in the school and the street;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons of life are all ended,  
And death says, &quot;The school is dismissed!&quot;  
May the little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good-night and be kissed.

I ask not a life for the dear ones  
All radiant, as others have done ;

Ah, a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner mast pray for himself.  
  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To trayerse its threshold no more ;  
Ah! how I shall sigh for the dear ones  
That meet me each morn at the door;  
I shall miss the “ good-nights ” and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee ;  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning for me.

The Children..  
  
BY CHARLES DICKENS.  
  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended;

To bid me good-night and be kissed ;  
  
QO! the little white arms that encircle

O! the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face  
  
And when they are gone, I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last;  
  
Of love that my heart will remember,  
While it wakes to the pulse of the past.  
  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A. partaer of sorrow and sin ;  
  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
  
9! my heart-grows weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fountain of feelings will flow  
When I think of the paths steep and stony  
  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er them—  
Of the tempests of Fate blowing wild,  
O! there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child!  
  
They&#x27;re the idols of hearts and of households  
They&#x27;re the angels of God in disguise;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses ;  
His glory still beams in their eyes.  
O! those truants from home and from Heaven  
They have made me more manly and mild!  
And I know now, how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
  
J ask not a life for the dear ones  
All radient, as others have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
T would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayer would bound back to myself:  
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.

THE CHILDREN.  
  
The following beautiful poem 119 writ­  
ten byChaa. Dickens :  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,&quot;  
And the school for the daj is dismissed,  
And the little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good night and be kissed ;  
0 ! tho little while anus that encircle  
My neck iu a tender embrace ;  
0 1 the Mnilea that are haloes of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face.  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood too lovely to last;  
Of love that my keart will remember,  
While it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
Ere Uie world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin;  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
O ! my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fountains of feeling will flow,  
When I think of the paths steep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must no;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er them,  
Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild;  
0 ! there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child !  
They are idols of hearts and of households;  
They are angels of God iu disguise ;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
His glory still gleams in their eyes ;  
O ! those tyrants from home &amp; from heaven,  
Thry have made me more manly &amp; mild!  
And I know now how Jesus could liken  
The Kingdou of God to a child.  
1 ask not a l!f j for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as others have done ;  
But Ihat life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
I would pray God to gaurd them from evil,  
But my prayer wo&#x27;d bound hack to myself;  
AU ! a seraph may pray for a sinner.  
But a sinner must pay for himself!  
The twig is so easily liended,  
1 have banished the rule and the rod ;  
I have taught them Ihe goodness of knowl­  
edge,They have taught mo goodness of Gxl ;  
My lieart is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficient correction ;  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse

The Children.  
The following beautiful poem was written  
by Charles Dickens  
When the lessons and tasks are all endod,  
And the school for the day ia dismissed,  
And the little ones gather around me,   
To bid me good night and be kissed;  
Oh, the little white arms that encircle, if  
My neck in a tender embrace!  
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heavon,  
 Shedding sunshine of love on my face!  
And when they are gone I alt dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely tolast:  
Of love that my heart will remember,  
When it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
Ere the world and its wickedness made mn  
A partner of sorrow and sin;  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladnesa within,   
Oh, my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fountains of feeling will flow,  
When I think of the Paths, steep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er them,  
Of the tempest of fate blowing wild:  
Oh! there is nothing on sarth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child!  
They are idols of hearts and of households;  
They are angels of God in disguise; I !  
His sunlight still sleeps in their trosses,  
His glory still gleams in their eyes;  
Oh, these truants from home and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild f  
And I know how Jesus could liken! $8,74a  
The Kingdom of God to a child!   
I ask not a life for the dear ones  
All radlant, as others have done  
But that life may have just enough shadove  
To temper the glare of the sun  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
Bat my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinher must pray for himself,  
The twig is so casily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodness of kknowledgs,  
They have taught me the goodness of God;  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them for breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficlent correction  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autums,  
To traverse its threshold no more:  
Ah, how I shall sigh for the dear ones parst;  
That meet me each morn at the door!  
I shall miss the &quot;good nights&quot; and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glae,  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning to me,  
I shall miss them at morn and at evening,  
Their song in the school and the street;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of thoir delicate feet;  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And Death says, &quot;The school is dismissed!&quot;  
May the little ones gather aroand me,  
To bid me good night and he kissed,

But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
I would pray to God to guard them from evil,  
but my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah, a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner may pray for himself.  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodnes of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God;  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficient correction  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more;  
Ah, how I shall sigh for the dear ones  
That meet me each morn at the door!  
I shall miss the &quot;good nights&quot; and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee  
The groups on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning to me.  
I shall miss them at morn, and at evening  
Their song in the school and the street;  
I shall miss the hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And death says, &quot;The school is dismissed!&#x27;  
May the little ones gather around me  
To bid me good night and be kissed.

Tlio Children.  
[ The following beautiful poem was  
written by Charles Dickens:j  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And the school for the day is dis­  
missed,  
And the little ones gather around me.  
To bid me good-night and be kissed;  
Oh, the little white arms that encircle  
My neck in a tender embrace!  
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of lovo on my face!  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last;  
Of love that my heart will remember,  
When it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
Ere the world and its wickedness made  
&quot;me  
A partner of sorrow and sin :  
When the glory of God was about me.  
When the glory of gladness within.  
Oil, my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fountains of feeling will flow,  
When I think of paths, steep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must  
£°;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er  
them.  
Of tlie tempest of fate blowing wild;  
Oli, there is nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child.  
They are idols of hearts and of house­  
holds;  
They are angels of God it) disguise;  
Ilis sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
Ilis glory still gleams in their eyes;  
Oh, those truants from home and from  
heaven.  
They have made me more lftanly and  
mild!  
And 1 know how Jesus could liken  
The Kingdom of God to a child !

The Kingdom of God to a child.  
I ask not a life for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as others have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God;  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficient correction.  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more;  
Ah! how I shall sigh for the dear ones,  
That meet me each morn at the door!  
I shall miss the &quot;good nights&quot; and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee,  
The group on the green, and the flower  
That are brought every morning to me.  
I shall miss them at morn and at evening,  
Their song in the school and the street;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And death says, &quot;the school is dismissed!&quot;  
May the little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good night and be kissed

THE CHILDREN.  
  
BY CHARLES DICKENS.  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And the school for the day is dismissed,  
And the little ones gather around me,  
  
To bid me good-night and be kissed :  
Oh, the little white arms that encircle  
My neck in a tender embrace !  
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face !  
  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood too lovely to last ;  
  
Of love that my heart will remember,  
When it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin ;  
  
When the glory of God was atout me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
  
Oh, my heart grows weak as a woman’s,  
And the fountains of feeling will flow,  
  
When I think of the paths steep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go ;  
  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o’er them,  
Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild ;  
  
Oh! there’s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child!  
  
They are idols of hearts and of households ;  
They are angels of God in disguise ;  
  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
His glory still gleams in their eyes ;  
  
Oh ! those truants from home and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild!  
  
And I know how Jesus could liken .  
The Kingdom of God to a child.  
  
I ask nota life for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as others have done,  
  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun ;  
  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
  
But my prayer would bound back to myself ;  
Ab ! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
  
But a sinner must pray for himself.

For the Chilvren.  
  
THE CHILDREN.  
  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And the school for the day is dismissed,  
And the little ones apes’ around me,  
  
To bid me good-night and be kissed :  
  
O! the little white arms that encircle  
  
My neck in a tender embrace :  
  
O! the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face.  
  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood too lovely to last;  
  
Of love that my heart will remember,  
When it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin :  
  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
  
O! my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fountains of feeling will flow,  
When I think of the paths steep and strong,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o’er them,  
Of the tempest of fate blowing wild ;  
  
O |! there is nothing on earth half so holy  
  
As the innocent heart of a child.  
  
They are idols of hearts and of households ;  
They are angels of God in disguise ;  
  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
  
His glory still gleams in their eyes ;  
  
O! those truants from home and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild :  
And I know how Jesus could liken  
  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
  
I ask not a life for the dear ones,  
  
All radiant, as others have done,  
  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
  
The twig is so easily bended,  
  
I have banished the rule and the rod ;  
  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God ;  
My cent ig a dungeon of darkness,  
  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule ;  
  
My frown is sufficient correction ; ;  
  
My love is the law of the school.  
  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
  
To traverse its threshold no more ;  
  
Ah! how { shall sigh for the dear ones,  
  
That meet me each morn at the door:  
  
I shall miss the “ good-nights ” and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee,  
  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
  
That are brought every morning to me.  
  
I shall miss them at morn and at eve,  
Their song in the school and the street ;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of their delicate feet;  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And Death says “ the school is dismissed ”  
re the little ones gather around me,  
  
bid me good-night and be kissed.

They have made me more manly and mild,  
And I know how Jesus could liken  
The Kingdom of God to a child.  
I ask not a life for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as others have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun.  
I would pray God to guard them from&#x27;evil,  
But rnv prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah, a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod ;  
I have taught tnem the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God.  
My heart is a dunjeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficient correction.  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more ;  
Ah, how shall I sigh for the dear ones  
That meet me each morn at the door.  
I sliail miss the &quot;good nights&quot; and the kisses  
And the gush of their innocent glee,  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning to me.  
I shall miss them at noon and at eve,  
Their song in the school and the street ;

To bid me &quot;good night&quot; and be kissed.

Of love that my heart will remember

A partner of sorrow and sin—  
When the glory of God was about me.  
And the glory of gladness within.  
Oh my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s.  
And the fountain of feelings will How,  
When I think of the paths steep and stony  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o’er them  
Of the tempests of fate blowing wild—  
Oh there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innooent heart of a child 1  
  
They are idols of hearts and of households.  
They are angelsof God In disguise—

His glory still beams in their eyes—  
Oh those truants from earth ana from Heaven.  
They have made me more manly and mild.  
And I know now how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
  
Seek not a life for the dear ones

When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And the school for the day is dismissed,  
The little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good-night and be kissed :  
Oh, the little white arms that encircle  
My neck in their tender embrace !  
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face!  
  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last :  
  
Of joy, that my heart will remember,  
While it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me,  
  
A partner of sorrow and sin ;  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
  
All my heart grows as weak as a woman’s,  
And the fountains of feeling will flow,  
When I think of the paths steep and stony,  
  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the mountains of Sin hanging o’er them,  
Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild ;  
Oh, there’s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child !  
  
They are idols of hearts and of households ;  
They are angels of God in disguise ;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
His glory still gleams in their eyes.  
Those truants from home and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild,  
And I know now how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
  
I ask not a life for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as others have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun ;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayer would bound back to myself ;  
Ah ! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banish&#x27;d the rule and the rod ;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God ;  
My heart is the dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them for breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficient correction ;  
My love is the law of the school.  
  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more ;  
Ah ! how I shall sigh for the dear ones  
That meet me each morn at the door ;  
I shall miss the “‘ good-nights” and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee,  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning for me.  
  
I shall miss them at morn and at even,  
Their song in the school and the street ;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tread of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons of life are all ended,  
And Death says, ‘‘ The school is dismissed !”  
May the little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good-night, and be kiss’d !

THE CHILDREY.  
  
Found in the desk of Charles Dickens  
  
after his death.  
  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended.  
  
And the school for the day is dismissed  
  
And the little ones gathered around me  
  
To bid me &quot;good night&quot; and be kissed:  
  
Oh, the little white hands that encircle  
  
My neck in a tender embrace!  
  
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
  
Shedding sunshine and love on my face!  
  
And when they are gone I am dreaming,  
  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last;  
  
Of love, that my heart will remember  
  
When it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
  
Ere the world and its wickedness made  
  
mlle  
A partner of sorrow and sin,  
  
When the glory of God was about me,  
  
And the glory of gladness within,  
  
Oh, my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
  
And the fountain of feeling will flow,  
  
When I think of the path steep and stony,  
  
Where the feet of the dear ones must  
  
go,  
  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er  
  
them,  
  
Of the tempests of fate blowing wild;  
  
Oh, there&#x27;s nothing on earth halt so holy,  
  
As the innocent heart of a child.  
  
They are idols of hearts and of house  
  
holds,  
  
They are angels of God in disguise  
  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
  
His glory still beams in their eyes;  
  
Oh, those truants from earth and from  
  
heaven  
  
They have made me more manly and  
  
mild  
  
And I know how Jesus could liken  
  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
  
Seek not a life for the dear ones  
  
All radiant as others have done.  
  
But that life may have just as much  
  
shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun:  
  
I would pray God to guard them from  
  
evil,  
  
But my prayer would bound back to  
  
myself;  
  
Ah, a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
  
The twig is so easily bended,  
  
I have banished the rule and the rod  
  
I have taught them the goodness of  
  
knowlege  
  
They have taught me the goodness of  
  
God.  
  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
  
Where I shut them from breaking a  
  
rule  
  
My frown is sufficient correction,  
  
My love is the law of the school.  
  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn  
  
To traverse its old threshold no more  
  
Ah, how shall I sigh for the dear one  
  
That meet me each morn at the door,  
  
I shall miss the &quot;good-nights&quot; and the  
  
kisses  
  
And the gash of their innocent glee,  
  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
  
That are brought every morning to me.  
  
I shall miss them at morn and at eve,  
  
Their song in the school and the street  
  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices  
  
And the tramp of their delicate feet  
  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended  
  
And death says the school is dismissed,  
  
May the little ones gather around me  
  
To bid me &quot;goed-night&quot; and be kissed

Of my childhood, too lovely to last  
Of love that my heart will remember  
When it wakes to the love of the past  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin  
When the glory of God was above me  
And the glory of gladness within  
Oh, my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s  
And fountains of sorrow will flow  
When I think of the paths steep and stony  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er them  
Of the tempest of fate growing wild  
Oh, there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child  
They are idols of hearts and of household  
They are angels of God in disguise  
His sunlight still sleeps on their tresse  
His glory still beams in their eyes  
Oh, those truants from earth and from heaven  
They have made me more manly and mild  
And I now know how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child!  
I seek not a life for the dear one  
  
All radiant, as others have done  
  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
  
the sun  
  
 of  
  
tard them from evil  
  
But my prayer would bound back on myself  
  
Ah, a scraph may pray for a sinner  
  
But a sinner must pray for himself  
The twig is so easily bended  
I have banished the rule and the rod  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge  
They have taught me the goodness of God  
My heart is a dungeon of darknes  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule  
My frown is sufficient correction  
My love is the law of the school  
I shall leave the old home in the antumn  
To traverse its threshold no more  
Ah! how shall I sigh for the dear ones  
That mect me cach morn at the door,  
I shall miss the good-night and the kisses  
And the gush of their innocent glee  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning to m  
I shall miss them at morn and at even  
Their song in the school and the streets  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices  
And the tramp of their delicate feet  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended  
And Death says school is  
May the little ones gather around me  
To bid me good-night and be kissed

Little Children.  
The following beautiful little poem, from  
the pen of Charles Dickens, was found in  
his desk after his death:  
When the lessons and tasks are ended,  
And the school for the day is dismissed,  
And the little ones gather around me  
To bid me &quot;good-night&quot; and be kissed;  
Oh, the little white arms that encircle  
My neck in a tender embrace!  
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine and love on my face!  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last;  
Of love, that my heart will remember  
When it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin,  
When the glory of God was about me  
And the glory of gladness within.  
Oh, my heart grows weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fountain of feeling will flow  
When I think of the paths steep and stony  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er them,  
Of the tempests of fate blowing wild;  
Oh, there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child!  
They are idols of hearts and of household,  
They are angels of God in disguise;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
His glory still beams in their eyes;  
Oh, those truants from earth and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild,  
And I know how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
Seek not a life for the dear ones  
All radiant, as others have done.  
But that life may have just as much shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun.  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah, a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
The twig is so easily bended  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God.  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficient correction,  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,

WHO WROTE &quot;THE CHIHLOREN.&quot;  
  
A Letter from the Son of Charles Dicken  
That Ends an Old Controversy.  
There is scarcely a reader of English verse  
who has not read and admired the following  
poem, by Charles M. Dickinson, the editor of  
The Binghamton Republican. It has been  
printed again and again in American and Eng­  
lish newspapers, in many school books, and  
in nearly all collections of verse. The poem  
has been invariably credited to the author in  
books, but for several years it bas been  
widely printed in the newspapers over the  
name of Charles Dickens. Mr. Dickinson  
now gives to the public the following note  
from the son of the dead novelist  
HoteL Brunswick, NeW York,  
  
DEAR SIR-In reply to the letter which  
William Henry Smith has been good enough  
to forward to me, I willingly testify to the  
fact that the poem, &quot;The Children,&quot; which  
has so often been erroneously attributed to  
my father, was not  
written by him;  
and that, far from  
having claimed it  
as his, I have writ­  
ten during the last  
seventeen years a  
large number of  
letters, and have  
many times insert-  
ed in my magazine,  
Household Words,  
answers to corre­  
spondents stating  
that the story about  
the poem having  
been found in my  
father&#x27;s desk after  
his death was en  
tirely apocryphal, ChArLEs M. Dickinson.  
and that I was altogether unaware to whom  
the credit of the authorship of the verses was  
due. I am, dear sir, faithfully yours,  
CHARLES DICKENS.  
Charles M. Dickinson, Esq., Daily Repubk-  
can, Binghamton, N. Y.  
Cassell &amp; Co., New York, and Sampson  
Low, Marston &amp; Co., London, have just is­  
sued a very handsome volume of Mr. Dick­  
inson&#x27;s hitherto unpublished verse. The  
poem, &quot;The Children,&quot; over which there has  
been such a dispute, is as follows:  
THE CHILDREN.  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And the school for the day is dismissed,  
The little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good night and be kissed;  
Oh, the little white arms that encircle  
My neck in their tender embrace!  
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face!  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last  
Of joy that my heart will remember,  
While it wakes to the pulse of the past;  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin,  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
All my heart grows as weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fountain of feeling will flow,  
When I think of the paths steep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go  
Of the mountains of Sin hanging o&#x27;er them,  
Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild  
Oh, there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child!  
They are idols of hearts and of households;  
They are angels of God in disguise;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
His glory still gleams in their eyes;  
Those truants from home and from heaven  
They have made me more manly and mild;  
And I know now how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child!  
I ask not a life for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as others have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God;  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them for breaking a rule;  
My frown is sufficient correction;  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more;  
Ah! how I shall sigh for the dear ones,  
That meet me each morn at the door;  
I shall miss the &quot;good nights&quot; and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee,  
The greups on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning to me.  
I shall miss them at morn and at even,  
Their song in the school and the street;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tread of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons of life are all ended,  
And death says, &quot;The school is dismissed!&quot;  
May the little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good night and be kissed!  
The VIrgINia Railroad Accident.  
The recent accident on the Norfolk and  
Western railroad in Richmond, in which a  
train ran into a wash out, was one of the  
most destructive to life and property of the  
year. The cut accompanying this is from a  
sketch made for The Philadelphia Press by  
George Masters, civil engineer, of Philadel  
phia, who was a passenger on the wrecked  
train.
