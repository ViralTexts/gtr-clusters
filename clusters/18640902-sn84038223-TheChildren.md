When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And the school for the day is dismissed,  
The little ones gather around me  
To bid me good night and be kissed;  
O! the little white arms that encircle  
My neck, in their tender embrace,  
O! the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face.  
  
And when they are gone, I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last!  
Of love that my heart will remember  
While it wakes to the pulse of the past  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin;  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
  
O! my heart grows as weak as a woman&#x27;s,  
And the fount of my feelings will flow,  
When I think of the paths deep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o&#x27;er them—  
Of the tempests of Fate blowing wild,  
O! there&#x27;s nothing on earth half so holy,  
As the innocent heart of a child!  
  
They are idols of hearts and of households  
They are angels of God in disguise;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses;  
His glory still gleams in their eyes;  
O! those truants from home and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild;  
And I know, now, how Jesus could liken  
The kingdom of God to a child.  
  
I ask not a life for the dear one  
All radiant, as others have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayers would bound back to myself.  
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
  
The twig is so easily bended  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge  
They have taught e the goodness of God;  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness  
Where I shut the for breaking a rule,  
My frown is sufficient correction,  
My love is the law of the school.  
  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshhold no more;  
Ah! how shall I sigh for the dear ones  
That meet me each morn at the door!  
I shall miss the &quot;good-nights,&quot; and the kisses,  
And the gush of their innocent glee,  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning for me.  
  
I shall miss them at morn and at eve—  
Their song in the school and the street;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons of life are all ended,  
And death says, &quot;The school is dismissed!&quot;  
May the little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good-night and be kissed.

O! the little white arms that encircle  
My neck in a tender embrace :  
  
O! the smiles that are halos of heaven,  
Shedding sunshine of love on my face.  
  
And when they are gone I sit dreaming  
Of my childhood, too lovely to last;  
  
Of love that my heart will remember,  
While it wakes to the pulse of the past,  
  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin;  
  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
  
O ! my heart grows weak as a woman’s,  
And the fountains of feeling will flow,  
When I think of the paths steep and stony,  
  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  
Of the tempest of fate blowing wild;  
O! there’s nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a child.  
  
They are idols of hearts and of households ;  
They are angels of God in disguise ;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses ;  
His glory still gleams in their eyes.  
O! those truants from home and from heaven,  
They have made me more manly and mild,  
And I know now how Jesus could liken  
The Kingdom of God to a child.  
  
I ask not a life for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as others have done ;  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil  
But my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah, a seraph may pray for sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod:  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the wisdom of God :—  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule ;  
My frown is sufficient correction ;  
My love is the law of the school.  
  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more ;  
  
Ah! how I shall sigh for the dear ones,  
That meet me each morn at the door!  
  
I shall miss the “ good night” and the kisses,  
Aud the gush of their innocent glee,  
  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning to me.  
  
I shall miss them at noon and at eve—  
Their song in the school and the street ;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And Death says, “ The school is dismissed !””  
May the little ones gather around me,

That are brought every morning to me.  
I shall miss them at morn and at evening.  
Their song in the school and the street :  
I shall miss the low hum of their voice.

Of love that my heart will remember  
When it wakes to the pulse of the past ;  
Ere the world and its wickedness made me  
A partner of sorrow and sin ;  
When the glory of God was about me,  
And the glory of gladness within.  
Oh, my heart grows weak as a woman’s,  
And the fountain of feeling will flow,  
Wiien I think of the paths, steep and stony,  
Where the feet of the dear ones must go :  
Of the mountains of sin hanging o’er them;  
Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild ;  
Oh, there is nothing on earth half so holy  
As the innocent heart of a.child !  
They are idols of hearts and of households ;  
They are angels of God in disguise ;  
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
His glory still gleams in their eyes ;  
Oh, those truants from home and from heaven  
They have made me more manly and mild !  
And I know how Jesus could liken  
The.Kingdom of God to a child.  
I ask not a life for the dear ones,  
All radiant, as other have done,  
But that life may have just enough shadow  
To temper the glare of the sun ;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil,  
But my prayer would bound back to myself ;  
Ah ! a seraph may pray for a sinner,  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod ;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have tauglit me the goodness of God !  
My heart #is a dungeon of darkness,  
Where I shut them from breaking a rule I  
My frown is sufficient correction ;  
My love Is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more ;  
Ah ! how I shall sigh for the dear ones,  
That meet me each morn at the door !  
I shall miss the “good-nights” and the kisses,  
And the gush of- their .innocent glee,  
The groups on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morniug to me.,  
I shall miss them at mom and at eve,  
Their song in the school and the street;  
I shall miss the low hum of their voices!  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When tile lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And death says “The school is dismissed !”  
May the little ones gather around me,  
To bid me good-night and be kissed.

To temper the glare of the sun ;  
I would pray God to guard them from evil.  
But my prayer would bound back to myself;  
Ah ! a seraph may pray for a sinner.  
But a sinner must pray for himself.  
The twig is so easily bended,  
I have banished the rule and the rod;  
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,  
They have taught me the goodness of God.  
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,  
When I shut them for breaking a rule,  
My frown is sufficient correction,  
My love is the law of the school.  
I shall leave the old house in the Autumn,  
To traverse its threshold no more ;  
Ah 1 how I shall look for the dear ones  
That meet me each morn at the door.  
I shall miss the &quot;Good nights&quot; and the kisses  
And the gush of their innocent glee.  
The group on the green, and the flowers  
That are brought every morning to me.  
I shall miss them at noon and at even.  
Their song In the school and the street ;  
I shall miss the hum of their voices.  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons and tasks are all ended,  
And death says the school is dismissed,  
May the little ones gather around me,  
And bid me &quot;Good night&quot; and be kissed

woman&#x27;s, And the fountain of feelings  
will flow, When I think of the paths  
steep and stony, Where the feet of my  
dear ones must go ; Of the mountains of  
sin hanging o&#x27;er them, Of the tempests  
of fate blowing wild ; j Oh, there&#x27;s  
nothing on earth half so holy As the  
innocent heart of a child. They are  
idols of hearts and of households, They  
are angels of God in disguise — His  
sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,  
His elory still beams in their eyes ;  
Oh. those truants from earth and from  
Heaven, They have made me more manly and  
mild, And I know now how Jesus could  
liken The Kingdom of God to a child.  
Seek not a life for the dear ones All  
radiant, as others have done, But that  
life may have just as much shadow To ten  
oer the glare of the sun ; I would pray  
God to guard them from evil, But my  
prayer would bound back to&#x27;myself ; Ah 1  
a seraph may pvay for a sinner, But a  
sinner must pray for himself. The twig  
is so easily bended, I have banished the  
rule and the rod ; I have taught them  
the goodness of knowledge, They have  
taught me the goodness of God. My  
lio.iit i« a dungeon of darkness, Where  
I shut them for breaking a rule ; My  
frown is sufficient conviction, My iove  
is the law of the school. I shall leave  
the old house in the autumn, To traverse  
its threshold no more ; Ah ! how I shall  
sigh for the dear ones That met me each  
morn at the door. I shall miss the &#x27;  
Good nights&#x27; and the kisses, And the  
gush of their innocent glee, The group  
on the gre°n, and the flowers That are  
brought every morning to me. I sliall  
miss them at morn and at even, Their  
songs in the school and the street, I  
shall miss the low hum of their voices,  
And the tramp of their delicate feet.  
When the lessons and tasks are all  
ended, And Dea&#x27;h say
