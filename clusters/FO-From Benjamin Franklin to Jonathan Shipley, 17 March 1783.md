Let us now forgive and forget. Let each Country seek its Advancement in its own internal Advantages of Arts &amp; Agriculture, not in retarding or preventing the Prosperity of the other. America will, with God’s Blessing, become a great &amp; happy Country; and England, if she has at length gain’d Wisdom, will have gain’d something more valuable, &amp; more essential to her Prosperity, than all she has lost; and will still be a great and respectable Nation.— Her great Disease at present is the Number &amp; enormous Salaries &amp; Emoluments of Office. Avarice &amp; Ambition are strong Passions, and separately act with great Force on the human Mind; but when both are united and may be gratified in the same Object, their Violence is almost irresistable, and they hurry Men headlong into Factions and Contentions destructive of all good Government. As long therefore as these great Emoluments subsist, your Parliament will be a stormy Sea, and your public Counsels confounded by private Interests. But it requires much Public Spirit and Virtue to abolish them! more perhaps than can now be found in a Nation so long corrupted.  
Please to present my affectionate Respects to Mrs Shipley and all my young Friends, whom I long to see once more before I die. I hope soon to congratulat

the following passages will afford a tolerably fair specimen.  
  
“ Her” (England’s) “ great disease at present is the number and  
cnormous salaries and emoluments of office. Avarice and ambition  
are strong passions, and separately act with great force on the  
human mind; but when both are united and inay be gratified in  
the same object their violence is almost irresistibie, and they hur-  
&#x27;y men headlong into factions and contentions destructive of all  
good government. As long therefore as these great emoluments  
subsist, your parliament will be a stormy sea, and your public  
counsels confounded by private interests.”

Franklin in none of these letters appears  
to have gforeseen the troubles which over-
