Dear Sir,  
Passy, March 16, 1780.  
I received your kind letter of September the 22d, and I thank you for the pleasing account you give me of the health and welfare of my old friends, Hugh Roberts, Luke Morris, Philip Syng, Samuel Rhoades, &amp;c. with the same of yourself and family. Shake the old ones by the hand for me, and give the young ones my blessing. For my own part, I do not find that I grow any older. Being arrived at 70, and considering that by travelling further in the same road I should probably be led to the grave, I stopped short, turned about and walked back again; which having done these four years, you may now call me 66. Advise those old friends of ours to follow my example, keep up your spirits and that will keep up your bodies, you will no more stoop under the weight of age than if you had swallowed a handspike.

For my own part, I do not find that I grow any  
older. Being arrived at seventy, and considering  
that by travelling farther in the same road I  
should probably be led to the grave, I stopped  
short, turned about, and walked back again; which  
done these four years, you may now call me  
sixty-six. Advise these old friends of ours to  
follow my example; keep up your spirits, and that  
will keep up your bodies; you will no more stoop  
under the weight of age than if you had swallowed  
a handspike.
