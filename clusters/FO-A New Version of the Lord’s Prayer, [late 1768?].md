need of his forgiveness. He also teaches sinners that they  
have an interest in their heavenly Father’s love, and that by  
the strength of that interest his favor may be asked. They

On a subsequent occasion the disciples  
came to Jesus, and said to him: * Lord,  
teach us how to pray, as John also taught  
his disciples’’; and in answer to them he  
aaid, as reported in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, chapter  
ii, 2-4:  
  
“When ye pray, say, Our Father, which art
