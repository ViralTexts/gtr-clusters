Passy, July 26. 1781  
I have just received your very friendly Letter of the 6th of June past, announcing your Appointment to the Superintendance of our Finances. This gave me great Pleasure, as from your Intelligence, Integrity and Abilities, there is reason to hope every Advantage that the Publick can possibly receive from such an Officer. You are wise in estimating beforehand, as the principal Advantage you can expect, the Consciousness of having done Service to your Country. For the Business you have undertaken is of so complex a Nature, and must engross so much of your Time &amp; Attention, as necessarily to hurt your private Interests; and the Publick is often niggardly even of its Thanks, while you are sure of being censured by malevolent Criticks and Bug Writers, who will abuse you while you are serving them, and wound your Character in nameless Pamphlets, thereby resembling those little dirty stinking Insects, that attack us only in the dark, disturb our Repose, molesting &amp; wounding us while our Sweat &amp; Blood is contributing to their Subsistence. Every Assistance that my Situation here as long as it continues may enable me to afford you, shall certainly be given: For besides my Affection for the glorious Cause we are both engag’d in, I value myself upon your Friendship, and shall be happy if mine can be made of any Use to you. With great &amp; sincere Esteem, I am ever, Dear Sir

* Dear Srr—I have just received your  
very friendly letter of the 6th of June past,  
announcing your appointment to the super-  
intendence of our finances, This gives  
me great pleasure, as from your intelli-  
gence, apeogeity and abilities, there is every  
reason to hope every advantage that the  
public can possibly receive from such an  
office. You are wise in estimating, be-  
forehand, as the principal advantage you  
are to expect, the consciousness of having  
done service to your country. For the  
business you have undertaken is of so com-  
plex a nature, and must engross so much  
of your time and attention, as necessarily  
to hurt your private interests; and the  
public often niggardly even of its thanks,  
while you are sure of being censured by  
malevolent critics, who will abuse you  
while you are serving them, and wound  
your character in nameless pamphlets,  
thereby resembling those little, dirty,  
stinking insects that attack only in the  
dark, disturb our repose, molesting and  
wounding us, while our sweat and blood  
are contributing to their subsistence. Eve-  
ry assistance that my situation here, so  
long as it continues, may enable me to  
afford you, shall certainly be given. For,  
besides my affection for the glorious cause  
we are both engaged in, I value myself up-  
on your friendship, and shall be happy if  
mine can be any use to you. With great  
and sincere esteem, I am ever, dear sir,
