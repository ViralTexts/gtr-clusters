, and seeking an Equilibrium, I imagine some Bodies are better fitted by Nature to be Conductors of that Fluid than others; and that generally those which are the best Conductors of the Electrical Fluid, are also the best Conductors of this; and e contra. Thus a Body which is a good Conductor of Fire readily receives it into its Substance, and conducts it thro’ the Whole to all the Parts; as Metals and Water do; and if two Bodies, both good Conductors, one heated, the other in its common State, are

r enclin’d to think that the Fluid, Fire, as well as the Fluid, Air, is attracted by Plants in their Growth, and becomes consolidated with the other Materials of which they are formed, and makes a great Part of their Substance. That when they come to be digested, and to suffer in the Vessels a Kind of Fermentation, Part of the Fire as well as Part of the Air, recovers its fluid Active State again, and diffuses itself in the Body digesting and separating it. That the Fire so reproduc’d by Digestion and Separation, continually leaving the Body, its Place is supply’d by fresh Quantities arising from the continual Separation. That whatever quickens the Motion of the Fluids in an Animal, quickens the Separation, and reproduces more of the Fire, as Exercise. That all the Fire emitted by Wood and other Combustibles when burning, existed in them before in a solid State, being only discovered when separating. That some Fossils, as Sulphur, Seacoal, &amp;c. contain a great deal of solid Fire; that Gunpowder is almost all solid Fire: And that, in short, what escapes and is dissipated in the Burning of Bodies, besides Water and Earth, is generally the Air and Fire that before made Parts of the solid. Thus I imagin that Animal Heat arises by or from a Kind of Fermentation in the Juices of the Body, in the same Manner as Heat arises in the Liquors preparing for Distillation; wherein there is a Separation of the spirituous from the watry and earthy Parts. And it is remarkable, that the Liquor in a Distiller’s Vat, when in its highest and best State of Fermentation, shows by the Thermometer, as I have been informed, the same Degree of Heat with the human Body, that is about 94 or 96. Thus, as by a constant Supply of Fuel in a Chimney, you keep a warm Room, so by a constant Supply of Food in the Stomach, you keep a warm Body.

w if the Quantity of Fire before contain’d or diffus’d in the Snow and Salt, was expell’d in the Uniting of the two Matters, it must be driven away either thro’ the Air or the Vessel containing them. If it is driven off thro’ the Air, it must warm the Air, and a Thermometer held over the Mixture without touching it, would discover the Heat by the Rising of the Mercury, as it must and always does in warmer Air. This indeed I have not try’d; but I should guess it would rather be driven off thro’ the Vessel, especially if the Vessel be Metal, as being a better Conductor than Air, and so one should find the Bason warmer after such Mixture. But on the contrary the Vessel grows cold, and even Water in which the Vessel is sometimes plac’d for the Experiment, freezes into hard Ice on the Bason. Now I know not how to account for this otherwise than by supposing, that the Composition is a better Conductor of Fire than the Ingredients separately, and like the Lock compar’d with the Wood, has a stronger Power of Attracting Fire, and does accordingly attract it suddenly from the Fingers or a Thermometer put into it, from the Bason that contains it, and from the Water in contact with the Outside of the Bason, so that the Fingers have the Sensation of extream Cold, by being depriv’d of much of their natural Fire; the Thermometer sinks, by having part of its Fire drawn out of the Mercury; the Bason grows colder to the Touch, as by having its Fire drawn into the Mixture, it is become more capable of drawing and receiving it from the Hand; and thro’ the Bason the Water loses its Fire that kept it fluid, so it becomes Ice. One would expect, That from all this attracted Acquisition of Fire to the Composition, it should become warmer; and in fact, the Snow and Salt dissolves at the same Time into Water without freezing.  
  
I doubt whether in all this

In another part of this Jetter the Author gives his opinion  
concerning the nature of that myfterious element, fire. All  
the fire emitted by wood and other combuftible bodies, when  
burning, he fuppofes to have exifted in them before, zz a folid  
ftate, being only difcovered in the act of feparation : that ful-  
phur and fea-coal, for inftance, contain a great quantity, and  
that fome other bodies almoft intirely confift of /clid fire; and  
that, in fhort, ¢ what efcapes and is diffipated in the burning  
of bodies, befides water and earth’ (to which the Author might  
have added fome other more volaiile principles) ¢ is generally  
the air and fire that before made parts of the folid.” ina fub-  
fequent letter, after enumerating the various ways by which fire  
is kindled, or heat produced, by the chemical or mechanical  
action of bodies on cach other, he infers that the fire probably  
exifted in thefe bodies, though in a quiefcent itate, before i

+ { am inclined to think, fays the Author, that the fluid fire,  
as well as the fluid air, is attraéted by plants in their growth,  
and becomes con/olidated with the other materials of which they  
are formed, and makes a great part of their fubffance: that  
when they come to be digefted, and to fuffer in the veflels a  
kind of fermentation, part of the fire, as well as part of the  
air, recovers its fluid active ftate again, aad diffufes itfelf in the  
body, digefting and feparating it: that the fire fo reproduced,  
by digeftion and feparation, continually leaving the body, its  
place is fupplied by frefh quantities, arifing from the continual  
feparation : that whatever quickens the motion of the fluids in  
an animal, quickens the feparation, and reproduces more of the  
fire; as exercife, &amp;c.—Thus I[ imagine that animal heat arifes  
by or from a kind of fermentation in the juices of the body, in  
the fame manner as heat arifes in the liquors preparing for di-  
ftiilation, wherein there is a feparation of the {pirituous from  
the watry and earthy parts.——And it is remarkable that the  
liquor in a diftiller’s vat, when in its higheft and beft ftate of  
fermentation, as 1 have been informed, has the fame degree of  
heat with the human body ; that is, about 94 or 96.’—~* Thus,  
as by a conftant fupply of fuel in a chimney, you keep a warm  
room, fo, by a conitant fupply of food in the ftomach, you  
keep a warm body.’—

fhould find the bafon warmer after fuch mixture.’ But, on the  
comrary, the veflel grows cold, and even water in which the  
veflel is fometimes placed for the experiment, freezes into hard  
ice on the bafon. Now I know not how to account for this,  
otherwife than by fuppofing that the compofition is a better  
conduélor of fire than the ingredients feparately,—and has a  
{tronger power of attracting fire, and does accordingly atira&amp;  
it fuddenly from the fingers, or a thermometer put into it, from  
the bafon that contains it, and from the water in conta&amp; with  
the outfide of the bafon ; fo thatthe fingers have the fenfation  
of extreme cold, by being deprived of much of their natural  
fire; the thermometer finks, by having part of its fire drawn  
out of the mercury ; the bafon grows colder to the touch, as  
by having its fire drawn into the mixture, it is become more  
capable of drawing and receiving it from the hand ; and through  
the bafon, the water lofes its fire that kept it fluid, fo it becomes  
ice.— One would expect that from all this attracted acquifition of  
fire to the compofition, it {hould become warmer ; and, in fad,  
the fnow and falt diflolve at the fame time into water, without  
freezing.’
