Passy, near Paris, Decr 22. 1779.  
I have received a Letter from M. De Chezaulx, Consul of France at Berghen in Norway, acquainting me that two Ships, viz. the Betsey and the Union, Prizes taken from the English on their Coasts, by Capt. Landais, Commander of the Alliance Frigate, appertaining to the United States of North America, which Prizes having met with bad Weather at Sea, that had damaged their Rigging and occasioned Leaks, and being weakly mann’d, had taken Shelter in the supposed neutral Port of Berghen, in order to repair their Damages, procure an additional Number of Sailors, and the necessary Refreshments; That they were in the sd Port enjoying as they conceived, the common Rights of Hospitality, establish’d and practis’d by civiliz’d Nations, under the Care of the above said Consul, when on the 28th of Oct last, the said Ships with their Cargoes and Papers were suddenly seized by Officers of his Majesty the King of Denmark, to whom the said Port belongs, the American Officers &amp; Seamen turn’d out of their Possession, &amp; the whole deliver’d to the English Consul.  
M. De Chezaulx has also sent me the following/ as a Translation of his Majesty’s Order, by which the above Proceedings are said to be authorized, viz.

ses; c’est pourquoi les dits deux Navires seront sans retardement declarés libres, et auront la Liberte de partir avec leur Chargements.”  
  
By a subsequent Letter from the same Consul, I am informed that a third Prize belonging to the United States, viz: the Charming Polly, which arrived at Berghen after the others, has also been seized and delivr’d up in the same Manner; and that all the People of the three Vessels after being thus stript of their Property (for every one of them had an Interest in the Prizes) were turned on Shore to shift for themselves, without Money in a strange Place, no Provision being made for their Subsistance or for sending them back to their Country.  
Permit me, Sir; to observe on this Occasion, that the United States of America have no War but with the English, they have never done any Injury to other Nations, particularly none to the Danish Nation. On the Contrary they are in some Degree its Benefactors, as they have open’d a Trade of which the English made a Monopoly, and of which the Danes may now have their Share; and by dividing the British Empire have made it less dangerous to its Neighbours. They conceived that every Nation whom they had not offended was by the Rights of Humanity their Friend; they confided in the Hospitality of Denmark, and thought themselves and their Property safe when under the Roof of his Danish Majesty. But they find themselves stript of that Property, and the same given up to their Enemies, on this Principle only, that no Acknowledgement had yet been formally made by Denmark of the Independance of the United States. Which is to say, that there is no Obligation of Justice towards any Nation with whom a Treaty promising the same has not been previously made. This was indeed the Doctrine of ancient Barbarians, a Doctrine long since exploded, and which it would not be for the Honour of the present Age to revive, and it is hoped that Denmark will not by supporting &amp; persisting in this Decision, obtained of his Majesty apparently by Surprise, be the first Modern Nation that shall attempt to revive it. “Les Anciens, (s

s sont Freres.”  
An Injustice of the same kind done a Century or two since by some English in the East Indies, Grotius tells us “ne manquoit pas de Partisans, qui soutenoient que par les Anciennes Loix d’Angleterre on ne punissoit point en ce Royaume les Outrages commis contre les Etrangers, quand il n’y avoit point d’Alliance contracté avec eux.” But this Principle he condemns in the strongest Terms (Hist. des Troubles des Pais bas Liv. 16.—)  
The United States oppress’d by and in War with one of the most powerful Nations of Europe, may well be supposed incapable in their present infant State of exacting Justice from other Nations not disposed to grant it; but it is in human Nature that Injuries as well as Benefits received in Times of Weakness and Distress, national as well as personal, make deep and lasting Impressions; and those Ministers are wise who look into Futurity, and quench the first Sparks of Misunderstanding between two Nations, which neglected may in time grow into a Flame, all the Consequences whereof no human Prudence can foresee, which may produce much Mischief to both, and cannot possibly produce any good to either.  
I beg leave through your Excellency, to submit these Considerations to the Wisdom and Justice of his Danish Majesty, whom I infinitely respect, and who I hope will reconsider and repeal the Order above recited; and that if the Prizes, which I hereby reclaim in behalf of the United States of America, are not actually gone to England, they may be stopt &amp; redelivered to M. De Chezaulx, the Consul of France at Berghen, in whose Care they before were, with Liberty to depart for America when the Season shall permit. But if they should be already gone to England, I must then claim from his Majesty’s Equity the Value of the said three Prizes which is estimated at 50,000£ Sterling, but which may be regulated by the best Information that can by any means be obtained.  
With the greatest Respect, I am, Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient &amp; most humble Servant.

Pussy, near Paris, December 21, 1779.  
  
Sin—I have received a letter from M. de Che-  
  
zaulx, consul of France at Bergen in Norway, ac-  
  
quainting me that two ships, viz. the Betsy and  
  
the Union, prizes taken from the English on their  
  
and occasioned Jeaks, and being weakly manned,  
had taken shelter in the supposed neutral port of  
Bergen, in order to repair their damages, procure  
an additional number of sailors, and the necessary  
refreshments; that they were in the said port enjoy-  
ing, as they conceived, the common rights of bos  
pitality, established and practised by civilized na-  
tions, under the care of the above said cousui, when,  
on the 28th of October last, the said ships, with  
their cargoes and papers, were suddenly seized  
by officers of his majesty the king of Denmark, to  
whom the said port belongs, the American officers  
and seamen turned out of their possession, and the  
whole delivered to the English consul. M. Che-  
zaulx has also sent me the following, as a transla-  
tion of his mujesty’s order, by which the above  
proceedings are saidto be authorised, viz:

these vessels for this reason cannot be considered  
as good and lawful prizes; therefore the said two  
ships shall be immediately liberated and allowed  
to depart with their cargoes.” _  
  
By a subsequent letter from the sam= consul, I  
am informed, that a third prize, belonging to the  
United States, viz. Charming Polly, which arrived  
at Bergen after the others, has also been seized  
and delivered up in the same manner, and that all  
the people of the three vessels, after being thus  
stript of their property (for every one of them had  
an interest in the prizes) were turved on shore to  
shift for themselves, without money, in a strange  
place, no provision being made for their subsis-  
tence, or for sending them back to their country.  
Permit me, sir, to observe on this occasion, that the  
United States of America, have no war but with  
the English; they have never done any injury to  
others, particularly none to the Danish nation. On  
  
—7  
  
the contrary they are in some degree its benefac-  
tors, as they have opened a trade of which the Eng-  
lish made a monopoly, and of which the Danes may  
now have their share, and b  
empire, have made it less dangerous to its neigh-  
bors. They conceived that every nation whoin they  
bad not offended, was bf the rights of humanity  
their friend; they confided in the hospitality of Den-  
mark, and thought themselves and their property  
sete, when under the roof of his Danish majesty.  
But they find themselves stript of that property  
and the same given up to their enemies, on this prin.  
ciple only, that no acknowledgment had yet been  
formerly made by Denmark of the independence of  
the United States: which is to say, that there is no  
obligation of justice towards any nation, with whom  
a treaty promising the same, has: not been previous.  
ly made. This was indeed the doctrine of ancient  
barbarians, a doctrine long since exploded, and  
which it would not be for the honor of the present  
age to revive, and it is hoped that Denmark will&#x27;not,  
by supporting and persisting in this decision, ob-  
tained of his majesty apparently by supprize, be  
the first modern nation to revive it* The United  
Siates oppressed by, and at war. with one of the  
most powerful nations of Europe, may well be sup-  
posed incapable in their present infant state of exact-  
iag justice from other nations not disposed to grant  
  
benefits received, in times of weakness and distress,  
national as well as personal, make deep and lasting  
impressions; and those ministers aré wise who look  
into futurity, and quench the first sparks of misun-  
derstanding between two nations, which, if neglect-  
ed, may, in time, grow into a flame, all the conse-  
quences whereof no human prudence can foresee,  
which may produce much mischief to both, and  
cannot possibly produce any good to either: I beg  
leave through your-excellency to submit these con-  
siderations to the wisdom and justice of his Danish  
majesty, whom L infinitely respect, and who I hope  
will reconsider and repeal the order above recited:  
and that if the prizes, which I hereby reclaim in be-  
half of the United States of America, are not ac-  
tually gone to England, they may be stopped and  
re-delivered to M. de Chezauix, the consul of  
France, at Bergen; in whose care they befure were,  
with liberty to depart for America when the season  
;shall permit. But if they should be already gone  
to England, I must then claim from his majesty’s  
equity, the value of the said three prizes, which is  
estimated at ‘fifty thousand pounds sterling, but  
which may be regulated by the best information,  
that can by amy means be obtsined. With great  
respect, &amp;c, — B. FRANKLIN,  
Minister plenipotentiary of the United States of  
America at the court of France.

the same kind, done a century or two since, by Some  
English in the East Indies, Grotius tells us was not
