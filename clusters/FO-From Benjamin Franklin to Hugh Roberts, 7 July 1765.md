y in my Absence.  
I wish you would continue to meet the Junto, notwithstanding that some Effects of our publick Political Misunderstandings may some times Appear there. ’Tis now prehaps one of the oldest Clubs, as I think it was formerly one of the best, in the Kings Dominions: it wants but about two Years of Forty since it was establish’d; We loved and still Love one another, we are Grown Grey together and yet it is to Early to Part. Let us Sit till the Evening of Life is spent, the Last Hours were allways the most joyous; when we can Stay no Longer ’tis time enough then to bid each other good Night, separate, and go quietly to bed.

1765, he says: “I wish you would continue to meet the Junto, not-  
withstanding that some effects of our political misunderstanding may  
sometimes appear there. It is now perhaps one of the oldest clubs,  
as I think it was formerly one of the best, in the king’s dominions.

In May, 1765, Hugh Roberts writes as follows to Dr Franklin:—  
‘‘T sometimes visit the worthy remains of the ancient Junto, for whom  
I have a high esteem; but alas, the political, polemical divisions have  
in some measure contributed to lessen that harmony we there for-  
merly enjoyed.” To this letter, Franklin answers in July following,  
urging his friend’s attendance at the Junto, almost in the same terms  
used some years before, and which we have just quoted, and then  
closes his exhortation in the following touching words :—“ We loved  
and still love one another. We are grown gray together, and yet it  
is too early to part. Let us sit till the evening of life is spent. The  
last hours are always the most joyous. When we can stay no  
longer, it is time enough then to bid each other good night, separate,  
and go quietly to bed.”
