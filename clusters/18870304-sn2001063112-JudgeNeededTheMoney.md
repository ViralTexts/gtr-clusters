**The Judge Needed the Money**  
  
I have just heard the following good story on Chief Justice Bleckley. All who know Judge Bleckley and recall his long waving hair and beard will appreciate the story. Judge Bleckley was on his way to the Supreme Court one morning when he was accosted by a little street gamin, with an exceedingly dirty face, with the customary &quot;Shine, sir?&quot;  
  
He was quite importunate, and the Judge, being impressed with the oppressive untidiness of the boy&#x27;s face, said: I don&#x27;t want a shine, but if you will go wash your face I&#x27;ll give you a dime.&quot;  
  
&quot;All right sir.&quot;  
  
&quot;Well, let me see you do it.&quot;  
  
The boy went over to an artesian hydrant and made his ablution. Returning, he held out his hand for the dime.  
  
The Judge said, &quot;Well, sir, you&#x27;ve earned your money; here it is.&quot;  
  
The boy said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want your money, old fellow; you take it an have your hair cut.&quot; Saying which he scampered off.—*Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle*.

These bring the subject across the Atlantic and down

I saw hoWy things looked I hesitated. I  
tried to get my customer, but3he had  
suddenly left town and could not be  
reached. If I bought perhaps he would  
blame me if there was a loss, while tn  
the other hand if the rebels were beaten  
back the shares would surely rise in  
value, and then I would be censured for  
not acting accordi:lg to orders. I went  
up to the board room and found they  
were offering reams of stock for almost  
nothing. I risked the chances and  
bought all that was offered. I loaded  
up with it. How much did I maket

The Judge and the Bootklack.?A!  
judge, who used to wear very long, waving  
hair, and a heavy beard, one day was on his  
way to court, when he was acccosted by a &#x27;  
little street bootblack, with an exceedingly  
dirty face, with the customary &quot;Shine, sir?&quot; j  
He was very importunate, and, the judge  
being impressed with the terrible state of the  
hoy&#x27;s face, said:  
&quot;I don&#x27;t want a shine, but if you&#x27;ll go and  
wash your face I&#x27;ll give you 10 cents.&quot;  
&quot;All right, sir.&quot;  
&quot;Well, let me see you do it.&quot;  
The boy went over to a neighboring fountain  
and made his ablution.  
Returning, he held out his hand for the 10  
cents. The judge said :  
&quot;Well, vou&#x27;ve earned vour money. Here!  
it is.&quot;  
The boy said : &quot;I don&#x27;t want your money,  
old fellow. You take it and have your hair  
cut,&quot; and forthwith scampered oil&#x27;
