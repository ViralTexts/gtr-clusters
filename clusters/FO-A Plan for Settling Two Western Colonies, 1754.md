The great country back of the Apalachian mountains, on both sides the Ohio, and between that river and the lakes; is now well known both to the English and French, to be one of the finest in North America, for the extreme richness and fertility of the land; the healthy temperature of the air, and mildness of the climate; the plenty of hunting, fishing, and fowling; the facility of trade with the Indians; and the vast convenience of inland navigation or water-carriage by the lakes and great rivers, many hundred of leagues around.  
From these natural advantages it must undoubtedly (perhaps in less than another century) become a populous and powerful dominion; and a great accession of power, either to England or France.  
The French are now making open encroachments on these territories, in defiance of our known rights; and, if we longer delay to settle that country, and suffer them to possess it, these inconveniences and mischiefs will probably follow:  
1. Our people, being confined to the country between the sea and the mountains, cannot much more increase in number; people increasing in proportion to their room and means of subsistence. (See the Observations on the Increase of Mankind, &amp;c. p. 1)  
2. The French will increase much more, by that acquired room and plenty of subsistence, and become a great people behind us.  
  
3. Many of our debtors, and loose English people, our German servants, and slaves, will probably desert to them; and increase their numbers and strength, to the lessening and weakening of ours.  
4. They will cut us off from all commerce and alliance with the western Indians, to the great prejudice of Britain, by prevent

Appalachian mountains must become, perhaps in another  
century, a populous and powerful dominion, and a great ac-  
cession of power to either England or France. If the Eng-  
lish delay to settle that country, great inconveniences and  
mischiefs will arise. Confined to the region between the sea  
and the mountains, they can not much more increase in num-  
bers owing to lack of room and subsistence. The French  
will increase much more, and become a great people in the  
rear of the English. He therefore recommends that the  
English take immediate possession of the country, and pro-  
ceed at once to plant two strong colonies, one on the Ohio  
and one on Lake Erie. The new colonies will soon be full  
of people; they will prevent the disasters sure to follow if the  
French are allowed to have their way in the West; the Ohio  
country will be a good base for operations against Canada and  
Louisiana in case of war; the new colonies will promote the  
increase of Englishmen, of English trade, and of Englis
