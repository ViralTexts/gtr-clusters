Nasby on the New Departure.**  
  
[From the Toledo Blade.]  
  
Confederate X Roads, (wich iz in the State of Kentucky, May 24, 1871)  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the politikle field satisfied me, some months ago, that without some shift in the position uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedingly thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Vallandygham into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisiy uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand even so sudden a change ez that! Wat I want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin outside the offices uv assessor and collector are actooatid by the same high and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so simple a process ez passin resolooshens indoose enuff dissatisfied Republikins in the close Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic President who will give us these boons, we three are for passin these resolooshens no matter what they are. This bein my understandin uv Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it to wunst.  
  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Corners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That I mite get em all at one time, I waited till the regler evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good humor and ready to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very short but a very satisfactry consultashen. There wuz some objickshuns on the part uv Dimocratic idees, but Bascom settled their hash in very short metre. He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the offfises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the fullest freedom uv though and ackshen, and that every one shood express hisself untrammeled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him on that question, let him make hisself known. No sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to object dropt ez though they hed bin shot.  
  
It wuz determined to hold a public meetin the next nite at the church to make a public endorsement uv Vallandygum&#x27;s idees.  
  
Ez the principal objict uv the meetin wuz to convins the Republikins uv the doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the South really accepted the situashun, and ment, in ded ernest, to recognize the great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to hev all the niggers uv the Corners present, and saved for them the best seats in the ouse. Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I coodent help.  
  
I opened the exercises by making a short speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the time hed finally arriv when the lion and the lamb hed lain down together, and a small child wuz leading uv em. I knowed thet our colored fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yoosed, and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North, Vallandygum, hed spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy, and from this time henceforth and forever there wuz to be nothin but peece. I then offered the follerin resolooshen:  
  
&quot;*Resolved*, That the Dimocrisy uv the Yoonited States recognize the legality uv all the amendments made to the Constitooshen dooring and since the late onpleasantnis, and that they recognise and most heartily acquiesce in all the results uv the war; that they not only withdraw all their opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, but pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively by the Caucashen.&quot;  
  
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev been well hed I stopped there, but I didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekness is to slop over, and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, in a spasm of delite, &quot;preset at this meetin twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin descent. Let em step forred on this platform--let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Issaker Gavitt, and eighteen other white citizens step forred also. Let them clasp each other by the hand while I wave over em a flag uv our common kontry.&quot;  
  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers stepped forred, the whites designated advanced, the two lines grasped each other by the hand, and I was about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize. He begged me to wait a minnit till he made his remark. The site afore him moved him almost to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz generous.  
  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for ther ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern paper--alas! the Republikin party is split into fragments--remarkably small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by the Republikins uv Philadelfy on his way home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany, and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz called a convenshen, and the Noo York *Triboon* throws up the sponge and sez that nothin under the hevin can prevent the success uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, no matter who he may be or wat platform he is put onto. In view uv the disolooshen uv the Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no perteckers, it&#x27;s really generous that yoo--&quot;  
  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces! hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends in korious.  
  
&quot;It hez!&quot; responded Bigler.  
  
&quot;Then,&quot; said Deekin Pogram, his eyes flashin with unwonted fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss?&quot;  
  
And with a strength and activity which I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin fecht the darkey whose hand he hed bin graspin, a most powerful blow atween the eyes which histed him clean off the platform, the others followed soot, and in their zeal sprang off the platform after em, and wuz a executin war dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto their prostrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from takin uv em out and hanging uv em.  
  
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen wuz recinded, and others adopted affirm our adherence to the constitooshen ez it yoost to be, the illegality uv the amendments, and the nateral soopremacy uv the white man over the d--d nigger, after wich we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom, and there organized fresh raids onto our nateral enemies.  
  
The next morning I noticed a pecoolyer look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the nigger postmaster, bust into a roar ez I walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded the reason for his hilarity.   
  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Biglers,&quot; returned he, laughing louder than before.  
  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turning pale, for a suspishen was creepin over me.  
  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and--&quot;  
  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the Republikin party North wuz one uv his infernal lies!&quot;  
  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case!&quot; replied the nigger, showin all his ivories. &quot;Bigler want to see ef yoor &#x27;pentance wuz genoeine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob it. He sprest a desire to assertane jist how peeceable yood be to de nigger and de Northern people down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no &#x27;Publikin party up North to hold yoo; dat wuz all.&quot;  
  
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.  
  
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out all that he wanted to. Uv cours this &#x27;outrage,&#x27; ez they call it, will get into the Northern papers, and uv cours Vallandygum&#x27;s assershun will explode itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Bigler iz my evil genius. I shel never be able to run things ez i want to so long ez he lives.

cessful in thdr hanging and bcrnlc. they&#x27;d be  
in good humor and ready to adopt anything I  
ehcod suggest. It wuz a very short but a  
very taiicftctory conaultashen. There was  
I come cbjickshuna on the part uv a few  
;to wat they called an abandonment  
i nv Democratic idtaa, hat Bascoa settled  
| their hath in very short meter, felle  
remarkt that it wuz necessary that the  
offices bo in the bands uv his I&#x27;riends for  
obvins reasons. He wantid pay and be

lec-ved in the fuileet freedom uv thought and

I idiot. If there wuz any one in that assem­  
blage so stoopid as to differ with him on this  
question, let him make Imeelf known. No

It wuz determined to hold a public media

I opened the exercises bv making a abort  
speech cz I took the chair. I rejoist that the  
time bed finally arriv when the lion and the  
lamb bed layed down together and a email  
child was a leadin uv em. I knowd that onr  
colored follow-citizens bed bin dispitofully  
yoof&#x27;Od, and that doo respeck bed sot bin alluz  
paid to car fellow-citiiens uv the North, but  
j that time bed now passed and I hoped forev­  
er. The Dimocrisv uv the North, through  
| Vallandygxm, bed spoke, tbev bed accepted  
i the situasben, from this time  
henceforth and forever ’there wuz to bo noth­  
in but recce:  
Arjt.tfrrd. That tfco Dlmocrisv of the Yo&gt;  
i cited States recognize the legality uv all the  
amendments made to the coustitocsben dcor.n

I put the question ez to the adopsbeu uv

CONFEDRIT X ROADS.  
  
(wich is in the State of Kentucky,  
  
May 25, 1871.  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey  
uv the politikle field satisfied me,  
tome months ago, that without some  
shift in the position of the Dimocracy,  
oar how uv success wuz exceedingly  
thin. The rezolooshens interdoost by  
Vallandygum into the Convenshun of  
the Dimocracy uv aionigumery coun­  
ty, Ohio, wuz to me a new lite. Troo,  
thev have the slite disadvantage uv  
abloorin everthlng that is Dimocratic,  
and uv tuttin the Dimocratic party  
on purely .Republican ground, but wat  
uv that 7 1 kin 8 tan a even so suaain  
a change ez that. Wat I want is the  
soopreme happiness uv kickin that  
nigger Lubbock out nv the postofSs at  
the Corners, ana uv puiun myseu in  
his place, and Kernal McPelter and  
Elder Pennibacker who hev bin lan-  
guittbin outside the offises nv Assessor  
and Collector, are actooatid by the  
same hieh and holy impulses. Ef to  
do this requires the ockepyin of Ke-  
nublickin around, tne war cry uv us  
three is &quot;ockepy.&quot; Kentucky is shoor  
to go Democratic anyhow, and if we  
kin by so simple a process ez passin  
resoioosbens indoose enun aissausnea  
BeDublicklns in the close Northern  
states to rote with us to elect a Dimo  
cratic President who will give us these  
boons, we three are for passin tnese  
resoioosbens no matter what they are.  
This being my understands uv Val­  
landygnm&#x27;s movement, I acted onto it  
to wunst.  
I got the leadin Dimocracy uv the  
Corners, together one n i te at Bascom&#x27;s.  
Tnat 1 mite git em an at one time

thev&#x27;d been successful in their hanidn  
and burn in they&#x27;d be in good humor  
and ready to adopt anytinncr i snooa  
ufcesL It was a very short consul  
taxhun but very satisfactry. There  
wuz some objecahuns on the part of a  
few to what they called an abandon  
ment nv Dimocratic ideas, but Bas  
com settled their hash in very shaft  
meter. He remarkt that it wuz neces  
sary that the offises be in the hands of  
his friends lor odvious reasons, lie  
wantid pay and he knowed uv no oth  
er war to rit it. He believed in the  
fullest freedom uv thought and act  
sben. and that every one shood ex  
press himself untrameled, but he  
coodn&#x27;t abide a idiot. If there wuz  
any one in theassemblitre so stupid ez  
to difler with him on this question, let  
him make nisaeit Known, rso sich  
man ever shood Bit a drop at his bar.  
never: sich a man wnz not deservin  
uv even the commonest necessaries uv  
life. Several who had riz to their feet  
to obiect, dropt ez though they hed  
bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public

dyeum&#x27;s idea.  
tne prinsinie od ick oi me meet

tiie doubtful States that the Dimocra  
cv uv the South really acceptid the  
situashen, and ment, in dead earnest,  
to recornlze Ui irreat principle uv  
equality. I arranged to have all the  
nircers uv the Corners present, and  
saved for em the best seats in the  
house Joe. Bigler and Pollock come,  
uv course, wich I coodn&#x27;t help.  
I opened the exercises by makiu  
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-  
a leaden uv em. I knowd that our  
colored fellow-citizens hed been dis-  
pitefully yoosed, and that doo respeck  
tied not been alluz paid to our fellow-  
citizens of the North, but that time  
hed now passed and I hoped forever.  
The Dimocracy of the North, through  
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they hed  
accepted the situashen, halleloogy.and  
irom mis lime nenceiortn and toreve&#x27;  
there;wua to be nothing but peece. I  
then offered thefollerin resolooshen:  
Heolved, That the Dimocrisy of the  
Yoonlted States recognize the legality  
uv all the amendments made to the  
Constitooshen door in and since the  
onpleasantnis, and most heartily ac  
quiesce in all the results uv the war  
that they not only withdraw all their  
oppossihen to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that eur  
Airikin fellow-citizens hev not only  
this right but all others heretofore en­  
joyed excloosively by the Caucaben.  
I put the question ez to the adop  
uui uv uie raKuoosneen, ana ll wuz  
carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev  
bin well bed I stopped here, but I  
didn&#x27;t. My prevaiiu weekness is to  
slop over and I slopt on this okkashen  
leariuiiy. l called upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to prove their faith bv  
their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said in a  
spasm of delite, present at this meet  
in iwetiy-two uv our fellow-citizens

Issaker Gavitt and eighteen other  
white citizens steobed forrerd. also.  
Let em clasp each other by the hand  
while I wave over em the flag &quot;V our  
common ken try.&quot;  
It wnz done. The twenty twa nig­  
gers stepped forred, the whites desig­  
nated advanced, the two lines trasoed  
each other by the hand, and I wnz  
about to wave, when Joe Bigler riz.  
He begged me to wait a minit till he  
had made his remark. The site afore

he had ever harbored a susoisien that.  
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
A calm and comprehensive survey nv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv  
the Diinocricy, our hope uv success was ex­  
ceedingly thin. The resoloosbens introdoost  
by Vallandygum into the convenshua uv  
the Dimocrisy uv Montgomery county,  
Ohio, wuz to ine a new lite. Troo, they  
hev the elite disadvantage uv abjoonn  
every thing that is Ditnocratic, and  
uv puttin the Dimoeratic party on  
purely ltepublikin ground; but wat ol that?  
I kin stand even so sudden a change as that.  
YVat I want is the soopreme happiness of  
kiekin that nigger Lubbock out of the post­  
offis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in  
his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder  
Pennibackpr, who liev been languishin out­  
side the ottiises uv assessor and collector,  
are actooated by tbe same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the okke­  
pvin uv Republican ground, the war cry uv  
us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky :s shoor  
to go Dimecrutic aryliow, aud it we kin by  
so simple a process ez passin resoloosbens  
indoose enutt&#x27;dissatistied Republikins in the  
close Northern States to vote with us to  
elect a Democratic president who will give  
us these boons, we three are for passin these  
resoloosbens,no matter wat they are. ibis  
bein my uuderstandin uv Y allaudygum s  
movement, I actid onto it to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimoericy uv the Cor­  
ners together one nite at Baseom&#x27;s. That I  
mite get era all at one time, I waited till the  
regler evenin for the raid on the niggers  
and Northern settlers up toards Garcetts­  
town, kiiowin that, on ther return, they&#x27;d  
all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that,  
ef the&#x27;d bin successful in their haugin and  
buruin, they&#x27;d be iu good humor and ready  
to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz  
a very short but a very satisfactory consul­  
tasheu. There was some objeekshus on the  
partuvafewto wat they called an aban­  
donment uv Dimoeratic ideas, but Bascom  
settled their hash in very short meter. He  
remarked that it wuz necessary that the  
offise8 lie in the hands uv his friends lor  
ohvlus reasons. He wantid pay and he  
knowed uv no other way to git ic. He be­  
leeved in the fullest ifeedom uv thought  
and ackshen, and that every one shood ex­  
press hisself untrameled, but he coodent  
abide a idiot. It&#x27; there wuz any one in that  
assemblage so stoopid as to differ with him  
on this question, let him make hisself  
known. No sick man shood ever get a drop  
at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not de­  
servin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv  
life. Several who liad riz to their feet to  
object, dropt ez though thev hed been shot.  
It wuz determined to kohl a public rneetin  
the next nite at the church to make a pub­  
lic endorsement of Y&#x27;allandygum&#x27;s idea.  
Ez the priusiple objick of the meetin wuz  
to convius the Republikins uv tlie doubtful  
states that the Dimoericy of the South really  
aeceptid the situashen, and meant, iu dead  
earnest, to recognise the great priusiple uv  
equality, 1 arranged to have all the niggers  
uv the Corners present, aud saved for era  
the best seats iu the house. Joe Bigler aud  
Pollock come, uv course, which I coodent  
help.  
I opened the exercises by making a short  
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist that  
the time had finally arriv when the lion aud  
the lamb hed layed down together anil a  
small child was a leadin uv em. I knowd  
that onr colored teller-citizens hed been die­  
pitefully voosed. and that doo respeck bed  
not bin alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv  
the North, but that time hed now passed  
and I hoped forever. The Dimoericy uv  
the North, through Y&#x27;allaudyguin, bed spoke,  
they hed accepted the situashen, halleloogy,  
anil from this time henceforth anil forever  
there wuz to be nothin but peeee.  
Ur sol red. That the Dimoericy uv the  
Y&#x27;oonited States recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the cous&#x27;titoo­  
shen doorin and since the late onph-asant­  
nis, and that they recognize and most  
heartily acquiesce in all the results of the  
war; that they not only w ithdraw all their  
opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, lint  
pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin  
fellow-citizens hev not only this but all  
other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively  
by the Caucashen.  
I pnt the question ez to the adopshen uv  
the resolushen, and it wuz carried yoonani­  
mouslv. It wood av bin well lied I stopped  
here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. Mv prevaliu weakness  
is to slop over, aud I slopped on this ukka­  
sion fearfully. I called upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to prove their faith by their  
works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, iu a spasm uv  
delite, &quot;present at this meetin twenty-two  
uv our fellow citizens uv Afrikin descent.  
Let em step forrerd on this platform—let  
Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibaeker. Bas­  
com, Issacker Gavitt, aud eighteen other  
white citizens step forrerd also. Let them  
clasp each other by the hand, while I wave  
over em the flag of our common kentrv.&quot;  
It was done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forrerd, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other by  
the hand, aud I was about to wave, when  
J&lt;^&gt; Bigler riz. He begged me to wait a  
minit till he hed made Ins remark. The site  
atore him moved him almost tu teers. Ef  
he hed harbored a suspiskeu that there  
wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky  
breast, he took it all hack. The action uv  
to-uite wuz not only just but it wuz gen­  
erous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;wby generous ?&quot;  
&quot;Beeoz,&quot; sed lie, &quot;the niggers wood lie in  
a devilish bad way ef you hedn&#x27;t decided on  
givin em their rites, uv yoor own akkord,  
tor there ain&#x27;t no power&quot;no\v that kin com­  
pel yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern pa­  
per—alas! the Repnldikiu partv is split mto  
tragments—remarkably small fragments.  
Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol, last  
Monday, Logan hez been stoned by tbe Re­  
publikins ot Philadelfv on his wav Lome,  
tbe Central Committees uv Ohio. Injeany  
and IUinev, hev divided, and each fraeksheu  
liez called a Convenshen, and the Noo Y&#x27;ork  
Triboon throws up tlie sponge and sez that  
nothin under Ilevin kin prevent tbe sukeess  
uv the Diuiocritic candidate for the Presi­  
dency; no matter who he may be, or wat  
platform he is put onto. In view of tlie dis­  
solooshen uv the Repuhlikin party, and the  
fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no per  
teekters, its really generous that voo--&quot;  
&quot;The ltepublikin party is gone&quot; to pieces !

[From the Toledo Blade.]  
Coxfedrit X Roads, Y  
(which is in the State of Kentucky,) &gt;  
May 24-, 1871. _ &gt;  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv  
the politikle field satisfied me, some  
months ago, that with some shift in the  
position uv the Dimocrisv, our hope uv  
success wuz cxeeedinly thin. The reso­  
looshens interdoost by&#x27; Vallandygum into  
the Convenshun of the Dimocrisy uv Mont­  
gomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new  
ife. Troo, they her the slite disadvan­  
tage uv adjooring everythin that is Dinto­  
cratic, and uv puttin the Dimoeratic party  
on Kepublikin ground, but wat uv that? I  
kin stand even so sudden a change ez that  
Wat I want is the soopreme happiness uv  
kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the  
postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin my­  
self in his place, and Kernel MePelter and  
Elder Pennibacker who hev bin languish­  
in outside the offices uv Assessor and  
Collector are actooated by the same high  
and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires  
the okkepyin uv Kepublikin ground, the  
war cry uv us three is “okkepy.” Ken­  
tucky is shoor to go Democratic anyhow,  
and if we kin by so simple a process ez  
pass in resolooshens indoose enutf dissatis­  
fied Kepublikins in the close Northern  
States to vdte with us to elect a Democrat­  
ic President who will give us these boons,  
we three are for passin these resolooshens  
no matter wat they are. This bein my  
understandin uv Vailandygum&#x27;s movement  
I acted onto it to wunst.  
I got the leadin Dimmoerisy of the  
Cornets together one nite at liascom&#x27;s.  
That I mite get em all at one time, I wait­  
ed till the regler evenin for the raid on  
the niggers and northern settlers up to­  
wards Garrettstown, knowin that on their  
return they’d all stop at liascom&#x27;s for a  
drink, and that ef they’d bin successful in  
their hangin and burnin they’d be in good  
humor and ready to julopt anythin I shood  
suggest. It wuz a short but very satisfac­  
try consultashen. There wuz some ob­  
jickshuns on the part uv a few, to wat they  
called an abandonment uv Dimoeratic  
idees, but llaseom settled their hash in  
very short metre. Ife remarkt that it wuz  
necessary that the offises be in the hands  
uv his friends for obvius reasons. He  
wantid pay and lie kuowed uv no other  
way to git it. lie beleeved in the fullest  
freedom uv thought and ackshen, and that  
every one shood express hisself untram­  
meled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If  
there wuz any one in that assemblage so  
stupid ez to differ with him on ttiat ques­  
tion, let him make hisself known. No  
sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar,  
never; sich a one wuz notdeservin of even  
the commonest nesessaries uv life. Seve­  
ral who lied riz to their feet to object  
dropt ez though they lied bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meet­  
in the next nite at the church to make a  
public endorsement uv Yallandygum’s  
idees.  
  
J&#x27;.z me pnnsipai object uv the meetin  
wuz to convins the Kepublikius uv the  
doubtful Suites that the Pimoerasy uv the  
South really accepted the situashou, and  
nient, in tied earnest, to recognize the  
great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to  
hev all the niggers uv the Corners present  
and saved for ent the best seats in the  
house. Joe Bigler and Pollock cum uv  
eoorse, which L coodent help.  
1 opened Ihe exercises by makin a short  
speech ez I took the chair. L rejoist that  
the time had finally arriv when the lion  
and the lamb bed layed down together,  
and a small child wuz a leadin uv cm. I  
knowed that our colored fellow-citizens  
lied bin dispitefully yoosed, and that doo  
respeek hed not bin alluz paid to our fel­  
low-citizens uv the North, but that time  
hed now passed, aud 1 hoped forever.  
The Pimocrisy uv the North, through  
Yallandygum, hed spoke, they hed ac­  
cepted the situashen, halleloogv, and from  
this time henceforth and forever there  
wuz to lie nothiu but peace. 1 then offer­  
ed the following resotooshen:  
Resolved. That the Pimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States, recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the Consti­  
toosheu dooring and since the late on­  
pleasantnis, and that they recognize and  
most heartily acquiesce in all the results  
uv the war; that they not only withdraw  
all their opposhen to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our Afri­  
kin fellow-citizens hev not only tills but  
all other rites heretefore enjoyed cxeloo­  
sively by the Caucashen.  
  
1 put the question ez to the aitopshen uv  
the resoloosheu, and it wuz carried yoo­  
nauimusly. It wood liev bin well bed I  
stopped here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. My prevalin  
weekness is to slop over and I slopt on  
this okknsion uv the Corners to prove their  
faith by their works. ‘There are,’ I said,  
in a spasm of delitc, ‘present at this  
meetin twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens  
uv Afrikin descent. Let cm step forred  
on this platform—let Deckin Togram,  
Elder Pennibacker.Uascom, IssakerGavitt  
and eighteen other white citizens step for­  
red. also. Let them clasp each other by  
the hand while I wave over em the flag uv  
our common kentry.’  
It was done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I wuz about to wave,  
when Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to  
wait a rninit till lie had made his remark.  
The site afore him moved him almost to  
teers. Kf he lied ever harbored a suspish­  
eu that there wuzn’t anything generous in  
the Kentucky breast, lie took it all back.  
The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not only just,  
but it was generous.  
“Generous!” sed I, “ why generous?”  
“Becoz,” sed he, “the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way cf yoo liedn’t decided  
on givin em their rites, uv yoor own ak­  
kord, for there aiut no power now that kin  
compel yoo to do it. i jist got a northern  
paper—alas! the Kepublikin party is split  
  
into fragments—remarkably small frag­  
ments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the  
Capitol last Monday, Logan hez bin ston­  
ed by the Ilepublkins uv Philadelfy on his  
way home, the Central Committees uv  
Ohio, Injeny and lllinoy, hev divided, and  
each ftackshen hez called a convenshen,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under heven  
kin prevent the success uv the Democratic  
candidate for the Presidency, no matter  
who he may be or wat platform he is pi^t  
onto. In view uv the dissolooshen uv the  
Republikin party, and the fact that the  
niggers aint how got no perteckters, its  
really generous that voo——”  
“The Republikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it? gapped my twentjySW white  
friends in korious.” &quot;  
“It hez.” responded &#x27;  
“Then,&quot; sed Deekin Ingram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, “What we’ve  
done and sed don’t count! Take that, you  
black cuss!” t ( -*  
Ami with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin  
feclit the darkey whose hand he hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which lusted him clean off the plat­  
form. The others follered soot, and in  
their zeal sprang off the platform after eni,  
and wuz a exeeutin war dances uv the  
most frantic descripshen onto their pros­  
trate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that  
Pollock and Bigler restrained em from  
takin uv em out and hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen  
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirmiu  
our adherence to the constooshen ez it  
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­  
ments, and the nateral soopremaPy uv the  
white man over the d—d nigger, after wich  
we adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our cus­  
tom, and there organized fresh raids onto  
our natural enemies.  
The next mornin I notised a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pol­  
lock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed,  
with a broadnis I couldn’t account for.  
Lubbock, the nigger Postmaster, bust into  
a roor ez I walked into his offis, and I an­  
grily demandid the reason for his hilarity.  
“Dat mistake of Bigler’s,” returned he,  
laughin’ louder than before.  
“What mistake?” I asked, turnin pale,  
for a suspishun wuz creepin over me.  
“Why, he didn’t get no papers at all,  
and—’’  
  
“Anil all that story about that split in  
the Republiken party North wuz one uv  
his infernal lies!’’  
“Dat&#x27;s about lie correct state ob de case!”  
replied the nigger showin all his ivories,  
“liigler wanted to see ef yoor pentance  
wuz &quot;enooine—dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob  
it. lie ’sprest a desire to assertane jist  
how peeceable yood be to de nigger and  
do Northern people down heali, ef dah  
wuzn’t no Tublikin party up North to hold  
yoo; dat wuz all.”  
And the nigger luffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all!” he repeated.  
It wuz euuff. I guess the cuss found out  
all that he wanted to. Uv course this ‘out­  
rage,’ cz they call it, will get into the  
Northern papers, and uv course Vallandy­  
gum’s assershuns will explode itself with­  
out hurtiu anybody. Joe Bigler is my  
evil genius. 1 she! never be able to ruu  
things ez I want to so long ez he lives.

CoFEDRIT X Rc-iDS,  
(Wich is in tbe State nv Kentucky,)  
May 24, 1871.  
A cam and rnraorehen.ivo survey uv the  
pnlitikle field s-itifiid me, some months  
ago, that without some shift in tbe pnsisb­  
un uv the Dimncrisy, our hope uv success  
wui exceedinly thin. The reso&#x27;ooshens in­  
terdoist I y Vallandygiim into the Cnnven­  
shnn uv the Dimncrisy uv Montgomery  
County. Ohio, wuz tn me a new lite. Tron,  
they hev the slite disadvantage nv nbjonrin  
everything that.is Dimncratic nnd nv put­  
tin the Dimocratie party on purely Brpnh­  
likin ground, hut wnt ur that? I kin stand  
even so sudden a change rz that. Wnt I  
want, is the annprcme happiness ov kiekin  
that nigger Lnbhnck out nv the pest nffis at  
the Corners, nnd uv pnttin mvself in his  
place, and Kernel MePelternnd Elder Pen­  
nibacVer, who hey bin langntshin outside  
tbe offices uy Assesser nnd Coll -cter, nre  
aetnoatid by tho same high nnd holy im  
pulse. Ef tn do this requires the okkepv-  
n uv Kepuiilixin ground, tha war crv uv  
us three is &quot;okkepv.&quot; Kentucky is shonr  
tn go Dimocritic anyhow, nnd if we kin.  
hy so simple a process ez pasain resnl.io­  
aliens, indnnae ennfi&quot; d&#x27;ssatisfiej Repub i-  
kins in the close Northern States tn vote  
with us to el-ct a Dimocratia President win  
will give us these boons we theeo nre for  
pasain these resnlooshens, no matter wat  
they are. This bein my understandin uv  
Vnllandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it  
to wunst.  
I got the leedin Diraocraev uv the Cor  
ners tngether nnc nite nt Biscim&#x27;s. Th it  
I mite git em all nt one tim, I waited till  
the regler tvenin for the raid on the nig­  
gers and Northern settlers np toards G ir­  
retutown, knowin that on their return  
they&#x27;d nil stop nt B iscom&#x27;s for n drink, nnd  
that t f they&#x27;d bin succ-ssful in ther hangin  
nnd burnin, they&#x27;d he in good humor, nnd  
reddv tn ndopt anything I shood sejest.  
It wuz a very short but a very satisfactory  
consult isben. Ther wuz some objecksbuns  
on tho part uv n few to wat they called a  
abandonment uv Dimocratie ijces, but Bas­  
eom settle I ther hash in very short metre.  
II&#x27; remarkt that it wuz neas irv tb it the  
o fines be in the bands uvhii fren Is. for  
nbrius rensons. lis wantid pay, nnd he  
knnwed uv no other way to git it. n  
beleeyed in the fullest frcednum uv thought  
nnd ackshen. nnd that every one shood ex­  
press hisself untrimelcd, but be coodent  
nhide. a idiot. If ther wuz nnv nnc in that  
assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him  
on this question, let him make hisself  
known. No sich man shood ever git a drop  
at his bar, never: sich a one wuz not de­  
servin uv even the commonest nesesirics  
uv life. Sever il who bed riz to ther feet  
to object, dropt ez tho they bed bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meet­  
in the next nite, nt the church, to make a  
public endorsement uv Vnllnndygum&#x27;s ijee.  
Ez the prinsiple objek uv tbe meetin  
wuz tn convins tbe Repuhlikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrisy ur the  
South really acceptid tbe situash&#x27;en, and  
meant, in ded ernest. to recognize the  
grate prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to  
hev all the niggers uv the Corners present,  
and saved for em tbe best seats in the  
house. Joe Bigler and Pollock come, uv  
coarse, wich I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises hy m.ikin a short  
speech rz I took the cheer. I rrjoist that  
the time bed finally arriv vcben tbe lion and  
the Iamb bed laved down together, nnd a  
small child wuz a leadin uv cm. I knowd  
that our colored feller-citizens hed bindis-pit-folly  
vnnst-d, and that doo respeck bed  
not bin niluz paid to our feller-citizens uv  
the North, hut that time hed now passed,  
and I hoped forever. Tb Dimocrisy uv  
the North, throo Vallandygum, hed spoke;  
thev bed accepted tbe situaaben, hnlleloogy,  
and from this time henceforth and forever  
ther wuz to bo nothin but peece. I then  
offered the follerin rsnlnshen:  
Rtsolrti, That tbe Dimocrisy uv the  
Tnonited States recognize the legality uv  
an ton amendments madi tn ins Uonstitno­  
shen dnorin and since the late nopleasant­  
nis, and that they recognize and most birt­  
ily aequies in all the reealts nv the war;  
that they do not only withaVawnll therop-posish-n  
toy ionirersil suffrage, iut pledge  
tberseives to see tr-at nor Atniin Teller cit­  
izens hev not only this, but nil other rites  
-heretofore enjiyed excloosively by tbe Cau-  
casbea.  
f f t tbe question ez tn tba ndnpshen ur  
the resojoash&#x27;a, and it wax carried voonan­  
imusly. It rn hev bin well lied I stop­  
ped here, but 1 did. My prevalin weak­  
ness is tn slop over, and 1 slopt ta this ok­  
kabnn frwrfully. I called vnym the citi  
zens uv the Corners to prove ther faith hy  
ther worts. ther are,&quot; i sea in , spasm  
OT delite, &#x27;&#x27;present at this meetin twenty  
two uv our feller ciliiens uv Afrikin de-  
s:ent.  
Let em step forrerd on this platform  
1 let Deekin Ppgrarn, Elder Prnnibacker,  
Bascom, Issaker Garitt, and eigbteerj other  
  
white citizens, step forreid, alsj. Let em  
  
clasp each other by the band, wbrle I ware  
over em the Hag uy our common Keniry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped fnrrerd, tbe whites designated ad­  
vanced, tbe two lir.es grasped each other by  
theMnnd, and I wuz about tojrave, when  
Joe Bigler riz. He begged&#x27;inevi&#x27;o wait a  
minit, till he bed made bis remark, ibe  
site nfore bim moved bim almost to teers.  
Ef be bed ever harbored a srjspisben that  
ther wuzn&#x27;t anvtbing generous in the Ken  
tucky brest, he took it all back. Tbe ack­  
shen ur to-nito wuz not only just, but it  
wuz generous.  
&#x27;Generous!&quot; sed I; &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&#x27;Bcnz,&quot; sed be, the niggers wood be in  
n devilish bad way ef yoo bedn&#x27;t decided  
on givin em ther rites, uryoor own nkkord,  
for ther ain&#x27;t no power now that kin com­  
p &#x27;1 yoo to do it. I jist got a northern pa­  
per nlxs! the Republikin party is split in­  
to fragments remarkably small fragments.  
Grant assaulted Sumner in tbe I&#x27;npitol, lost  
Monday; Logan hez bin stoned by tho Re­  
publikins uv Filadelfy, on his way home;  
the Central Committees ur Ohio, Injeany  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each fncshen  
hez called a convensben; and the Noo York  
TvJlii-i rttn t .nm nr tlid. aviAMaja tas-irl IB  
.1, assets IU1 enr- UU s4VT CUUUb HUU OS-aw  
that notbin under bevin kin prevent tbe suc­  
cess uv the Dimocratio candidate for the  
Presidency, no matter nho he may be, or  
wat platform be is put onto. In view uv  
tbe disoloosben uv the Republikin party,  
and tbe fact that tho niggers ain&#x27;t now got  
no pertrcktcrs, its really generous that  
yoo &quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone tl pieces!  
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white f rends,  
in knrious.  
&quot;It hez!&quot; respnndid Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Dcekin Pogram. bis eyes  
fiashin with unwontid fire, &quot;wat we&#x27;vi done  
AND SED DO&#x27;T COCSt! TaKK THAT, TOO  
black crss!&quot;  
And with a strength nnd activity wich 1  
hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, tbe Derkin  
fecht the darkey, whose band be hed bin  
grnspin, a most powerful blow atween the  
eves, wich bisted him clean off the platform.  
The others fullered soot, and in ther xenl  
sprang off tbe platform after em, and wuz  
n cxreutin wnr-dances uv the most frantio  
deserip&#x27;hen onto ther prostrate bodies. It  
wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler  
restrained em from takin uv em out and  
hangin nv em.  
Ez a matter uv coarse, the resolnoben  
wuz rescinded, nnd others adopted, nffirmin  
our adherence to the constooshen ez it yoost  
to be, the illegality uv tbe amendments, and  
the nateral e)onVemey ov ihr whitnn  
over the d d nigger, &quot;after which we ad  
journed tn Bascom&#x27;s, ez iz our custom, and  
ther organized fre.b raids onto.our nateral  
enemies.  
The next mornin I nntise.1 a pecoolyer  
took on Bigler&#x27;s fice, nnd likewise nn Pol­  
lock&#x27;s. They grinned nt me ez I passed,  
with a hroidnis wich I cnodn&#x27;t account for.  
Luhlmck, tho nigger Postmaster, bust into  
n mar ez I walked into bis nffis, nnd I angri­  
ly demandid the reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dn mi&#x27;take oh Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned he,  
Iiughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; 1 asked, turnininpale,  
for a Huspiahun wuz crreepin over roe.  
&quot;Why, ho didn&#x27;t git no paper nt all,  
and &quot;  
&quot;And all that sory about tha split in th  
Republikin party North wuz one uv his in­  
ferml lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dit&#x27;s about dc correct state nbde case!&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin nil his ivories.  
&quot;Bigler wanted to see ef yoor pentanc  
wuz genonine dat&#x27;s about all dih wuz nh  
it. Ho &#x27;sprest n desire to assertano jist  
how peaceable yood b to de nigger nnd de  
Northern peopldown heah, ef dih wuzn&#x27;t  
no &#x27;I&#x27;utilikin party up North to hold yoo;  
dit wuz all.&quot;  
And the nigger laded a feendish laff.  
&quot;Oat wuz ill!&quot; be repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out  
all that be wanted to. Uv coirsa this &quot;out-  
vge.&quot; ez they will call it, will git into the  
Northern papers, and uv coarse Vnllandy­  
gum&#x27;s assershun will explode itself without  
hurtin anybody. Joe. Bieler is my evil  
genius. I shel&#x27;never be nbla to ran things  
ez I want to, so long ez he lives.

made his remark. The site afore

he had harbored a thought that thur

The action nv to nite wuc not only

&quot;what wo&#x27;ve dono and sed don

that our colored fellow-citizens hed bin  
desnitcfully yooaed, trad that duo respect  
had not bin ltnz paid to our fellow-citizens  
uv the North, but that time hed now pass­  
ed, and I hoped forever. The Domoorisy  
uv the North, through Vallandyum, hed  
spoke, they hed accepted the situoshen,  
hallcloogy, ttndlrom this time henceforth  
aud forever there vuz nothin but peeco. I  
tlicn offered the following resoloosb.cn :  
&quot;Itesolvcd, That tho IMinocrisy uv the  
Yoonitcd States rccognizo the legality uv  
all tho amendments made to theConstitoo­  
slicn dooring and since the late onpleasant­  
nis, and that they recognize and most hear­  
tily acquicsco in all tho romilta uv the war;  
that they not only withdraw all their oppo­  
sition to yoouivcrsal suffrage, but pledgo  
thcirselvcs to see that our Afrikin follow  
citizens hev not only this but all other rites  
heretofore enjoyed escloosivcly by the Cau­  
cashcu.&quot;I put tho question cz to tho adosphen uv  
tho resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoon­  
nnimously. It wood hev bin well lied I  
Btoppcd here, but I didn&#x27;t. My provalin  
weekness is to slop over and I slopt on this  
okkasion fearfully. I called upon tho citi­  
zens uv tho Corners to prove their faith by  
their works. &quot;Thero are,&quot; I said In a spasm  
of dclito, &quot;present at this mcctin twenty­  
two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin de­  
scent. Let em step forrcrd on this plat­  
form let Dcckin Pograni, Elder Pcnni­  
backcr. Bascom, Issaker Gavitt and eigh­  
teen other white citizens step forrerd, also.  
Let them clasp each other by tho hand  
while I wave over em tho flag uv our com­  
mon kontry.&#x27;  
It wuz done. Tho twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, tho whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by tho hand, and J, was about to wave,  
when Joe. lJigler riz. Ho begged mo to  
wait a minit tul ho had made his remark.  
Tho silo beforo him almost moved him to  
ters. Ef ho hod ever harbored a suspishcu  
that there wuzn&#x27;t any tiling generous in tho  
Kentucky breast ho took it all back, l&#x27;ho  
ncksliun uv to-nite wuz not OBly just tmt  
it was generous.  
&quot;licucrous 1&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous ?&quot;  
&quot;llccoz,&quot; sed ho, &quot;tho niters wood be  
in a dcvlish bad way ef yw nedn&#x27;t decided  
on given cm their rites, uv yoor own ak­  
koru, for there ain&#x27;t no power now tuat kin  
compel voo&#x27;to do it. I .list cot a northern  
  
paper alas I tho Ilcpubliklu party is split  
iuw iiuiueuia ruiutuauuiy buiiui irug-  
nicnts. Uraut assaulted Sumner In tho  
Capital last Monday, Logan hes bin stoned  
by tho Itcpublikins uv l&#x27;hiladelfy on his  
way home, tho Central Committees uy  
Ohio, Injeany and lllinoy hev divided, and  
each frackshen hes called a convensliun,  
and tho Noo York IViboon throws un the  
Bpongo andscz that nothin under hcviukiu  
movent tuc success uv tho Democratic can  
ilidatc for tho Presidency, no matter who  
ho may be or wat platiorm ho is put onto.  
In view of the dissolooshen uv the Kc-  
publikin party, and tho fact that tho nig­  
gers ain&#x27;t now got no pcrtcctors, its really  
generous that yoo &quot;  
&quot;Tho licpublikin party is gono to pieces  
&#x27;hcz it,&quot; gasped my twenty-two whito  
friends in korious.  
&quot;It hcz.&quot; resnonded TJialpr.  
&quot;Then,&quot; saiil Dcekin Pogram, Lis eyes  
flashin with unwontid Arc, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count I Tako that you  
black cuss.&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich  
I hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one to agid, the Dee­  
Liu fecht tho darkey whos baud ho hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow atween tho  
eyes, which lusted him clean oil tho plat  
form. Tho others follercd suit, and in their  
zeal sprang off tho platform after cm, and  
waz a executin war dances uy tho most  
frantic derjcripshen unto their prostrate  
bodies. It wuz withdifliculty that Pollock  
and Biglcr restrained em from takin uv em  
out and hanging uv em.  
Ez matter uv course the resolooshen wuz  
reciuded, and others adopted allirmin our  
adhcrenco to the constitushun ez it yoost  
to bo, the illegality uv tho amendments, and  
tne natural soopremacy uv the whito man  
over 1110 u a nigger, alter winch wo  
adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom,  
aud there organized fresh raids onto our  
nateral enemies.  
Tho next mornin.&#x27; I notised a pccoolyer  
look on Bigler&#x27;s &amp;.&amp;, likewise on Pollock&#x27;s.  
They grinned at rhc as I passed, with a  
vruiuima inac x coiuun&#x27;i account lor. Lub­  
bock, tho nigger postmaster, bust into a  
roor ez I walked into his oflis, and I an­  
grily demanded tho reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistako ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returricd he,  
laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake ? I asked, turnin palo,  
for a suspishen wuz crecpin over me.  
&quot;Why, hedidn&#x27;tgetnopaperat all, and&quot;  
&quot;And all thftl Estorv about tho sulit in tho  
Kcpublikiu party North wuz ouo uv his in  
ternal lies 1&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about do correct state ob de caso!&quot;  
replied tho nigger, showiu all his ivories.  
&quot;Biglcr wanted to see of yoor pentance  
wuz irenooiue dat&#x27;s about all dali wuz ob  
it. Ho &#x27;sorest a desire to assertano jist  
how peccable yood bo to do nigger aud do  
Northern people down hcah, ef dali wuzn&#x27;t  
no &#x27;I&#x27;ublikm party up North to hold yoo  
rial wins all.&quot;  
Aud tho nigger laded a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all 1&quot; ho repeated.  
It wuz cnulf. I guess the euss found out  
an that no wanted to. Uv course this  
&quot;outrage,&quot; as they will call it, will get into

yoonanlmously. It wood hev bin well

Xasby on the Mew Departure.  
[From the Toledo Blade ]  
Confedrit X Roads,  
(wieh iz in the State of Kentucky.)  
May 24, 1871.  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv the  
Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedinly  
thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Yallandyghatn  
into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisy  
uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a  
new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage  
uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and  
uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin  
ground, but wat uv that ? I kin stand  
! even so sudden a change ez that! Wat 1 want  
iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger  
Lubbock out uv the postofiis at the Corners,  
and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel  
McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bio  
languishiu outside the offices uv assessor and  
collector are actooatid by the same high and  
holy impulses. Ef to Jo this requires the  
okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry  
uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so  
simple a process ez nassin resolooshens iudoose  
enuff dissatisfied Uepublikins in the close  
Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic  
President who will give us these boons,  
we three are for passin these resolooshens no  
matter what they are. This bein my uuderstandin  
uv \ allandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid  
onto it to wunst.  
1 fi-ot the leedin D mncriav uv fKo I V.rrw?ru  
  
together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That 1 mite  
get em all at ooe time, I waited till the regler  
evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern  
settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that  
on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for  
a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in  
their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good  
humor and ready to adopt anything I shood  
suggest. It vruz a very short but a very satisfactry  
oonsultashen. There wuz some objiekshuns  
on the part uv a few to wat tbey called  
an abandonment uv Dimoeratic idees, but Bas  
com settled their hash in very short metre.  
He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the  
offises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius  
reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv  
no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the  
fullest freedom uv thought and ackshen, and  
that every one shood express hisself untrarameled,  
but he coodent abide a idiot. If there  
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez  
to differ with him on that question, let him  
make hisself known. No sick man shood ever  
git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz  
not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries  
uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to  
  
object dropt ez though they hed bio shot.  
It wuz determined to bold a public meetin  
the next nite at the church to make a public  
endorsement uv Yallandygum&#x27;s idees.  
Ez the prinsipal objict uv the meetin wuz to  
convins the Republikios uv the doubtful States  
that the Diinocrisy uv the South really accepted  
the situashun, and meat, in ded ernest, to recognise  
the great priosiple uv equality, I arranged  
to hev all the niggers u v the Corners present,  
and saved for thcra the best seats in the house.  
Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I  
ooodont help.  
I opened the exercises by making a short  
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the  
time hed finally arriv when the lion and the  
lamb hed laid down together, and a small child  
wuz leading uv em. 1 knowed thet our colored  
fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yooaed,  
and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid  
to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that  
time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The  
Dimucrisy uv the North, Vrallandygum, hed  
spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy,  
and from this time henceforth and forever  
there wuz to be notbin but peece. i then  
offered the follerm resoloosheu :  
&quot;Resolved, That the Diinocrisy uv the Yoouited  
States recognize the legality uv all the  
amendments made to the Constituoshen dooring  
and since the late onpleaBantnis, and that they  
recognise aud most heartily acquiesce in all the  
results uv the war ; that they not ouly withdraw  
all their opposisben to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our  
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but  
all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively  
by the Caucashen.&quot;  
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the  
reaolooshen, aud it wuz carried yoonanimusly.  
It wood hev bin well hed I stopped here, but I  
didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekuess is to slop over,  
and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called  
upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their  
faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; 1 said, in  
a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this meetin  
twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin  
descent. Let em step forrerd on this platform  
P lmj?i&gt; :i?i? u -  
  
?ici i/ccaiu a g^raui, liiun i cuuiuftuher, i&gt;iis  
com, Issaker Guvitt, and eighteen other white  
citizens step forrerd also. Let them clasp  
each other by the hand while 1 wave over em  
the flag uv our common kontry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two uiggers stepped  
forrerd, the whites designated advanced,  
the two lines grasped each other by the hand,  
and I wuz about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize.  
Ho begged me to wait a minnit till he hed made  
hia remark. The site afore him moved him almost  
to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen  
that there wuzu&#x27;t anything generous in  
the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The  
acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz  
generons.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a  
devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given  
them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for there  
ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do  
it I jist got a Northern paper?alas! the Kepublikin  
party is split into fragments?remarkably  
small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner  
in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by  
the Kepublikins uv Philadelfy on hiz way  
home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany,  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz  
called a convenshen, and the Noo York  
Triboon throws up the sponge and sez that  
notbin under the hevin Wo prevent the success  
uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency,  
no matter who he may be or wat platform be is  
put onto. In view uv the dissoloosben uv the  
Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers  
ain&#x27;t now got no perteckters, its really generous  
that yoo &quot;  
&quot; The Kepublikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends  
in korions.  
&quot; It hez 1&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot; Then,&quot; said Deo kin Pogr&amp;ui, his eyes flashin  
with unwonted fire, &quot; what we&#x27;ve dene and  
and don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss ?&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deck in  
fecht the darkey whose hand he bed bin graspin,  
a most powerful blow atweea the eyes which  
histed him clean off the plutform, the others  
followered soot, and in their zeal sprang off the  
  
platform after em, aad wax a executia war  
dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto  
their proatrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty  
that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from  
takin uv em out and hanging uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the reaalooshen wuz  
reminded, and others adopted affirmin our ad&#x27;  
bereoce to the constitoosbatf ez it yoost to bo,  
the illegality uv the amendments, and the  
natural soopremacy uv the white man over the  
1 d?4 nigger, after wich we adjourned to Basoom&#x27;s,  
ex is our custom, and there organized  
frfih raids onto our nateral enemies  
The next morning 1 notised a pecoolyer look  
&#x27; oa Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s,  
frinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis  
wich I oauldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the  
1 postmaster, bust into a roar ez 1 walked  
4nto bis offis, and I angrily demanded the rea­  
son for has hilarity.  
*&#x27; LhSl mistake ob Biglers,&#x27;* returned be,  
laughHbg loader than before.  
&quot; What mistake?&quot; 1 asked, turning pale, fo:  
a suspishen was creepin over me.  
44 Whv, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and?&#x27;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the  
Republikiu party North wuz one uv his infer  
nalliee!&quot;  
44 Bat&#x27;s about de oorreet state ob de cess 1&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin all his ivories.  
M Bigler wanted to see ef yoor &#x27;pentance wui

*sprest a desire to assertane jist how peeceabU

Let em Etep forrcrd on this platform let leekin

wuz about to wave, wben Joe Bigler riz He  
begged me to wait a minit till he bad made his

tu teers. Efhebed ever harbored a puspishen  
that there wazn&#x27;t anything generou in the  
Kentucky breast he took it all back. The ack­  
fben uv to-night wuz not only just, but it wuz  
generous.  
Generous &quot;&#x27;sedl, &quot; why generous &#x27;  
14 Iteeoc,&quot; sed he, &quot; the niegers wod be m a  
deTibh bad way ef you helnt decided nu givin  
em their ntes, ut yoor own akkord, for there  
ain&#x27;t no power now that caxi compel yoo to do it.  
1 just got t Northern paper alas &#x27; the K?pub­  
likin party is split into fragments remarkably  
small fragments. Grant totalled Suiuner in  
the Capitol, last Monday. Logan ber beesi atoned  
by the Republikins of PhiUJelfy on his way  
home, the central committees av Ohio, Injeaoy  
and Illinoy her divided, and each frackshen hex  
called a conventhen, and the New lorkTribouc  
throws tip the sponge and sez that nothing ander  
herin kin prevent the success av the Democratic  
candidate tor the Presidency, no matter who be  
may be or wat platform be is pat onto. In view  
uv the disfcolooeben av the Kepubhkio part,  
and the tact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now go; no  
perteckters, its really generous that yoo &#x27;  
The Kepublikin party is gone to piece faei  
it?&quot; gapped my twenty-two white friends in  
koriouA.  
Ithcz&#x27;&quot; responded Bigler.  
&#x27; Then,&quot; sed leekin Poram, hi? eyes flaehin  
with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;re done and sed  
don&#x27;t count &#x27; Take that, yoo bl&amp;ck cups &#x27;&quot;  
And, with the strength and actmry wich I  
hadn&#x27;t lookt for in oae so agid, the deck in fecbt  
the darkey, whose hand be bed bin eraspin, a  
most powerful blow at ween tbe eyes wich histel  
him clean off the platform The others fullered  
Boot, and in their zeal sprang off tbe platform  
after cm, and wuz a exectttin war dance of the  
most frantic descripbhun onto their prostrate  
belies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and  
Bigler restrained em from taxin uv em oat and  
hisgtn ut em.  
Ez a matter ut coarse the resolasion wuz re­  
scinded, and others adopted affirm in our adhe­  
rence to the cocptoetben ez it yoost to be, the  
illegality uv tbe amendments, and the nitera:  
p.opremicy av the white man over thed d nig­  
ger, after wich we adjourned to lUconTs, ez is  
our custom, and there organised fresh raid onto  
oar n atert I enemies.  
The next mornin I itotised a pecoolyer look on ;  
Bigler&#x27;c face, and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s. They  
grinned at me cx X passed, with a broadnis wich  
1 couldn&#x27;t aooount for. Lubbock, the nigzer j  
postmaster, bast into a roar ez I walkt into his I  
ofiii, and I angrily demanded the reason for his 1  
hilarity.  
lUt mistake ob Bigler&#x27;e,&#x27; returned he, !  
laughing louder than before.

CONFEDERIT X ROADS, May 24th, 1871.  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv tbe  
poltiele fa-Id, satisfied w. some months ago,  
that without some sbift in tbe position uv tbe  
Dimocriry, our hope of success was exceed  
ingly tbin. Tbe resoloosbnns inturdoost by  
Vallandygum into tbe Convcnsuun ur me  
Ditnocrisy of Montgomery county, OIiS, was  
to mo a near life. Tmo, tliey ber tbe slite  
disadvantage uv abjuorin everything that iz --Dimocratic,  
and uv pittlin tbe Diuiocratic i  
parly on purely Kepublikiu ground, but wat ;  
uvtbat? I kin stand even so suddeu chances ,  
er that. Wat I want iz the sooprcnie happi­  
ness uv kiekin that nigger Lubbock out nv  
tbe postolBs at tbe Corners, and uv puttin my- -  
self in bis place, and Kerne! McPelter and  
Elder Penny backer, who have been languish- . ,  
in outside tbe offisesuv Assessor and Collector-nre  
ectooatld by tbe same high and holy im­  
pulses. Ef to do this requires tbe okkypyinjf &#x27;

that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at D.iscora&#x27;s ;&#x27;

ConfedritX Roads, (which is the state  
of Kentucky,) May 31, 1871. A calm  
and comprehensive survey uv the politi­  
kle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position  
uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success  
was exceedingly thin. The resolooshens  
introdoost by Vallandygum into the con­  
venshun, Ohio, wuz to me a new lite.  
Troo, they hev the elite disadvantage uv  
abjoorin evrything that is Dimocratic,  
and uv puttin the Dimocratic party .on  
purely Republikin ground, but wat uv  
that? I kin stand even so sudden a  
change ez that. Wat I want is the soo­  
preme happiness uv kickin that nigger  
Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Cor­  
ners, and uv puttin myself in his place,  
and Kernel MePelter and Elder Pen  
nibacker who hev bin languishin out­  
side the office uv assessor and collector  
are actooated by the same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the ok-  
kepyin uv Republican grounds, the war  
cry uv us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky  
is shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and  
if we kin by so simple a process ez passin  
resolooshens indoose enufl dissatisfied Re-  
publikins in the close Northern states to  
vote with us to elect a Democratic pres­  
iueut who will give ns these boons, we  
three are for passin these resolooshens  
no matter wat they are. This being my  
understands uv Vallandygum&#x27;s move­  
ment, I actid onto to it at wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Cor  
ners together one nite atBascom&#x27;s. That  
I might get em all at one time, I waited  
till the regler evenin for the raid on the  
niggers aud Northern settlers up toards  
Garrettstowo, knowing that on their re  
turn they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a  
drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful  
in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in  
good humor and ready to adopt anything

they called an abandonment uv Dimo­  
cratic idees, but Bascom settled their  
hash in very short metre. He remarked  
that it wuz necessary that the offises be  
in the hands uv his trends for obvius rea  
sons. He wantid pay and knowed uv  
no other way to git it. He beloeved in  
the fullest freedom uv thought and ack-  
shen, and that every one shood express  
hisself untrameled, but he coodent abide  
a idiot. If there wuz any one in that  
assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with  
him on this question, let him make his  
self known. No sich man shood ever git  
a drop at his bar, never ; sich a one wuz  
not deservin uv even the commonest nes-  
esaries uv life. Several who had riz to  
their feet to object, dropt ez though they  
hed been shot.  
It was determined to hold a public  
meeting the next nite at the church to  
hold make a public indorsement uv Val­  
landygum&#x27;s idea.  
Ez the principle object of the meetin  
wuz to convins the Republikins uv the  
doubtful states that the Dimocrisy uv  
the South really acceptid the situashen,  
and ment, in dead earnest, to recognise  
the great prinsiple uv equality, I arrang­  
ed to hev all the niggers uv the Corners  
present, and saved for em the best seats  
in the house. Joe Bigler and Pollock  
come, uv course, which I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by making a  
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-  
joist that the time hed finally arriv when  
the lion and the Iamb bed layed down  
together and a small child wuz a leadin  
uv em. I knowd that our coloredfellow-citizens  
hed bin dispitefully yoosed,  
and that doo res peck hed net bin alluz  
paid to onr fellow-citizens uv the North,  
but that time hed now passed and I hop  
ed forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North,  
though Vallandygum, hed spoke, they  
bed acceptid the situashen, halleloogy,  
  
and from this time henceforth and forev­  
er there wuz to be nothin but peeoe. I  
then offered the follerin resolooshea :  
HnmlvrH, That the Dimocrwy uv the  
Yoouited States recognizo the legality  
uv all the amendments made the const!­  
tooehon doorin and since the late onpleas­  
antnis, aud that they recognize and most  
heartily acquiesce in all the results of  
the war ; that they not only withdraw all  
their opposishen to yooniyersal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our  
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this  
but all other rites heretofore enjoyed ex­  
cloosively by the Caucashen.  
It put the question ez to theadopshen  
uv the resolooshen, and it was carried  
yoonnanimously. It wood hev bin well  
hed I stopped here, but I didn&#x27;t. My  
prevailin weakness is to slop over and I  
sloptonthis okkashun TearluIIy, I cal­  
led upon the citizens uv the Corners, to  
prove their works. &quot;There ate,&quot; I sed,  
in a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this  
meetin twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens  
uv Afrikin descent. Let era step forrerd  
on this platform let Deekin Pograra,  
Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Issker Ga­  
vitt and eighteen others white citizens  
step forrerd, also. Let them clasp each  
other by the hand while I wave over em  
the flag uv our common kentry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forrered, the whites designated  
advanced, the two lines grasped each  
other by the hand, and I wuz about to  
wave, when Joe Bigler riz. He begged  
me to wait a minit till he had made his  
remark. The site afore him moved him  
almost tu teers. Ef he hed ever harbor­  
ed a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t any­  
thing generous in the Kentucky breast  
he took it all back. The ackshen uv to­  
night wuz not only just, but it wuz gen­  
erous.&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous ?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, &quot;the niggers wood &quot;be  
in a devilish bad way ef you hedn&#x27;t de  
cided on givin em their rites, uv yoor  
own akkord, for there ain&#x27;t nopower new  
that can compel yoo to do it. I just  
got a Northern paper alas ! the Repub­  
lisiu party is split into fragments re­  
markably small fragments. Grant as­  
saulted Sumner in the Capitol, last Mon­  
day, Logan hez been stoned by the Re­  
publikins of Philadelfy on his way home,  
the ceutral committees uv Ohio, Injeany  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each frack­  
uhen hez called a convenshen, and the  
New York Triboon throws up the sponge  
and sez that nothing under heven kin  
prevent the success uv the Democratic  
candidate for the Presidency, no matter  
who be may be or wat platform he is  
put onto. In yiew uv the dissolooshen  
uv the Republikin party, and the fact  
that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no per­  
teckters, its really generous that yoo &quot;  
The Republikin party is gone to piec­  
es ! hez it ?&quot; graBxed my twenty -two  
white friends in korious.  
&quot;It hez I&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, yoo  
black cuss !&quot; . . ;  
And, with the strength and activity  
wich I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid,  
the deekin fecht the damey, whose hand  
he hed bin graspin, a most powerful  
blow atween the eyes wich histed him  
clean off the platform. The others fol­  
lowed soot, and in their zeal sprang off  
the platform after em, and wuz a execu­  
tin war dances of the most frantic des­  
cripihun onto thoir prostrate bodies. It  
wuz with difficulty that Pollock and  
Bigler restrained em from takin uv em  
out and hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resolusion  
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirm­  
in our adherence to the constooshen ez it  
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­  
ments, and the nateral soopremacy uv  
the white man over the d d nigger, aft­  
er wich we adjou-ned to Bascom&#x27;s, ex is  
our custom, and there organised fresh  
raids onto our nateral enemies. &#x27;  
The next mornin I notised a pecool­  
yer look on Bigler&#x27;s face, and likewise  
on Pollock&#x27;s. .They grinned at me ez I  
passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t  
account for. Lubbock, the nigger p ost­  
m aster, bust into a roar ez I walkt into  
his oflis, and I angrily demanded the  
reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake of ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned  
he, laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake,&quot; I asked, turning  
pale, for a suspicion wuz creepin. over  
me.  
&quot;Why he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all,  
and&#x27;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in  
the republikin party North wuz one uv  
his infernal lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de  
case !&quot; replied the nigger, showing all  
his iveries. &quot;Bigler wanted to see if  
yourpretauce wuzgenooine dat&#x27;sabout  
all dah wuz ob it. He&#x27; sprest a desire  
to aseertane jist how peeceable yood be  
to de nigger and de Northern people  
down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no&#x27; Publican  
party up North to hold yoo ; dat wus  
all.&quot;  
And the niggers laffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all !&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found  
out all he wanted to. Uv course this  
&quot;outrage,&quot; as they will call it, will get  
into the Northern papers, and course  
Vallandygum&#x27;s asserchun will explode  
itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Big.

the okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the  
war cry uv us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Ken­  
tucky is shoor to go Democrilic anyhow,  
aud if we kin by so simple a process ez  
passin resolooehens iudoose enufi dissat­  
isfied Republikins in the close Northern  
States to vote with us to elect a Demo­  
cratic President who will give us these  
boous, we three are for passing these  
resolooshens, no matter what tbey are.  
This bein my understands uv Vallan­  
dygum&#x27;s movement, I acted onto it to J  
  
wunst.  
I got the leedin Diuocracy uv the  
Corners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s.  
That I mite get em all at one time, I  
waited till the regler eveuing for the raid  
on the niggers and Northern settlers up  
towards Garrelstown, knowin that, on  
I their return, they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s  
for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin suc-  
cessful in their hangin and burniu they&#x27;d  
be in good humor, and ready to adopt  
anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very  
short but salUfactry coLsultasheu. There  
wuz some objickshums on the part of a  
few to what they called an abandonment  
uv Diuiocratic ideas, but Bascom settled  
their hash in very short metre. He re­  
mark that it wuz necessary that the of­  
fice be in the hands uv his friends lor ob­  
vious reasons. He wanted pay and he  
knowed uv no other way to git it. He  
beleeved in the fullest freedom uv thought  
and ackshen, and that every one should  
  
express himself untrampled, but helyoost to be, the iltegility uv the athendJ  
  
coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any  
one iu that assemblage so stoopid ez to  
differ with him on that question, let him  
make himself known. No sicb man  
shood ever git a drop at his bar, never ;  
such a one wuz not deservin uv even the  
commonest necessaries uv life. Several  
who bad riz to their feet to object dropt  
as. though they had been shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public  
meetin tbe next nite at the church to  
make a public endorsement of Vallandy­  
gnra&#x27;s idees.  
Es the prinsipal objict uv the meetin  
waz to convins the Republikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Democracy uv  
the South really accepted the situashen,  
and ment, in ded earnest to recognize  
tbe great prinsipal uv equality, I arranged  
to hev all the niggers uv the CoruerB  
present and saved lor em tbe best seats  
in the hou.&#x27;e. Joe Bigler and Pollock  
cum uv course, which I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by makin a  
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-  
joist that the time hed fiually arrived  
when the lion and lamb bed layed down  
together, aud a child wuz the lead in uv  
I knowed our colored fellow-citi- j  
em  
zeus hed bin despiteful! y voosed. and  
and that due respect had not bin aliuz  
paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North,,  
but that time bed now passed, and  
hoped forever. The Democrlsy uv the  
North, through Vallandygum, hed spbk,  
they bed accepted tbe situashen, balle­  
loogy, and from this time henceforth and  
forever there wuz nothin but peece t  
d-.-j .-j rri... .i... r: :J .v.  
Yoonited Stales recognize the legality j  
nv all the amendments made to the Con- i  
stitooshen dooring and sinee the late on­  
pleasantuis, and that they recognize and  
most heartily acquiesce iu all the results  
nv the war ; that they not only with  
draw all thetr opposishen to yoouiversal  
suffrage, hut pledge theirselves to see  
that our Afrikio fellow-citizens hev notj  
only this but all other rites heretofore  
enjoyed excloosively by the Caacashen.&quot;  
I put the question ez to the adopshen  
dv the resolooshens, it wnz carried yoo­  
nanimously. It would hew bid well hed  
I stopped here, - but I didn&#x27;t. My , pre-  
valin weekness is to slop over and I  
slopt on this okkasion fearfully.&#x27; I call­  
ed upon the citizens uv&quot; the Corners . to  
prove their faith by their works. &quot;There  
are, I saio in a spasm of delite, . &quot;pres­  
ent at this meetlo, twenty-two&#x27; uv ourfellow-citizens&#x27;

kontry.&quot; -

It wuz done. The twenty-two nig­  
gers stepped forred, the whites designa­  
ted advanced, and two liiee graspacT each&#x27;  
other by the hand, and 1. was about to  
wave, when Joe BigleT riz.. He begged!  
me to wait a mfnit till he bal made his

And with a strength and activity with

Confedrit X Roads (which is iu the Stait  
of Keutnck,) May 24, 1871.—A calm and  
comprehensive survey uv the politiklo field  
satisfied me, some months ago, that with­  
out some shift in the position uv the Dim  
ocrisy our hope of success wuz exceedingly  
thin. The resoloosheus introdoost by Val­  
landygum into the Convcnshun uv the  
Dimocrisy uv Montgomery county, Ohio,  
wuz to he a new life. Troo, they have the  
slite disadvantage uv abjooriug everything  
that is Dimocratic, and uv putting the  
Diraocratic party on purely Repuhlikan  
ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand  
even so sudden a change ez that. What I  
want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin  
that nigger Lubbock out uv the post offiis  
at tho Corners and uv putlin myself in his  
place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pen­  
uipaker, who hev been languishin outside  
uv tho offis ov Assessor aud Collector are  
actooated by the same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the okko­  
pyin uv Bepublikiu ground, the war cry uv  
us three iz “okkepy.” Kentucky is shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and ef wo kin  
by so simple a process ez passin resoloo­  
shuns indooso enuff dissatisfied Republi­  
kins in the close Northern States to rote  
with us to elect a Dimocratic President,  
who will give us these boons, wo three are  
for passin these resoloosheus, no matter  
what they arc. This being my understandin  
uv Vallandygum’s movement, I acted onto  
it to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Cor­  
ners together one night at Bascom’s. That  
I might get em all at one time, I waited  
till the roglcr evening for the raid on the  
niggers and Northern settlers up towards  
Garrettstown, knowin that on their return,  
they’d all stop at Bascora&#x27;s for a drink,  
and that if they&#x27;d been successful in their  
hangin and burnin they’d he in a good  
humor, and ready to adopt anything I  
should sugge st. It wuz a very short but a  
very satisfaciry consultashcn. There wuz  
some objeckshuns on the part uv a few to  
what they called an abandonment uv Dim­  
ocratic idocs, hut Bascom settled their bash  
in very short metre. He remarkt that it  
wuz necessary that tho offisis bo in the  
hands uv hi - friends for obvious reezons.  
He wanted ,&gt; iy, and he know&#x27;d of no other  
way to git it. He belseved in the fullest  
freedom uv thought and ackshen, and that  
every one should express himself uutram­  
eled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If thdre  
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid  
as to differ with him on that question, let  
him make himself known. No sich man  
shood ever git a drop at his bar, never ;  
such a one wuz not deservin uv even the  
common necessaries of life. Several who  
had risen to their teet to object, dropt as  
though they had been shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meetin  
the next night at the Church to make a  
public endorsement of Vallaudygum’s idees  
Ez the prinsipal object uv tho meetin  
wuz to convins the Rcpuhlikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the  
South really accepted the situashen, and  
meat in ded earnest to recognize tho great  
prinsipal of equality, I arranged to hev all  
the niggers uv the Corners present and  
save for em the best seats in tho house.—  
Joe Bigler ami Pollock cum uv course,  
which I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by makin a short  
speech cz I took the chair. I rejoist that  
the time hed finally arrived when the lion  
and tho lamb hed layed down together, and  
a child wuz a leedin uv them. I knowd  
that our colored fellow-citizens lied been  
Jispitefully yoosed, and that due respect  
had not been alluz paid to our fellow-citi­  
zens uv the North, hut that time had now  
passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimoc­  
risy uv the North through Vallandygum  
hed spoke; they hed accepted the situa­  
shen; halleloogy, and from this time hence­  
forth and forever there wuz nothin hut pecce  
I then offered the following resolooshen :  
llenolred, That tho Dimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality of all  
the amendments to the constitooshen door­  
ing and since the late onpleasantniss, and  
that they recognize and most heartily  
acquiesce in all the results uv the war;  
that they not only withdraw all their oppo­  
sition to yooniversal snfferage, hut pledge  
theirsclves to see that our African fellow­  
citizeus hev not only this hut all the rites  
heretofore enjoyed exclusively by the Cau­  
cashen.  
1 put tho question as to the adoption of  
the resolooshcn, and it wuz carried yoonan­  
imously. It wood hev been well hed I  
stopi&gt;od here, hut I didn&#x27;t. My prevailin  
weakness is to slop over, and I slopt on  
this okkashen fearfully. I called upon the  
citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith  
by their works. “ There are,” I said, in a

kin descent. Let era step forred on this  
platform—let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pen­  
nibacker, Bascom, Isakeor Gavitt and eigh­  
teen other white citizens step forred, also.  
Let them clasp each other by the hand  
while I ware over them the flag of our  
common kontry.”  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated  
advanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I was about to ware when  
Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to wait a  
minit till he had made his remark. The  
site before him almost moved him to tears.  
Ef ho hed ever harbored a suspishen that  
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Ken­  
tucky breast, he took it all back. The  
aeshun uv to nito wuz not only Just but it  
wuz generous.  
“Generous!” said I, “whygenerous?”  
“ Becoz,” said lie, “ the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way ef you hedn’t deci­  
ded on given era their rites uv your own  
akkord, for there ain&#x27;t no power now that  
can compel you to doit. Ijist got a North­  
ern paper—alas ! the Rcpuhlikin party is  
split into fragments, remarkably small  
fragments. Grant assaulied Sumner in the  
Capitol last Monday; Logan has been  
stoned by the Rcpuhlikins uv Philadelfy  
on his way home ; the Central Committees  
of Ohio, Injeany and Illinois hev divided,  
and each fraeshen has called a convcnshun,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under hevin kin  
prevent the success uv the Dimikratic can­  
didate for the Presidency, no matter who  
he may be or wot platform he is put onto.  
In view of the dissolooshcn uv the Repub­  
likin party, and the fact that the niggers  
ain’t now got no protectors, its really gen­  
erous that yoo ”  
“ The Republikin party is gone to pieces,  
hez it?” gasped my twenty-two white  
friends in korious.  
“ It hez,” responded Bigler.  
“Then,” said Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashing with unwontid fire, “what we’ve  
done and sed don’t count 1 Take that, you  
black cuss.”  
And with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, tho Deekin  
fecht the darkey whose hand he had been  
graspin, a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which histed him clean off the plat­  
form. The others followed suit, aud in  
their zeal sprung off the platform after era,  
aud wuz a cxecutin war dances uv the most  
frantic descripshen unto their prostrate  
bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock  
and Bigler restrained em from taken uv em  
out and hangin uv em.  
Ez matter uv course the resolooshcn wuz  
recinded, and others adopted affirrain our  
adherence to the Constitution ez it yoost  
to be, the illegality uv the amendments,  
and the natural soopremacy uv the white  
man over the d—d uigger, after which wo  
adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our custom,  
and there organized fresh raids onto our  
natural enemies.  
The next moruiu I noticed a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler’s face, likewise on Pollock’s.  
They grinned at me as I passed with a  
broadnis I coodent account for. Lubbock,  
the nigger postmaster, bust into a roor as I  
walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded  
the reason of his hilarity.  
“ Dat mistake oh Bigler’s,” returned he,  
laughing louder than before.  
“ What mistake ?” I asked, turning pale,  
for suspicion was creepin over me.  
“ Why, he didn’t get no paper at all,  
and—”  
“ And all that story about the split iu  
the Rcpublikin party North wuz one uv his  
infernal lies?”  
“ Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de  
&#x27;case 1” replied the nigger, showing his  
ivories.  
“ Bigler wanted too see ef your pentance  
wuz genooine—dat’s all dah wuz ob it.—  
He ’sprest desire to assortane jist how  
peccable yood be to do nigger and do  
Northern people down heah, ef da wuzn&#x27;t  
Publikin party up North to hold yoo ; dat  
wuz all.”  
And the nigger laffed a fiendish laff.  
That wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found  
out all he wanted to. Uv coorse this  
“outrage” as they will call it, will git into  
the Northern papers, and uv coorse Vallan­  
dygum’s assershun will explode without  
hurting anybody. Joe Bigler is my evil  
genius. I shel never be able to run things  
ez I want to so long ez he lives.
