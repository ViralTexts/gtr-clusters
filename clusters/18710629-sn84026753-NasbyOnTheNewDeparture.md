Nasby on the New Departure.**  
  
[From the Toledo Blade.]  
  
Confederate X Roads, (wich iz in the State of Kentucky, May 24, 1871)  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the politikle field satisfied me, some months ago, that without some shift in the position uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedingly thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Vallandygham into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisiy uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand even so sudden a change ez that! Wat I want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin outside the offices uv assessor and collector are actooatid by the same high and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so simple a process ez passin resolooshens indoose enuff dissatisfied Republikins in the close Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic President who will give us these boons, we three are for passin these resolooshens no matter what they are. This bein my understandin uv Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it to wunst.  
  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Corners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That I mite get em all at one time, I waited till the regler evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good humor and ready to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very short but a very satisfactry consultashen. There wuz some objickshuns on the part uv Dimocratic idees, but Bascom settled their hash in very short metre. He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the offfises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the fullest freedom uv though and ackshen, and that every one shood express hisself untrammeled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him on that question, let him make hisself known. No sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to object dropt ez though they hed bin shot.  
  
It wuz determined to hold a public meetin the next nite at the church to make a public endorsement uv Vallandygum&#x27;s idees.  
  
Ez the principal objict uv the meetin wuz to convins the Republikins uv the doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the South really accepted the situashun, and ment, in ded ernest, to recognize the great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to hev all the niggers uv the Corners present, and saved for them the best seats in the ouse. Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I coodent help.  
  
I opened the exercises by making a short speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the time hed finally arriv when the lion and the lamb hed lain down together, and a small child wuz leading uv em. I knowed thet our colored fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yoosed, and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North, Vallandygum, hed spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy, and from this time henceforth and forever there wuz to be nothin but peece. I then offered the follerin resolooshen:  
  
&quot;*Resolved*, That the Dimocrisy uv the Yoonited States recognize the legality uv all the amendments made to the Constitooshen dooring and since the late onpleasantnis, and that they recognise and most heartily acquiesce in all the results uv the war; that they not only withdraw all their opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, but pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively by the Caucashen.&quot;  
  
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev been well hed I stopped there, but I didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekness is to slop over, and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, in a spasm of delite, &quot;preset at this meetin twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin descent. Let em step forred on this platform--let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Issaker Gavitt, and eighteen other white citizens step forred also. Let them clasp each other by the hand while I wave over em a flag uv our common kontry.&quot;  
  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers stepped forred, the whites designated advanced, the two lines grasped each other by the hand, and I was about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize. He begged me to wait a minnit till he made his remark. The site afore him moved him almost to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz generous.  
  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for ther ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern paper--alas! the Republikin party is split into fragments--remarkably small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by the Republikins uv Philadelfy on his way home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany, and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz called a convenshen, and the Noo York *Triboon* throws up the sponge and sez that nothin under the hevin can prevent the success uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, no matter who he may be or wat platform he is put onto. In view uv the disolooshen uv the Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no perteckers, it&#x27;s really generous that yoo--&quot;  
  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces! hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends in korious.  
  
&quot;It hez!&quot; responded Bigler.  
  
&quot;Then,&quot; said Deekin Pogram, his eyes flashin with unwonted fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss?&quot;  
  
And with a strength and activity which I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin fecht the darkey whose hand he hed bin graspin, a most powerful blow atween the eyes which histed him clean off the platform, the others followed soot, and in their zeal sprang off the platform after em, and wuz a executin war dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto their prostrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from takin uv em out and hanging uv em.  
  
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen wuz recinded, and others adopted affirm our adherence to the constitooshen ez it yoost to be, the illegality uv the amendments, and the nateral soopremacy uv the white man over the d--d nigger, after wich we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom, and there organized fresh raids onto our nateral enemies.  
  
The next morning I noticed a pecoolyer look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the nigger postmaster, bust into a roar ez I walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded the reason for his hilarity.   
  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Biglers,&quot; returned he, laughing louder than before.  
  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turning pale, for a suspishen was creepin over me.  
  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and--&quot;  
  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the Republikin party North wuz one uv his infernal lies!&quot;  
  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case!&quot; replied the nigger, showin all his ivories. &quot;Bigler want to see ef yoor &#x27;pentance wuz genoeine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob it. He sprest a desire to assertane jist how peeceable yood be to de nigger and de Northern people down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no &#x27;Publikin party up North to hold yoo; dat wuz all.&quot;  
  
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.  
  
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out all that he wanted to. Uv cours this &#x27;outrage,&#x27; ez they call it, will get into the Northern papers, and uv cours Vallandygum&#x27;s assershun will explode itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Bigler iz my evil genius. I shel never be able to run things ez i want to so long ez he lives.

A calm and comprehensive survey uv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position av the  
Limocricy, our hope uv success was exceed­  
ingly thin. The resolcoshens, introdoost by  
Vallandygum into the convenshun uv the  
Dimocrisy uv Monrgomery County, Ohio, wuz  
to me a new lite. Troo, they hev the alite dis­  
advantage uv abjcorin everything that is Dim­  
ocratic, and uv puttin the Dimocratic party on  
purely Repnblikin ground, but wat of that?  
I kin stand even so sudden a change ex  
that. Wat I want is the sooprome  
har piness of kickin that nigger Lud­  
bock cut uy the postomfis at the  
Corners, and uv puttin myself hi his place,  
and Eernel McDelter and Elder Pennibacker  
who hey bin languishin outeide the effices uv  
aseessor and collector are actocated by the  
game high and holy impulecs. Ef to do this  
requires the okkepyin uv Ropublican ground  
the war ciy uv us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Ken­  
ucky is shoor to go Dimecratic anyhow, and  
if we kin by so simple a proceas ez passin  
resolooshens indoose enuff dissatisfind Re­  
publikins in the close northern States to vote  
with us to elimt a Democratic president who  
will give us thesy boons, we three are for  
malts wat they  
are. This ein my understandin   
dygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocracy uv the Corners  
together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That I mife  
get em all at one time, I waited till the regter  
evenin for the raid on the niggers and North­  
ern settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin  
thar, on their return, they&#x27;d all stop at Bas­  
com&#x27;s for a drink, and that, ef they&#x27;d bin suc­  
ecesful in their hanging and burnin, they&#x27;d be  
in good humor and ready to adopt anything I  
shood euggest. It wuz a very short but a  
very satlefactory consultashen. There was  
some objickshuns on the part av a few  
to wat thry called an abandonment  
 Dimocrati ide but ascom settled  
 their hach in very short meter, tHe  
romarkt that it wuz neceesary that the  
offises be in the hands uv his friends for  
obvius reasons. He wantid bay and he  
knowed uv no other way to git it. He be­  
leeved in the fulfest freedom uv thought and  
ackehen, and that every one shood express  
 hisself untrameled, but he coodent abide a  
idiot. If there wuz any one in that assem­  
blage so stoopid as to differ with him on this  
question, let him make hisself known. No  
etch man shood ever get a drop at his bar,  
never; sich a one wuz not deservin hv even  
the commonest nesesaries uv life. Several  
who had riz to their feet to object, dropt ez  
though they hed been shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a puiblic meetin  
the next nite at the church to make a public  
 endoreement uy Vallandygum&#x27;s Idea.  
Ez the prinsiple objick of the meetin wuz to  
convins the Republikins uv the doubtful states  
that the Dimocrisy uy the South really accept­  
id the situashen, and meant, in dead earnest,  
to recognise the great prinsiple uv equality,  
I arranged to hev all the niggers uv the  
Corners present, and saved for em the best  
seats in the houss. Joo Bigler and Pollock  
come, uv course, which I coodent help.  
I opened the exerciees by making a short  
speech ez I took the chair. I rejotst that the  
time hed finally arriv when the lion and the  
lamb hed layed down together and a amall  
child was a leadin uv em. I knowd that our  
colored fellow-citizens hed bin dispitefully  
yoosed, and that doo reepeck hed not bin alluz  
paid to our fellow-citixens uv the North, but  
 that time hed now passed and I hoped forev­  
er. The Dimocrisy uv the North, through  
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they hed accepted  
 the situashen, hallelongy, and from this time  
hencsforth and forever thers wuz to be noth­  
in but reece:  
Resolved, That the Dimocrisy of the Yoc-  
 cited States recognize the legality ny all the  
amendments made to the constitocshen deorin  
ard since the late onpleasantnis, and that they  
recognize and most heartily acquiesce in all  
 the results of the war; that they not only  
withdraw all their opposishen to yooniversal  
auffrage, but pledge theirselves to eee that  
ao Akin eowcitien e not on  
ei e a oe i e  eo e  
clcosively by the Caucashen.  
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv  
the resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoonani­  
muely. It wood av bin well hed I stopped  
lere, but I didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weak­  
nees is to slop over, and I slopt on this  
okkasion fearfully. I called upon the citi­  
zens ny the Corners to prove their faith  
by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, in a  
 sprem of delite, &quot;present at this meetin  
twentyto of u our fellow-citizens uv Afri­  
kin dercent. Let em step forred on this piat­  
form--let Deekin Pogram, Elder Peuniback­  
er, Bascom, fasaker Gavitt, and eighteen oth­  
er white citizens step forrerd also. Let them  
clasp each other by the hand, while I wave  
over em the flag of our common kentry.&quot;  
It was done. The twenty-two niggers step­  
ped forred, the whites designated advanced,  
the two lines grasped each other by the hand,  
and I was about to wave, when Joo Bigler riz.  
He begged me to wait a minit till he hed  
made hir remark. The site afore him moved  
him almost tu teers. Ef he had harbared a  
ensrishen that there wuxn&#x27;t anything gener­  
ous in the Kentucky breast he took it all  
back. The action uv to-nite wuz not only just  
but it wuz generous.  
&quot;Generens!&quot; sed I. &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, &quot;the niggers wood be in  
a devilish bad way ef you hedn&#x27;t decided on  
givin ent their rites, uv yoor own own akkord,  
for there aln&#x27;t no power now that kin compel  
yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern paper,  
alas! the Republikin party is eplit into trag­  
mants- remarkably small fragments. Grant  
aesaulted Samner in the Capitol, last Mor­  
day, Logan hez been stoned by tho Ropub­  
likins of Thiladelfy on his way home, the  
Central Committees uv Ohio, Injeany and I­  
hney, hev divided, and each frackshen her  
called a Convenshen, and the Noo York Triboo  
threws up the spenge and ses that nothin un­  
der hevin kin prevent the saccess uv the  
Democratic candidate for the Presidency; no  
matter who he may be or wat platform he is  
pnt onto. In view of the dissolboshen uv the  
Rapublikin party, and the fact that the nig-  
gers ain&#x27;t now got no perteckters, its really  
generous that yoc,-  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces!  
hee it? gaeped my twenty-two white friends  
in kCriOns.  
&quot;It her!&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Dexkin Pogram, his eyes fiash­  
in with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve done and  
sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, yoo black cusa!&quot;  
And with the strongth and activity wich I  
hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the deekin fecht  
the darkey, whose hand he hed binigraspin, a  
most powerful blow atween the eyes wich hict  
ed him clean off the platform. The others  
follered soot, and in their zeal sprung off the  
platform after em, and wur a executin war  
dances uv the most frantic descrioshen onto  
prostrate bodies. It wun with difficulty that  
Pellock and Biglar restrzined em from takin  
ny em out and hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resolution wur  
rascinded, and others adopted affirmin our ad­  
herence to the constooshen es it yoost to  
be, the illegality nv the amendments, and the  
natural spopremacy uv the white man over  
the d--d nigger, after wich we adjourned to  
Bascom&#x27;s, es is our custom, and there organ­  
ized fresh raids onto our naterai enemies,  
The next mornin I notised a pecoolyer look  
on Bigker&#x27;s face, and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s,  
They grinned at me ez I passed, with a broad­  
his wich I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock,  
the nigger Postmaster, burst into a roar ez I  
walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded  
the reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned he,  
laughing londer than before.  
&quot;What mistake,&quot; I asked, turnin pale, for  
a suspicien was creepin over me.  
Why, he didn&#x27;t gat no paper at all, and--&quot;  
And all that story about the split in the  
Repubhican party North was one uv his infer­  
nal liss!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case?&quot;  
replied the nigger, sho win all his iveries.  
&quot;Bigler wanted to see if your pentanos wat  
  
The OHICaGo ThiBUne, Tuesday, JunE s s  
  
genooine--dat&#x27;s about all dab wuz ob it. He  
&#x27;sprest a desirs to ansertane jist how paeces­  
ble vood be to de nigger and de Northern peo­  
ple down hezh, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no Publican  
party up North to hold yoo; dat wun all.  
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guees the cues found ont  
all that he wanted to. Uv cuurse this &quot;out­  
rage,&quot; ez they will call it, will get into the  
Northern papers, and ny course Yallandy­  
gum&#x27;s assarshun will explode itself withont  
hurtin anybody. Joe Bigler is my evil gomins.  
I shel never be able two run things ez I want  
to so long ex he lives.

May 25, 1871.  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey  
uv the politikle field satisfied me,  
tome months ago, that without some  
shift in the position of the Dimocracy,  
oar how uv success wuz exceedingly  
thin. The rezolooshens interdoost by  
Vallandygum into the Convenshun of  
the Dimocracy uv aionigumery coun­  
ty, Ohio, wuz to me a new lite. Troo,  
thev have the slite disadvantage uv  
abloorin everthlng that is Dimocratic,  
and uv tuttin the Dimocratic party  
on purely .Republican ground, but wat  
uv that 7 1 kin 8 tan a even so suaain  
a change ez that. Wat I want is the  
soopreme happiness uv kickin that  
nigger Lubbock out nv the postofSs at  
the Corners, ana uv puiun myseu in  
his place, and Kernal McPelter and  
Elder Pennibacker who hev bin lan-  
guittbin outside the offises nv Assessor  
and Collector, are actooatid by the  
same hieh and holy impulses. Ef to  
do this requires the ockepyin of Ke-  
nublickin around, tne war cry uv us  
three is &quot;ockepy.&quot; Kentucky is shoor  
to go Democratic anyhow, and if we  
kin by so simple a process ez passin  
resoioosbens indoose enun aissausnea  
BeDublicklns in the close Northern  
states to rote with us to elect a Dimo  
cratic President who will give us these  
boons, we three are for passin tnese  
resoioosbens no matter what they are.  
This being my understands uv Val­  
landygnm&#x27;s movement, I acted onto it  
to wunst.  
I got the leadin Dimocracy uv the

and burn in they&#x27;d be in good humor  
and ready to adopt anytinncr i snooa  
ufcesL It was a very short consul  
taxhun but very satisfactry. There  
wuz some objecahuns on the part of a  
few to what they called an abandon  
ment nv Dimocratic ideas, but Bas  
com settled their hash in very shaft  
meter. He remarkt that it wuz neces  
sary that the offises be in the hands of  
his friends lor odvious reasons, lie  
wantid pay and he knowed uv no oth  
er war to rit it. He believed in the  
fullest freedom uv thought and act  
sben. and that every one shood ex  
press himself untrameled, but he  
coodn&#x27;t abide a idiot. If there wuz  
any one in theassemblitre so stupid ez  
to difler with him on this question, let  
him make nisaeit Known, rso sich  
man ever shood Bit a drop at his bar.  
never: sich a man wnz not deservin  
uv even the commonest necessaries uv  
life. Several who had riz to their feet  
to obiect, dropt ez though they hed  
bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public  
meetin tne next nite at tne cnurcn to  
make a public endorsement of ullan  
dyeum&#x27;s idea.  
tne prinsinie od ick oi me meet  
in wuz to convins the Republicans uv  
tiie doubtful States that the Dimocra  
cv uv the South really acceptid the  
situashen, and ment, in dead earnest,  
to recornlze Ui irreat principle uv  
equality. I arranged to have all the  
nircers uv the Corners present, and  
saved for em the best seats in the  
house Joe. Bigler and Pollock come,  
uv course, wich I coodn&#x27;t help.  
I opened the exercises by makiu  
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-  
a leaden uv em. I knowd that our  
colored fellow-citizens hed been dis-  
pitefully yoosed, and that doo respeck  
tied not been alluz paid to our fellow-  
citizens of the North, but that time  
hed now passed and I hoped forever.  
The Dimocracy of the North, through  
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they hed  
accepted the situashen, halleloogy.and  
irom mis lime nenceiortn and toreve&#x27;  
there;wua to be nothing but peece. I  
then offered thefollerin resolooshen:  
Heolved, That the Dimocrisy of the  
Yoonlted States recognize the legality  
uv all the amendments made to the  
Constitooshen door in and since the  
onpleasantnis, and most heartily ac  
quiesce in all the results uv the war  
that they not only withdraw all their  
oppossihen to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that eur  
Airikin fellow-citizens hev not only  
this right but all others heretofore en­  
joyed excloosively by the Caucaben.  
I put the question ez to the adop  
uui uv uie raKuoosneen, ana ll wuz  
carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev  
bin well bed I stopped here, but I  
didn&#x27;t. My prevaiiu weekness is to  
slop over and I slopt on this okkashen  
leariuiiy. l called upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to prove their faith bv  
their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said in a  
spasm of delite, present at this meet  
in iwetiy-two uv our fellow-citizens  
nv Afrikin descent. Let em steo  
Kirreru on itiia piaiform let lJeeRln

Issaker Gavitt and eighteen other  
white citizens steobed forrerd. also.  
Let em clasp each other by the hand  
while I wave over em the flag &quot;V our  
common ken try.&quot;  
It wnz done. The twenty twa nig­  
gers stepped forred, the whites desig­  
nated advanced, the two lines trasoed  
each other by the hand, and I wnz  
about to wave, when Joe Bigler riz.  
He begged me to wait a minit till he  
had made his remark. The site afore  
him moved him almost to tecra. f &#x27;.r  
he had ever harbored a susoisien that.  
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the  
neniucKy oreast tie took it all back  
The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not onl v

uv yoor own akkord fox there ain&#x27;t no

## [From _New Orleans Republican._](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83016555/1871-06-11/ed-1/?sp=6)

%  
A calm and comprehensive survey nv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv  
the Diinocricy, our hope uv success was ex­  
ceedingly thin. The resoloosbens introdoost  
by Vallandygum into the convenshua uv  
the Dimocrisy uv Montgomery county,  
Ohio, wuz to ine a new lite. Troo, they  
hev the elite disadvantage uv abjoonn  
every thing that is Ditnocratic, and  
uv puttin the Dimoeratic party on  
purely ltepublikin ground; but wat ol that?  
I kin stand even so sudden a change as that.  
YVat I want is the soopreme happiness of  
kiekin that nigger Lubbock out of the post­  
offis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in  
his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder  
Pennibackpr, who liev been languishin out­  
side the ottiises uv assessor and collector,  
are actooated by tbe same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the okke­  
pvin uv Republican ground, the war cry uv  
us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky :s shoor  
to go Dimecrutic aryliow, aud it we kin by  
so simple a process ez passin resoloosbens  
indoose enutt&#x27;dissatistied Republikins in the  
close Northern States to vote with us to  
elect a Democratic president who will give  
us these boons, we three are for passin these  
resoloosbens,no matter wat they are. ibis  
bein my uuderstandin uv Y allaudygum s  
movement, I actid onto it to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimoericy uv the Cor­  
ners together one nite at Baseom&#x27;s. That I  
mite get era all at one time, I waited till the  
regler evenin for the raid on the niggers  
and Northern settlers up toards Garcetts­  
town, kiiowin that, on ther return, they&#x27;d  
all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that,  
ef the&#x27;d bin successful in their haugin and  
buruin, they&#x27;d be iu good humor and ready  
to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz  
a very short but a very satisfactory consul­  
tasheu. There was some objeekshus on the  
partuvafewto wat they called an aban­  
donment uv Dimoeratic ideas, but Bascom  
settled their hash in very short meter. He  
remarked that it wuz necessary that the  
offise8 lie in the hands uv his friends lor  
ohvlus reasons. He wantid pay and he  
knowed uv no other way to git ic. He be­  
leeved in the fullest ifeedom uv thought  
and ackshen, and that every one shood ex­  
press hisself untrameled, but he coodent  
abide a idiot. It&#x27; there wuz any one in that  
assemblage so stoopid as to differ with him  
on this question, let him make hisself  
known. No sick man shood ever get a drop  
at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not de­  
servin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv  
life. Several who liad riz to their feet to  
object, dropt ez though thev hed been shot.  
It wuz determined to kohl a public rneetin  
the next nite at the church to make a pub­  
lic endorsement of Y&#x27;allandygum&#x27;s idea.  
Ez the priusiple objick of the meetin wuz  
to convius the Republikins uv tlie doubtful  
states that the Dimoericy of the South really  
aeceptid the situashen, and meant, iu dead  
earnest, to recognise the great priusiple uv  
equality, 1 arranged to have all the niggers  
uv the Corners present, aud saved for era  
the best seats iu the house. Joe Bigler aud  
Pollock come, uv course, which I coodent  
help.  
I opened the exercises by making a short  
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist that  
the time had finally arriv when the lion aud  
the lamb hed layed down together anil a  
small child was a leadin uv em. I knowd  
that onr colored teller-citizens hed been die­  
pitefully voosed. and that doo respeck bed  
not bin alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv  
the North, but that time hed now passed  
and I hoped forever. The Dimoericy uv  
the North, through Y&#x27;allaudyguin, bed spoke,  
they hed accepted the situashen, halleloogy,  
anil from this time henceforth anil forever  
there wuz to be nothin but peeee.  
Ur sol red. That the Dimoericy uv the  
Y&#x27;oonited States recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the cous&#x27;titoo­  
shen doorin and since the late onph-asant­  
nis, and that they recognize and most  
heartily acquiesce in all the results of the  
war; that they not only w ithdraw all their  
opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, lint  
pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin  
fellow-citizens hev not only this but all  
other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively  
by the Caucashen.  
I pnt the question ez to the adopshen uv  
the resolushen, and it wuz carried yoonani­  
mouslv. It wood av bin well lied I stopped  
here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. Mv prevaliu weakness  
is to slop over, aud I slopped on this ukka­  
sion fearfully. I called upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to prove their faith by their  
works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, iu a spasm uv  
delite, &quot;present at this meetin twenty-two  
uv our fellow citizens uv Afrikin descent.  
Let em step forrerd on this platform—let  
Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibaeker. Bas­  
com, Issacker Gavitt, aud eighteen other  
white citizens step forrerd also. Let them  
clasp each other by the hand, while I wave  
over em the flag of our common kentrv.&quot;  
It was done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forrerd, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other by  
the hand, aud I was about to wave, when  
J&lt;^&gt; Bigler riz. He begged me to wait a  
minit till he hed made Ins remark. The site  
atore him moved him almost tu teers. Ef  
he hed harbored a suspiskeu that there  
wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky  
breast, he took it all hack. The action uv  
to-uite wuz not only just but it wuz gen­  
erous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;wby generous ?&quot;  
&quot;Beeoz,&quot; sed lie, &quot;the niggers wood lie in  
a devilish bad way ef you hedn&#x27;t decided on  
givin em their rites, uv yoor own akkord,  
tor there ain&#x27;t no power&quot;no\v that kin com­  
pel yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern pa­  
per—alas! the Repnldikiu partv is split mto  
tragments—remarkably small fragments.  
Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol, last  
Monday, Logan hez been stoned by tbe Re­  
publikins ot Philadelfv on his wav Lome,  
tbe Central Committees uv Ohio. Injeany  
and IUinev, hev divided, and each fraeksheu  
liez called a Convenshen, and the Noo Y&#x27;ork  
Triboon throws up tlie sponge and sez that  
nothin under Ilevin kin prevent tbe sukeess  
uv the Diuiocritic candidate for the Presi­  
dency; no matter who he may be, or wat  
platform he is put onto. In view of tlie dis­  
solooshen uv the Repuhlikin party, and the  
fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no per  
teekters, its really generous that voo--&quot;  
&quot;The ltepublikin party is gone&quot; to pieces !  
hez it ?&quot; gasped my tweutv-two white  
triends in korious.  
  
&quot; It hez !&quot; responded Bigler.  
tt J I| I &#x27; hen &#x27;-.i ?ed Deekin Pogram, his eves  
tlashm with unwontm tire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t couut! Take that, vou  
blackcu8s!&quot; &#x27; -  
And with the strength and activity wieh  
I hailn t lookt tor in one so agid, the deekin  
ietcht the darkey, whose hand he had ben  
graspra, a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes wieh lusted him clean off the platform  
lhe others lollered soot, and in their zeai  
sprung off the platform after em. and wuz  
a executm war dances uv the must frantic  
desermshen onto prostrate bodies. It wuz

A calm and comprehensive survey uv  
the politikle field satisfied me, some  
months ago, that with some shift in the  
position uv the Dimocrisv, our hope uv  
success wuz cxeeedinly thin. The reso­  
looshens interdoost by&#x27; Vallandygum into  
the Convenshun of the Dimocrisy uv Mont­  
gomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new  
ife. Troo, they her the slite disadvan­  
tage uv adjooring everythin that is Dinto­  
cratic, and uv puttin the Dimoeratic party  
on Kepublikin ground, but wat uv that? I  
kin stand even so sudden a change ez that  
Wat I want is the soopreme happiness uv  
kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the  
postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin my­  
self in his place, and Kernel MePelter and  
Elder Pennibacker who hev bin languish­  
in outside the offices uv Assessor and  
Collector are actooated by the same high  
and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires  
the okkepyin uv Kepublikin ground, the  
war cry uv us three is “okkepy.” Ken­  
tucky is shoor to go Democratic anyhow,  
and if we kin by so simple a process ez  
pass in resolooshens indoose enutf dissatis­  
fied Kepublikins in the close Northern  
States to vdte with us to elect a Democrat­  
ic President who will give us these boons,  
we three are for passin these resolooshens  
no matter wat they are. This bein my  
understandin uv Vailandygum&#x27;s movement  
I acted onto it to wunst.  
I got the leadin Dimmoerisy of the  
Cornets together one nite at liascom&#x27;s.  
That I mite get em all at one time, I wait­  
ed till the regler evenin for the raid on  
the niggers and northern settlers up to­  
wards Garrettstown, knowin that on their  
return they’d all stop at liascom&#x27;s for a  
drink, and that ef they’d bin successful in  
their hangin and burnin they’d be in good  
humor and ready to julopt anythin I shood  
suggest. It wuz a short but very satisfac­  
try consultashen. There wuz some ob­  
jickshuns on the part uv a few, to wat they  
called an abandonment uv Dimoeratic  
idees, but llaseom settled their hash in  
very short metre. Ife remarkt that it wuz  
necessary that the offises be in the hands  
uv his friends for obvius reasons. He  
wantid pay and lie kuowed uv no other  
way to git it. lie beleeved in the fullest  
freedom uv thought and ackshen, and that  
every one shood express hisself untram­  
meled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If  
there wuz any one in that assemblage so  
stupid ez to differ with him on ttiat ques­  
tion, let him make hisself known. No  
sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar,  
never; sich a one wuz notdeservin of even  
the commonest nesessaries uv life. Seve­  
ral who lied riz to their feet to object  
dropt ez though they lied bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meet­  
in the next nite at the church to make a  
public endorsement uv Yallandygum’s  
idees.  
  
J&#x27;.z me pnnsipai object uv the meetin  
wuz to convins the Kepublikius uv the  
doubtful Suites that the Pimoerasy uv the  
South really accepted the situashou, and  
nient, in tied earnest, to recognize the  
great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to  
hev all the niggers uv the Corners present  
and saved for ent the best seats in the  
house. Joe Bigler and Pollock cum uv  
eoorse, which L coodent help.  
1 opened Ihe exercises by makin a short  
speech ez I took the chair. L rejoist that  
the time had finally arriv when the lion  
and the lamb bed layed down together,  
and a small child wuz a leadin uv cm. I  
knowed that our colored fellow-citizens  
lied bin dispitefully yoosed, and that doo  
respeek hed not bin alluz paid to our fel­  
low-citizens uv the North, but that time  
hed now passed, aud 1 hoped forever.  
The Pimocrisy uv the North, through  
Yallandygum, hed spoke, they hed ac­  
cepted the situashen, halleloogv, and from  
this time henceforth and forever there  
wuz to lie nothiu but peace. 1 then offer­  
ed the following resotooshen:  
Resolved. That the Pimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States, recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the Consti­  
toosheu dooring and since the late on­  
pleasantnis, and that they recognize and  
most heartily acquiesce in all the results  
uv the war; that they not only withdraw  
all their opposhen to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our Afri­  
kin fellow-citizens hev not only tills but  
all other rites heretefore enjoyed cxeloo­  
sively by the Caucashen.  
  
1 put the question ez to the aitopshen uv  
the resoloosheu, and it wuz carried yoo­  
nauimusly. It wood liev bin well bed I  
stopped here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. My prevalin  
weekness is to slop over and I slopt on  
this okknsion uv the Corners to prove their  
faith by their works. ‘There are,’ I said,  
in a spasm of delitc, ‘present at this  
meetin twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens  
uv Afrikin descent. Let cm step forred  
on this platform—let Deckin Togram,  
Elder Pennibacker.Uascom, IssakerGavitt  
and eighteen other white citizens step for­  
red. also. Let them clasp each other by  
the hand while I wave over em the flag uv  
our common kentry.’  
It was done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I wuz about to wave,  
when Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to  
wait a rninit till lie had made his remark.  
The site afore him moved him almost to  
teers. Kf he lied ever harbored a suspish­  
eu that there wuzn’t anything generous in  
the Kentucky breast, lie took it all back.  
The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not only just,  
but it was generous.  
“Generous!” sed I, “ why generous?”  
“Becoz,” sed he, “the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way cf yoo liedn’t decided  
on givin em their rites, uv yoor own ak­  
kord, for there aiut no power now that kin  
compel yoo to do it. i jist got a northern  
paper—alas! the Kepublikin party is split  
  
into fragments—remarkably small frag­  
ments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the  
Capitol last Monday, Logan hez bin ston­  
ed by the Ilepublkins uv Philadelfy on his  
way home, the Central Committees uv  
Ohio, Injeny and lllinoy, hev divided, and  
each ftackshen hez called a convenshen,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under heven  
kin prevent the success uv the Democratic  
candidate for the Presidency, no matter  
who he may be or wat platform he is pi^t  
onto. In view uv the dissolooshen uv the  
Republikin party, and the fact that the  
niggers aint how got no perteckters, its  
really generous that voo——”  
“The Republikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it? gapped my twentjySW white  
friends in korious.” &quot;  
“It hez.” responded &#x27;  
“Then,&quot; sed Deekin Ingram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, “What we’ve  
done and sed don’t count! Take that, you  
black cuss!” t ( -*  
Ami with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin  
feclit the darkey whose hand he hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which lusted him clean off the plat­  
form. The others follered soot, and in  
their zeal sprang off the platform after eni,  
and wuz a exeeutin war dances uv the  
most frantic descripshen onto their pros­  
trate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that  
Pollock and Bigler restrained em from  
takin uv em out and hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen  
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirmiu  
our adherence to the constooshen ez it  
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­  
ments, and the nateral soopremaPy uv the  
white man over the d—d nigger, after wich  
we adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our cus­  
tom, and there organized fresh raids onto  
our natural enemies.  
The next mornin I notised a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pol­  
lock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed,  
with a broadnis I couldn’t account for.  
Lubbock, the nigger Postmaster, bust into  
a roor ez I walked into his offis, and I an­  
grily demandid the reason for his hilarity.  
“Dat mistake of Bigler’s,” returned he,  
laughin’ louder than before.  
“What mistake?” I asked, turnin pale,  
for a suspishun wuz creepin over me.  
“Why, he didn’t get no papers at all,  
and—’’  
  
“Anil all that story about that split in  
the Republiken party North wuz one uv  
his infernal lies!’’  
“Dat&#x27;s about lie correct state ob de case!”  
replied the nigger showin all his ivories,  
“liigler wanted to see ef yoor pentance  
wuz &quot;enooine—dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob  
it. lie ’sprest a desire to assertane jist  
how peeceable yood be to de nigger and  
do Northern people down heali, ef dah  
wuzn’t no Tublikin party up North to hold  
yoo; dat wuz all.”  
And the nigger luffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all!” he repeated.  
It wuz euuff. I guess the cuss found out  
all that he wanted to. Uv course this ‘out­  
rage,’ cz they call it, will get into the  
Northern papers, and uv course Vallandy­  
gum’s assershuns will explode itself with­  
out hurtiu anybody. Joe Bigler is my  
evil genius. 1 she! never be able to ruu  
things ez I want to so long ez he lives.

(FrOm tHE TOlEdO BlAdE.)  
Mr. Nasby and his Friends Second the  
Movement of Vallandigham-A Meet  
ing in which Mr. Joseph Bigter Takes  
a PART- The Resut-  
ConFedrit A Rcads,  
(Wich is in the State uv Kentucky.)  
May 24, 1871.  
A cam and comprehensive survey uv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months  
ago, that without some shift in the posish­  
un uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success  
wuz exceedinly thin. The resolnoshens in­  
terdoost by Vallandygum into the Conven­  
shun uv the Dimocrisy uv Montgomery  
County. Ohio, wuz to me a new lite. Troo,  
they hev the slite disadvantage uv abjoorin  
evervthing that is Dimocratic and uv put­  
tin the Dimocratic party on purelv Repuh­  
likin ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand  
even so sudden a change ez that. Wat I  
want, is the snopreme happiness ov kickin  
that nigger Luhhock out uv the post offis at  
the Corners, and uv puttin myself in his  
place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pen­  
nihacker, who hev bin languishin outside  
the offices uv Assesser and Collcter, are  
actooatid by the same high and holv im  
pulse. Ef to do this requires the okkepv-  
a uy Republikin ground, the war cry uv  
us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky is shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin.  
by so simple a process ez passin resolno­  
shens, indoose enuff d&#x27;ssatisfied Repub i-  
kins in the close Northern States to vate  
with us to elect a Dimocratic President who  
will give us these boons we three are for  
passin these resolooshens, no matter wat  
they are. This bein my understandin uv  
Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it  
to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocracy uv the Cor  
ners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That  
I mite git em all at one time, I waited till  
the regler evenin for the raid on the nig­  
gers and Northern settlers up toards Gar­  
rettstown, knowin that on their return  
they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and  
that ef they&#x27;d hin successful in ther hangin  
and hurnin, they&#x27;d he in good humor, and  
reddy to adopt anything I shood sejest.  
It wuz a very short but a very satisfactory  
consultashen. Ther wuz some objeckshuns  
on the part uv a faw to wat they called a  
ahandonment uv Dimocratic ijees, but Bas­  
com settled ther hash in very short metre.  
He remarkt that it wuz nesessary that the  
o&#x27;fises be in the hands uv hit frends, for  
obvius reasons. He wantid pay, and he  
knowed uv no other way to git it. H  
beleeved in the fullest freedoum uv thought  
and ackshen, and that every one shood ex­  
press hisself untrameled, but he coodent  
abide a idiot. If ther wuz any one in that  
assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him  
on this question, let him make hisself  
known. No sich man shood ever git a drop  
at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not de­  
servin uv even the commonest nesesaries  
ny life. Several who hed riz to ther feet  
to object, dropt ez tho they hed hin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meet­  
in the next nite, at the church, to make a  
public endorsement uv Vallandygum&#x27;s ijee.  
Ez the prinsiple objeck uv the meetin  
wuz to convins the Republikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the  
South really acceptid the situashen, and  
meant, in ded ernest, to recognize the  
grate prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to  
hev all the niggers uv the Corners present,  
and saved for em the best seats in the  
house. Joe Bigler and Pollock come, uv  
coarse, wich I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by makin a short  
speech ez I took the cheer. I rejoist that  
the time hed finally arriv when the lion and  
the lamb hed layed down together, and a  
small child wuz a leadin uv em. I knowd  
phest any wolored ellgrecatinens he bin is  
voosed, and that doo respeck hed  
not hin alluz paid to our feller-citizens uv  
the North, but that time hed now passed,  
and I hoped forever. The Dimocrisy uv  
the North, throo Vallandygum, hed spoke;  
they hed accepted the situashen, halleloogy,  
and from this time henceforth and forever  
ther wuz to he nothin but peece. I then  
offered the follerin resoloshen:  
Nesolred, That the Dimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments mad to the constitoo­  
shen doorin and since the late onpleasant­  
nis, and that the recognize and most hart­  
ily acquies in all the results uv the war;  
waad data oanowir  hfraw al ther  
to yooniversal suffrage, but pledge  
therseives to see that our afrskin feller cit­  
izens her not only this, but all other rites  
heretofore enjoyed excloosively by the Cau-  
casnen.  
I put the question ex to tha adopshen uv  
the resoluushen, and it wus carried voonan­  
imusly. It waed hev bin well hed I stop­  
ned here, but I dida&#x27;s. My prevalin week­  
ness is to slop over, and I slopt an this ok­  
kashun fearfully. I called apon the citi  
sens uv the Corners to prove ther faith by  
ther woras. ther ares a see ta a spasm  
uv delite, &quot;present at this meetin twenty  
two uv our feller citizens uv Afrikin de-  
szent.  
Let em step forrerd on this platform  
--let Deckin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker,  
Bascom, Issaker Gavitt, and eighteen other  
  
white citizens, step forrerd, also. Let em  
  
clasp each other by the hand, while I wave  
over em the flag uv our common kentry.  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forrerd, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other by  
thehand, and I wuz about to wave, when  
Joe Bigler riz. He begged me to wait a  
minit, till he hed made his remark. The  
aite afore him moved him almost to teers.  
Ef he hed ever harhored a suspishen that  
ther wuzn&#x27;t anvthing generous in the Ken  
tucky brest, he took it all back. The ack­  
shen uv to-nite wus not only just, but it  
wuz generous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I; &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, the niggers wood be in  
a devilish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided  
on givin em ther rites, uv yoor own akkord,  
for ther ain&#x27;t no power now that kin com­  
pel yoo to do it. I jist got a northern pa­  
per-alas! the Republikin party is split in­  
to fragments--remarkably small fragments.  
Grant assaulted Sumner in the tapitol, last  
Monday; Logan hez hin stoned by the Re­  
publikins uv Filadelfy, on his way home;  
the Central Committees uv Ohio, Injeany  
and Iilinoy hev divided, and each facshen  
hez called a convenshen; and the Noo York  
Trthoon theows on the sponge and a  
As a tr teas istwss asf w Gauasnwe $ wwess  
that nothin under hevin kin prevent the suc­  
cess uv the Dimocratic candidate for the  
Presidency, no matter who he may be, or  
wat platform he is put onto. In view uv  
the disolooshen uv the Republikin party,  
and the fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got  
no perteckters, its really generous that  
yoo--&quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white frends,  
in korious.  
&quot;It hez!&quot; respondid Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;war we&#x27;ve none  
ANd SED DoN&#x27;t count! Take that, roo  
Black cuss!&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin  
fecht the darkey, whose hand he hed hin  
graspin, a most powerful blow atween the  
eves, wich histed him clean off the platform.  
The others follered soot, and in ther zeal  
sprang off the platform after em, and wuz  
a executin war-dances uv the most frantic  
descripshen onto ther prostrate bodies. It  
wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler  
restrained em from takin uv em out and  
hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv coarse, the resolooshen  
wuz rescinded, and others adopted, affirmin  
our adherence to the constooshen ez it yoost  
to be, the iliegality uv the amendments, and  
the nateral seopremacy uv the white enan  
over the d--d nigger, after which we ad  
journed to Bascom&#x27;s, ez iz our custom, and  
ther organized frech raids onto our nateral  
enemies.  
The next mornin I notised a pecoolver  
look on Bigler&#x27;s face, and likewise on Pol­  
leck&#x27;s. Thev grinned at me ez I passed,

Lubbock, the nigger Postmaster, hust into  
a roar ez I walked into his offis, and I angri­  
ly demandid the reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned he,  
laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turninin pale,  
for a suspishun wuz crreepin over me.  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t git no paper at all,  
and-&quot;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in th  
Republikin party North wuz one uv his in­  
fernal lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s ahout de correct state ob de case!&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin all his ivories.  
&quot;Bigler wanted to see ef yoor pentane  
wuz genooine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz oh  
it. He &#x27;sprest a desire to assertane jist  
how peaceable yood he to de nigger and de  
Northern people down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t  
no Publikin party up North to hold yoo;  
dat wuz all.&quot;  
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz oll!&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out  
all that he wanted to. Ur coarse this &quot;out-  
rage.&quot; ez they will call it, will git into the  
Northern papers, and uv coarse Vallandy­  
gum&#x27;s assershun will explude itself without  
hurtin anvhody. Joe. Bigler is my evil  
genius. I shel never be able to run things

the follerin rmlooshen.  
  
1 . Raolved,, That the Dime&amp;lay of  
the Yoonited States irecognize the  
legality uvall the amendments made  
to the - Constitraxilieen&#x27; doorin- &#x27;Mid  
re T it  
since the late onpl th is, and that  
they recognize arid heartily Re- ;  
qulesce in all the, BOIT the war •,  
that they not&#x27;only w thtimw all their  
op when to yoongersel same,  
but pledge thelnielv tq see that our  
Afrikin fellow•citizeug hey not :only  
this but all other rites heretofcre en­  
joyed ezcloosivelyiby the Cancashen.  
I put the question ez to the adop­  
shen uv the resolooshen, and it wuz  
carried yoonanimusly. - It wood hey,:  
I  
.bin well bed I stopped here, but  
didn&#x27;t. - My prevalin weeeknere is to.  
slop Over and I slept on lb is okkasion  
fearfully.. I coiled upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to &#x27;rove their faith  
by their works, &quot;There are,&quot; I said,  
in a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this  
meetin - twenty-two - - uy‘ our fellow  
citizens uv Afrikin descent. Let em  
• p torrent&#x27; on this ; platform-let  
Deekln Pognun, Elder Pennibacker,  
Basccim, Lkstker Gavitt end eighteen  
other Iwhi te citizens step forrerd, also.  
Let them elesP each other by the  
hand While I wave over_em the flag .  
uy our contemn&#x27; kentry.&quot; .  
It • wiz done. The twenty-two  
niggers steppeiVforrerti, the whites  
designated advanced, the two lines  
grasped each other by the hand, and  
I wuz about to wave, when Joe  
Bigler riz. He begged me to wait a  
mlnit till he • bed made his &#x27;retruirk.  
The site afore -Mho moved hint , al­  
most to teets. Ef he hed ever har­  
bored&#x27; a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t  
anything generous in the Kentucky  
breast he took it all back. ,The ack­  
shen int to•nite wuz not only just but  
it wuz generous. .  
&quot;Generous!&quot; said I, &quot;why genet&#x27;:  
mist&quot;! . j .  
  
&quot;Beeps!&#x27; Bed he, &quot;the niggers  
wood be in a devilish bad way of you  
decided on givin ant their  
rites &#x27;  
&#x27; uv your own akkOrd for there  
ain&#x27;t no power now that kin com­  
pel yoo to do it. pat got a: north­  
ern paper—alas! the Republlkin par­  
ty is split into fragments—remarkably  
small fragments. Grant assaulted  
Sumner in the Capitol, last Monday,&#x27;  
Lo *an hex bin stoned by the Repub.  
likinir uv Philattelfy en his way  
home, the central - Comrelttees uv  
Ohio,&#x27; Injeany and •Illlnoy have di-J  
Wiled, and each frackshen hez called ,  
a conyensheh, and the Noo :York  
Taxi= throws lop the sponge and,  
sez that nothin - under evin kin`  
prevent the success uv the Demean  
ic candidate for the Presidency, ri t J,  
matter who he may be or wat platJ  
forini he is put onto. In view uv the  
Vissolooshen uv the Republican par­  
ty, and the fact that the niggers, ain&#x27;t  
now got no perteckters, its redly  
generous that yoo---&quot; •  
The Republikin party is gone to  
pieces t hez it? gasped my twenty­  
two white friends in karious. ,•  
&quot;It hex!&quot; respondid Bigler.  
&quot;Thee,&quot; sed beckin Pogram; his  
eyes dashin in with unwontid fire,  
&quot;what we&#x27;ve done and sed don&#x27;t  
count! Take that, yoo t hhsek cuss!&quot;  
, And with a strength • and activity  
wich , l hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid,  
the Deekin fecht the darkey whose  
hand he&#x27; hed bin graspin, a &#x27;most  
powerful blow atweentbe eyes which  
Mated &#x27;him clean of the platform..  
The others loitered soot, and in their  
zeal Sprang cii the platform after em.  
and wuz a executin war dances uv  
the most frantic descripahen onto  
their, prostrate bodies. It was with  
dlificultrthat Pollock and Bigler re­  
strained ern Irom (akin uv em out  
And hadgin uv em.  
Ilia matter uv course the resalloo­  
sheW wuz rescinded, and others  
adopted affirmin our adherence to the  
constooshen ez it yoost to be, the  
legality uv the amendments, and the  
nateral sooprommitcy uv the white  
roan over the d—d nigger, alter wich  
we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our  
custom, and there organized fresh  
raids onto oar enteral enemies.  
  
The next rimmin I notified a pe­  
coolyeritlook on Bigler&#x27;s face . and  
likewise on Vollock&#x27;s. They grinned

`Afglini&#x27;s cos: &#x27;  
  
Ez the prinsipal objict uv the meetin  
wuz to convins the Republikins• uv the  
&quot;doubtful Mates that the Dotirocrasy tiv  
the South really accepted the situashen;  
and ment, in dod earnest, to recognize  
the great prinsipal uv equality, I  
arranged to hey all the niggers uv the  
Corners present and saved for em the  
best seats in the house. Joe Bigler and  
Pollock cum uv course, which I coodent  
help.  
  
I opened the exorcises. by makin  
short speech oz I took the chair. Ire­  
joist that the time hed finally arrived  
.when the lion an the lamb bed layed  
down together;it — t &#x27; id a child wuz the  
leadin uv ons. &#x27; I knowed that our colored  
fellow.citizens hid.. bin despitefully  
yoosed, and that duo respect had not bin  
alluz paid to our fellow-eitizens uv the  
North, but that time bed now passed,  
and I hoped forever. The Domocrisy  
uv the North; through Vallaudygum,  
bed spoke, they bed accepted the sltua­  
shenr-halloloop;and—fl out this tune  
henceforth and forever there VIUZ nothin  
but peceo. I than offered the following  
resolooshon :  
  
&quot; Beaoised, That the Dimocrisy uv  
the Yoonited States recognize the legal­  
ity, uv all the amendments made to the  
&#x27;Constitooshen dooring and since the  
late onpleasantnis, and&#x27; that they recog­  
nize and most heartily acquiesce• iu all  
the results uv the war ; that they not  
only withdraw all Weir opposishan to  
yoclidversal &#x27;suffrage,&#x27; but pledge their­  
selves., to- see that our Afrikln fellow­  
citizens her not only this; but all other  
rites heictcifore enjoyed. excloosively by  
the Caucashen.&quot;  
  
I put the question ez to.the adopehen  
uv the resolooshen,.and it wuz carried  
yoonanimously. It wood hov bin well  
hed I stopped here, but I didn&#x27;t. 3 , 1 y  
prevalin weekness is to slop over, and I  
slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called  
upon the citizens uv the -.Corners to  
prove their faith by their works. &quot;There  
are,&quot; I said in a spasm of dolite, &quot; presi  
out at this mectin twenty-two um, our?.  
fellow-citizens uvAfrikin descent. Let  
em stop forred on this platform—lot  
Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker,  
Bascom, Issaker Gavitt and eighteen  
other white citizens step forred, also.  
Let them clasp each other by the hand  
while Iwave over em the flag uv our  
common koutry,&quot;  
  
It won done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated  
advanced, the two lines grasped each  
other by the hand, and I was about to  
wave, when Joe, Bigler riz. Ito begged  
me to wait a minit till he had made his  
remark. The site before him almost  
moved him to,ters, Ef ho hed ever  
harbored a suspishen that there wuzu&#x27;t  
anything generous in the .Kentucky  
;breast he took it all back. .The ackshun  
uv to-nito wuz not :only just but it was  
generous.  
  
&quot;Generous !&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, &quot;the Huggers wood  
bo in a doylish bad way of yoo hodn&#x27;t  
decided on given em their rites,ny yoor  
own akkord, for there ain&#x27;t- no power  
now that kin compel yoo to do it. I  
jist.got a northern paper—alasul the Re­  
punkin party is split into fragments—  
remarkably small fragments. Grant as­  
saulted Sumner in the Capital last -Mon­  
&#x27;day, Logan hes bin stoned by the Re­  
publikins . uy Philadelfy bri his way  
home, the Central Committees uv Ohio,  
Injeany and Illinoy hey divided, and  
each frackshen hes called a conyenshun,,  
and the_Noo York Triboon throws up  
the sponge and sez that nothin under  
Kevin kin prevent the_success uv the  
Democratic candidate for the Presidency,  
no matter who lie may be or wilt plat­  
fprin lie is put onto. In view of the  
dissOlooshon uv the Republikin party,  
and the fact that the niggers r now  
got no pertectors, really ncrous  
that yoo , -  
&quot; The Republikin party is gone to

&quot;It hez,&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot;They&quot; said Deck ip Pegram, his

It was done. The 22 niggers stept  
torrid, the whites designated advan­  
ced, the two lines trrasped n»«h other  
by the hand, and I was about to  
waiv, wheh Jo Blgler ria. He beg­  
ged me to wait r, minnit till he had  
made his remark. The site afore  
him almost moved him to tears. Ef  
he had harbored a thought that thur  
wuz&#x27;nt any thing generous in the  
Kentucky breast no took it all back.  
The action nv to nite wuc not only  
just but it waa generous.  
&quot;Generous 1&quot; sed 1, &quot;why gener­

throws up the sponge and sea that  
nothing under hovin kin prevent the

faot that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got

that yoo——&quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party has gone

most powerful blow atween the eyes

in thoir zeal sprung off tho platform  
after em, and wuz n executin war

with difficulty that Pollock and  
Bigler restrained em from takin uv  
em ont and hangiu uv em.  
  
Ez a matter uv course the resolu  
tion wuz rescinded, and others  
adopted afiirmin our adherence to  
the constooshen ez it youst to be,  
the illegality uv the amendments,  
and the natural supremacy uv the  
white man over tho d—d nigger,  
after wich we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s,  
ez is our custom, and there organized  
fresh raids onto our natural enemies.  
  
The next mornin I notised a pe­  
coolyer look on Biglor&#x27;s face, and  
likewise on Pollock&#x27;s. They grinned  
at me ez I passed, with a broadnis  
wioh I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lub­  
bock, the nigger Postmaster, burst  
into a roar ez I walked into bis offis,  
and I angrily demanded the reasAn  
or his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; return­  
ed he, laughing londer than before  
&quot;What mistake I asked turnin  
pale, for a suspicion was creepin  
nver me.  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at  
all, and  
  
And all that story about the split  
  
in the Republican party North, was  
one of hici infernal lies  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de oorreot state ob de  
case!1&#x27; replied the nigger, showing  
all his iv«iries. &quot;Bigler wanted to  
sea if your pentance was genooine—  
dat&#x27;s about all dab wuz OD it. Ho  
&#x27;spresfh desire to assertane jest how  
peuceabla yood be to de nigger and  
de Northern people down heab, ef  
dah wuzn&#x27;t no &#x27;Publican party up  
North to hold you, dat wuz all.&quot;  
  
And the nigger laffed a fiendish  
laff.

“THE NEW DEPARTURE.”  
CoNFEDRIT X ROADS  
(wich is in the State uv Kentucky),  
May 24, 1871,  
A calm and comprehensive survey  
uv the politikle field satisfied me,  
gsome months ago, that without some  
shift in the position uv the democrisy  
our hope uv success wuz exceedingly  
thin. The resolooshens interdoost by  
Vallandygum into the Convensum uv  
the democrisy uv Montgomery county,  
Ohio, wuz to me a newlite. Troo,  
they hev the slite disadvantage uv ab­  
joorin everything that is democratic,  
and uv putting the democratic party on  
purely repubiican ground, but wat uv  
that? I kin stand even so sudden a  
change ez that. Wat I want is the soo­  
preme happiness uv kickin that nigger  
Lubbock out uv the postoflis at the Cor­  
ners, and uv putting myself in his  
place, and Kernel McPetter and Elder  
Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin  
outside the offices uv Assessor and Col­  
lector are actooatid by the same high  
and holy impulses, If to do this re­  
quires the okkepying uv republikin  
ground, the war cry uv us three is “ok­  
kepy.” Kentucky issure to go demo­  
cratic anvhow, and if we kin by so  
simple a process ez passin resolooshens  
indoose enufl’ dissatisfied republikins  
in the close Northern States to vote  
with us these boons, we three are for  
passin these resolooshens, no matler  
wat they are. ‘This bein my under­  
standin uv Vallandygum’s movement,  
I actid onto it to wunst,  
I got the leadin dimocracy uv the  
Corners together one nite at Bascom’s.  
That I mite get em all at one time, I  
waited till the regular evenin for the  
raid on the niggers and Northern set­  
tlersup toards Garrettstown, knowing  
that on their return the’d all stop at  
Bascom’s for a drink, and that es they’&#x27;d  
bin successful in their hanging and  
burnin they&#x27;d be in good humor and  
ready to adopt anything I shood sug­  
gest. It wuz a very short but a very  
satisfactory consultashen. There.wuz  
some objeckshuns on the part uv a few  
to what they called an abandonment uv  
dimocratic idees, but Bascom settled  
their hash in very short mewe. He  
remarked that it waz necessary that the  
offises be in the hands uv his friends  
for obvious reasons. He wantid pay  
and he knowd uv no other way to get  
it. He bleeved in the fullest freedom  
of thought and ackshen, and that every&#x27;  
one shood express hisself untrameled,  
but he coodent abide a idiot. If there  
wuz any one in that assemblage soi  
stoopid ez to differ with him on this&#x27;  
question, let him make hisself known.  
No sich man shood ever git a drop at  
his bar, never ; sich a one wuz not de­  
servin uv even the commonest neses­  
aries of life. Several who had riz to  
their feet to object, dropt ez though!  
they had been shot. j  
1t wuz determined to hold a public  
meetin the next nite at the church to  
make a public endorsement uv Valland­  
ygum’s idea.  
Ez the prinsiple objick of the meetin  
wuz to counvins the republikins uv the  
doubtful States that the democrisy of  
the South really acceptid the situashen,  
and meant, in dead earnest, to recog­  
nize the great prinsiple uv equality, I  
arranged to hev all the niggers uv the  
Corners present, and saved for em the  
best seats in the house. Joe Bigler  
and Pollock come, uv course, wich I  
coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by making a  
short speech ez I took the chair. I re­  
joist that the time had fivally arriv  
when the lion and the lamb hed layed  
down together and a small child wuz a  
leadin uv em. I knowd that our col­  
ored fellow citizens hed bin despiteful­  
ly yoosed, and that doo respeck hed  
not bin alluz paid to our fellow citizens  
uv the North, but that time had now  
passed and I hoped forever. The  
democrisy uv the North, through Val-,  
landygum, hed spoke ; they hed accep-&#x27;  
tld the situashen, halleloogy, and from  
this time henceforth and foreover there  
wuz nothin but peece. I then offered  
the following resolooshen :— |  
Resolved,ql‘hat the dimocrisy of the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality !  
uv all the amendments made to the  
constitooshen doorin and since the late  
onpleasantnis, and that they recognize  
and most heartily acquiesce in all the|  
results uv the war; that they not only |  
withdraw all their opposishen to yoo-|  
niversal suffrage, but p]ed%e theirselves |  
to see that our Afrikin fellow citizens,  
bev not only this but all other rites |  
heretofore enjoyed *excloosively by the |  
Caucashen. 3  
1 Eut the question ez to the adopshen  
uv the resolooshen, and it was carried  
yoonanimusly. It wood hey bin well  
bed I stopped here, but I didnt. My  
¥revailin weekness is to slop over and  
slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I  
called npon the citizens uv the corners |  
to prove their faith by their works.  
“There are,” I said in a spasm of delite,  
“present at this meetin twenty-two uv  
our fellow citizens uv Afrikin descent.  
Let them step forrerd on this platform—  
let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker,  
Bascom, Issaker Gavitt and eighteen  
other white citizens step forrerd also.  
Let the clasp each other by the hand  
while I wave over em the flag uv our  
common kentry.”  
It wuz done. The twenty-two nig-]  
gers stepped torrerd, the whites des­  
ignated advanced, the twol&#x27;nes grasped |  
each other by the hand, and 1 wuz about  
to wave, when Joe Bigler riz. He}  
begged me to wait 8 minit till he bed  
muﬁa his remark. The site afore him  
moved him almost to teers. Efhe bad  
ever harbored a suspishen that there  
wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Ken­  
  
tucky breast he took it all back. The  
ackshen uv to-nite wuz not only just,  
but it wuz generous.  
“Generous!” said I. “Why gener­  
ous?&quot;” ¢  
“Becoz,” sed he, ‘‘the niggers wood  
be in a devilish bad way es yoo hedn’  
decided on given em their rites uv yoor  
own akkord, for there ain’t no power  
now that kin compel yoo to doo it. I  
jist got a Northern paper—alas! the re­  
publikin ;l)arty is split into fragments—  
remarkably small fragments. Grant  
assaulted Summer in the capitol last  
Monday. Logan hez bin stoned by the  
republicans uv Philadelfy on his way  
home, the Central Committees uv Ohio,  
Injeany and Illinoy hev divided, and  
each frackshen hez called a convenshen,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up  
the sponge, and says that nothin under  
hevin kin prevent the success uv the  
democratic candidate for the Presi­  
dency, no matter who he may be or wat  
platform he is put onto. Inview of the  
dissolooshen uv the republikin party,  
and the fact that the niggers ain’t now  
got no perteckters, its really generous  
that yoo——&quot;  
“The republikin party is gone to  
pieces! hez it?” gasped my twenty-two  
white friends in korus.  
It hez &quot; responded Bigler.  
“Then,” sed Deekin Program, his  
eyes flashin with unwonted fire, *What  
we&#x27;ve done and sed don’t count! Take  
that, you black cuss !”  
And with a strength and activity wich  
I hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, the  
Deekin fecht the darkey whose hand he  
hed bin graspin a most powerful. blow  
atween the eyes, wich histed him clean  
off the platform. The others followed  
soot in their zeal,sprang off the platform  
after em, and wuz a executin war  
dances uv the most frantic descripshen  
onto their prostrate bodies. It wuz  
with difficulty that Pollock aand Bigler  
restrained em from takin uv em out and  
hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resolooshen  
{ wuz rescinded, and others adopted af­  
| firmio our adherence to the constooshen  
{ez it yoost to be, the illegality uv the  
&#x27; amendments, and the nateral sooprem­  
&#x27;acy uv the white man over the d—d  
nigger, after which we adjourned to  
{Buscom’s ez is our custom, and there  
organized fresh raids into our nateral  
. enemies.  
. The next morning I notised a pe­  
| coolyer look on Bigler’s face, and like­  
wise on Pollock’s. They grinned at  
me ez I passed with a broadnis wich I  
couldn’t acecount for. Lubbock, the  
nigger postmaster, burst into a roar ez  
}I walked into bis offis, and I angrily  
| demanded the reason for his hilarity.  
i “Dat mistake ob Bigler’s” returned  
&#x27; he, laughing louder than before.  
| “What mistake?” 1 asked, turnin  
pale, for suspishun wuz creepin over me,  
~ ““Why, he didn’t get no paperat all,  
‘and—&quot;  
~ ¢“And all that story about the split in  
the repablikin party North wuz one uv  
his infernal lies !”  
. “Dat’s about de correct state ob de  
‘case ! replied the nigger showin all  
his ivories.— “Bigler wanted to see es  
| yoor pentance wuz genooine — dat’s  
‘about dah wuz ob it. He ’spresta de­  
sire to ascertain jist how peeceable yood |  
be to de nigger and de Northern people 1  
down heah, es dah wuzn’t no ’publikin  
party up North to hold yoo; dat wuzall.”  
And the nigger laffed a feendish lass.  
«Dat wuz all!” he repeated.  
¥t wuz enuff. I gnessthe cuss fonnd  
out all that he wanted to. Uv course  
this ‘‘outrage,” cz they call it, will get  
into the Northern papers, and uv course  
Vallandygum’s assershun will explode  
itself without hurtin anybody. Joe  
Bigler ismy evil genius. Ishel never  
be able to run things ez I want to so  
long ez he lives. |

teen other white citizens step forrerd, also.  
Let them clasp each other by the hand  
while I wave over em the flag uv our com­  
mon kontry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I was about to wave,  
when Joe. Bigler riz. He begged me to  
wait a minit till he had made his remark.  
The site before him almost moved him to  
teers. Ef he hed ever harbored a suspishen  
that there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the  
Kentucky breast he took it all back. The  
ackshun uv to-nite wuz not only just but  
it was generous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, &quot;the niggers wood be  
in a devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided  
on given em their rites, uv yoor own ak­  
kord, for there ain&#x27;t no power now that kin  
compel yoo to do it. I jist got a northern  
  
paper--alas! the Republikin party is split  
ito tiragments-remarhatbly small frag  
ments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the  
Capital last Monday, Logan hes bin stoned  
by the Republikins uv Philadelfy on his  
way home, the Central Committees uy  
Ohio, Injeany and Illinoy hev divided, and  
each frackshen hes called a convenshun,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under hevin kin  
prevent the success uv the Democratic can  
didate for the Presidency, no matter who  
he may be or wat platform he is put onto.  
In view of the dissolooshen uv the Re-  
publikin party, and the fact that the nig­  
gers ain&#x27;t now got no pertectors, its really  
generous that yoo--&quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces  
hez it,&quot; gasped my twenty-two white  
friends in korious.  
&quot;It hez,&quot; responded Bioler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; said Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that you  
black cuss.&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich  
I hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Dee­  
kin fecht the darkey whos hand he hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which histed him clean off the plat-  
form. The others follered suit, and in their  
zeal sprang off the platform after em, and  
waz a executin war dances uv the most  
frantic descripshen unto their prostrate  
bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock  
and Bigler restrained em from takin uv em  
out and hanging uv em.  
Ez matter uv course the resolooshen wuz  
recinded, and others adopted affirmin our  
adherence to the Constitushun ez it yoost  
to be, the illegality uv the amendments, and  
the natural soopremacy uv the white man  
over thed-d nigger, after which we  
adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom,  
and there organized fresh raids onto our  
nateral enemies.  
The next mornin&#x27; I notised a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler&#x27;s facde, likewise on Pollock&#x27;s.  
They grinned at me as I passed, with a  
oroadhls that I couadn&#x27;t account for. Lub­  
bock, the nigger postmaster, bust into a  
roor ez I walked into his offis, and I an­  
grily demanded the reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned he,  
laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turnin pale,  
for a suspishen wuz creepin over me.  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paperat all, and  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the  
Republikin party North wuz one uv his in  
fernal hies!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case!&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin all his ivories.  
&quot;Bigler wanted to see ef yoor pentance  
wuz genooine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob

ConFEDmIT N Roads, I  
twich is in the State of Kentucky  
May21, 187l. I  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv  
the politikle field satisfied me, some  
months ago, that without some shift in  
the position of the dimocrisy, our hope uv  
sncetss was excccdinly thin. The ress  
interdoost by Vallandygum into  
the convenshun of the dimocrisy fiv Mont  
gomery county, Ohio, wur to ine a new  
life. Troo, they hav the slite disadvantage  
  
uy abjoorin&#x27; everything that is dimocritic,  
and uv putting the dimocralic party on  
puirely repiblican ground, but wat ny  
that? I kin stand even so sudden a  
shange er that. Wal l want is the soo  
happiness uv kickin that nigger,  
Lubback, out ny the post offis at the Cor  
ners, and uv putting myself in his place,  
and Kernel MePelter and Elder Pennis  
backer, who hev hin languishin&#x27; outside  
the offices uy assessor and collector, are  
tnaled by the same hich and laly ine  
uf to do this repires the ofepr  
ny republikan ground, the war cry tiv  
is three is, &quot;Okepy. Kentucky is sure  
togo dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin,  
ty so sinpie a procsss as pasin resilon  
indoose enul dissatisled republis  
liting in the close northern States to sote  
with us to elect a dimocratic president  
who will give us these boons, we three are  
for passin&#x27; these resolooshens, no matter  
wat they are. This bein iny underai  
fiv Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I  
actid onto it to wunst.  
I got the leadin dimocrisy uv the Cor  
ners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That  
I mite get em all at one time, I waited  
till the regular evenin for the raid on the  
niggers and northern settlers up toards  
Garrettstown, knowing that on their re  
they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a  
  
lrink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in  
their hangin and burnin, they&#x27;d be ingood  
humor and ready to adopt anything I  
shood suggest. It wuz a very short but a  
very satishctory consultashen. There  
wuz some objeckshuns on the part uv a  
lew to what they called an abandonment  
of dimocratic idees, but Bascom settled  
their hash in very short metor. lle reae  
that it wuz necessary that the  
offises be in the hands uv his lriends for  
obvious reasons. He wanted pay, and he  
knowed uv no other way to get it. He  
believed in the fullest freedom of thought  
and achshen, and that every one shood  
cxpress hisself untrameled, bit he condent  
abide a idiot. If there wuz any one in  
that assemblage so stoopid ez to differ  
with him on this question, let him make  
hisself known. For sich a man shood  
naver git a drop at his bar, never; sich a  
ome was nol descrvin ny cven the come  
necessaries uv life. Several who  
had riz to their feet to object, dropt as  
though they had been shot,  
it wuz determined to hold a public  
the next nite at the church to  
  
mnake a public endorsement of Vallandy  
gimn&#x27;s ide.  
Ey the principal object uy the meetin  
wus to convins the republicans uv the  
loaibtful states that the dimocrisy uv the  
South really acceptid the situashen, and  
meant, in dead earnest, to recognize the  
great principle uv equality, I arranged to  
hey all the niggers ty the Corners pres.  
nt, and saved for them the best seats in  
the hotise, Jos lligler and Pollock come,  
of course, wich I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by making a  
short apeech ef I took the chair. I fes  
olst that the time had finally arrly when  
the lion and the lamb hed layed down to  
gether, and a small child was leadin uv  
a. Tkuowd that our colored lellow  
itizens had been dispitefully yoosed, and  
that the respeck had not bin alluz pald to  
our fellow-eltizens uy the North, but that  
time hed now passed and I hoped forever  
The democrisy uv the North, through  
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they had ac  
cepted the situation, halleloogy, and from  
this time henceforth and forever there wus  
to be nothin&#x27; but peece. I then offered  
the following resolution.  
&quot;Hesolerd, That the demnocrisy of the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the consti  
tooshen doorin and since the late unpleas  
antnis, and that they recognize and most  
heartily acquiesce in all the results uv the  
war, that theyinot only withdraw all their  
  
opposishen to yoonlversal suffrage, but  
pledge theirselves to see that our Alrikin  
fellow citizens hey not only this, but all  
other rites heretofore excloosively en  
joved by the Cattcashen.&quot;  
I put the question ez to the adopshen  
uy the resolooshen, and it was carried  
yoonanimously. It wood hey hin well  
hed I stopped there, but I didn&#x27;t. My  
prevalling weakness is to sip over, and  
slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called  
upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove  
their falth by their works. &quot;There are,I  
said in a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this  
meeting twenty-two uv our fellow citizens  
of Afrikin descent. Let em step forred  
on this platform--let Deckin Pogram,  
Thlor Feanibacker, llascom, lsaher ta  
and eighteen other white citizens  
step forred also. Let them clasp each  
other by the hand while I wave over en  
the flag uv our common kentry.&quot;  
it wis done. The twenty-wo niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated, ad  
  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
 the hand, and I wat about to wave  
when loe ligler riz. He begged me to  
wait a minit till he hed made his remarle  
The site afore him moved him almost to  
teers. Ef he hed ever hatbored a suis  
pishen that there wasn&#x27;t anything gener  
inis in the kentucky breast he tor it all  
back. The ackshen uv to nite wuz not  
only just, but it wuz generous.  
&quot;Generous, said I, &quot;Why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz, said he, &quot;the niggers wood  
be in a devilish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t  
decided on given them their rites uv yoor  
own akkord, for there ain&#x27;t no power now  
that can compel yoo to do it. I jist got a  
northern paper--alas! the republikin par-­  
ty is split into fragments-remarkably  
siall fragments. Grant assaulted Sum  
her in the capital last Monday, Logan has  
hin stoned by the republikins of Phila  
lelfy on his way home, the central com-  
  
mnitice of Ohio, injeany and illinoy have  
divided, and each frackshen hez called a  
convenshen, and the New York Jritoon  
throws up the sponge, and says that  
msthin muder hevin Ain prevent the suce  
uv the democratic candidate for the  
presidency, no matter who he may be or  
wat platlorm he is put onto. In view uv  
the dissolooshen of the republican party,  
and the lact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now  
got no perteckters, its really generous that  
o  
&quot;The republikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenly-two white  
Iriends in korious.  
It hey responded ligler.  
&quot;Then, said Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;What we&#x27;ve  
done and said don&#x27;t count! Take that,  
you black cuss!&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich  
hedw t lcokd for in one so arid the Bee  
fecht the darkey whose hand he had  
been graspin a most powerful blow  
atween the eyes, which hisled him clean  
off the platform. The others follored  
tut, and in their zeal sprang off the plat  
form alter em, and waz a executin war  
dances av the most irantic description on  
to their prostrate bodies. It wuz with  
difficulty that Pollock and ligler fe  
strained em from taking uv em out and  
hangin uv em.  
E? a matter of course the resolooshen  
wllz rescined, and others adopted affir  
min our adherence to the constooshen ez  
yeost to he the llegality nv the amende  
and the nateral soopremacy uv the  
  
white man over the d--d nigger, after  
which we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s ez is omr  
custom, and there organized fresh raids  
into our nateral enemies.  
The next morning I notised a pecoolyer  
tat on itgis a tiae and lhcwise on Ile  
eks. They grinned at me, ez I passed  
with a droadnls wich I couldn&#x27;t account  
for. Lubbock, the nlgger postmaster,  
buist into a roar, ez I walked into his effis,  
and I angrily demanded the reason for  
his hilarity,  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s&quot; returned he,  
laughing louder than before.  
he  
  
What mistake. I asked, turming  
for suspishun wuz creepin over me.  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all  
and  
&quot;And all that story about the split in  
the Republikin party north wuz one uv  
his internal lies?&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about the correct state ob de  
case!&quot; replied the nigger, showing all his  
ivories. &quot;Bigler wanted to see ef yoor  
pentance wuz genooine--dat&#x27;s about all  
dar wuz ob it. He &quot;sprest a desire to as  
sertane jist how peaceable yood be to de  
nigger and de northern people down heah,  
el dar wuzn&#x27;t no publikin party up north  
to hold you, dat wug all.&quot;  
And the nigger laffed a flendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
  
It was enufl. I guess the cuss found  
out all that he wanted to. Uv course  
this &quot;outrage, ez they will call it, will get  
into the northern papers, and uv course

Xasby on the Mew Departure.  
[From the Toledo Blade ]  
Confedrit X Roads,  
(wieh iz in the State of Kentucky.)  
May 24, 1871.  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv the  
Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedinly  
thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Yallandyghatn  
into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisy  
uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a  
new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage  
uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and  
uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin  
ground, but wat uv that ? I kin stand  
! even so sudden a change ez that! Wat 1 want  
iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger  
Lubbock out uv the postofiis at the Corners,  
and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel  
McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bio  
languishiu outside the offices uv assessor and  
collector are actooatid by the same high and  
holy impulses. Ef to Jo this requires the  
okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry  
uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so  
simple a process ez nassin resolooshens iudoose  
enuff dissatisfied Uepublikins in the close  
Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic  
President who will give us these boons,  
we three are for passin these resolooshens no  
matter what they are. This bein my uuderstandin  
uv \ allandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid  
onto it to wunst.  
1 fi-ot the leedin D mncriav uv fKo I V.rrw?ru  
  
together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That 1 mite  
get em all at ooe time, I waited till the regler  
evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern  
settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that  
on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for  
a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in  
their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good  
humor and ready to adopt anything I shood  
suggest. It vruz a very short but a very satisfactry  
oonsultashen. There wuz some objiekshuns  
on the part uv a few to wat tbey called  
an abandonment uv Dimoeratic idees, but Bas  
com settled their hash in very short metre.  
He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the  
offises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius  
reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv  
no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the  
fullest freedom uv thought and ackshen, and  
that every one shood express hisself untrarameled,  
but he coodent abide a idiot. If there  
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez  
to differ with him on that question, let him  
make hisself known. No sick man shood ever  
git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz  
not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries  
uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to  
  
object dropt ez though they hed bio shot.  
It wuz determined to bold a public meetin  
the next nite at the church to make a public  
endorsement uv Yallandygum&#x27;s idees.  
Ez the prinsipal objict uv the meetin wuz to  
convins the Republikios uv the doubtful States  
that the Diinocrisy uv the South really accepted  
the situashun, and meat, in ded ernest, to recognise  
the great priosiple uv equality, I arranged  
to hev all the niggers u v the Corners present,  
and saved for thcra the best seats in the house.  
Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I  
ooodont help.  
I opened the exercises by making a short  
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the  
time hed finally arriv when the lion and the  
lamb hed laid down together, and a small child  
wuz leading uv em. 1 knowed thet our colored  
fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yooaed,  
and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid  
to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that  
time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The  
Dimucrisy uv the North, Vrallandygum, hed  
spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy,  
and from this time henceforth and forever  
there wuz to be notbin but peece. i then  
offered the follerm resoloosheu :  
&quot;Resolved, That the Diinocrisy uv the Yoouited  
States recognize the legality uv all the  
amendments made to the Constituoshen dooring  
and since the late onpleaBantnis, and that they  
recognise aud most heartily acquiesce in all the  
results uv the war ; that they not ouly withdraw  
all their opposisben to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our  
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but  
all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively  
by the Caucashen.&quot;  
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the  
reaolooshen, aud it wuz carried yoonanimusly.  
It wood hev bin well hed I stopped here, but I  
didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekuess is to slop over,  
and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called  
upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their  
faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; 1 said, in  
a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this meetin  
twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin  
descent. Let em step forrerd on this platform  
P lmj?i&gt; :i?i? u -  
  
?ici i/ccaiu a g^raui, liiun i cuuiuftuher, i&gt;iis  
com, Issaker Guvitt, and eighteen other white  
citizens step forrerd also. Let them clasp  
each other by the hand while 1 wave over em  
the flag uv our common kontry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two uiggers stepped  
forrerd, the whites designated advanced,  
the two lines grasped each other by the hand,  
and I wuz about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize.  
Ho begged me to wait a minnit till he hed made  
hia remark. The site afore him moved him almost  
to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen  
that there wuzu&#x27;t anything generous in  
the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The  
acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz  
generons.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a  
devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given  
them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for there  
ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do  
it I jist got a Northern paper?alas! the Kepublikin  
party is split into fragments?remarkably  
small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner  
in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by  
the Kepublikins uv Philadelfy on hiz way  
home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany,  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz  
called a convenshen, and the Noo York  
Triboon throws up the sponge and sez that  
notbin under the hevin Wo prevent the success  
uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency,  
no matter who he may be or wat platform be is  
put onto. In view uv the dissoloosben uv the  
Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers  
ain&#x27;t now got no perteckters, its really generous  
that yoo &quot;  
&quot; The Kepublikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends  
in korions.  
&quot; It hez 1&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot; Then,&quot; said Deo kin Pogr&amp;ui, his eyes flashin  
with unwonted fire, &quot; what we&#x27;ve dene and  
and don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss ?&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deck in  
fecht the darkey whose hand he bed bin graspin,  
a most powerful blow atweea the eyes which  
histed him clean off the plutform, the others  
followered soot, and in their zeal sprang off the  
  
platform after em, aad wax a executia war  
dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto  
their proatrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty  
that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from  
takin uv em out and hanging uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the reaalooshen wuz  
reminded, and others adopted affirmin our ad&#x27;  
bereoce to the constitoosbatf ez it yoost to bo,  
the illegality uv the amendments, and the  
natural soopremacy uv the white man over the  
1 d?4 nigger, after wich we adjourned to Basoom&#x27;s,  
ex is our custom, and there organized  
frfih raids onto our nateral enemies  
The next morning 1 notised a pecoolyer look  
&#x27; oa Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s,  
frinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis  
wich I oauldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the  
1 postmaster, bust into a roar ez 1 walked  
4nto bis offis, and I angrily demanded the rea­  
son for has hilarity.  
*&#x27; LhSl mistake ob Biglers,&#x27;* returned be,  
laughHbg loader than before.  
&quot; What mistake?&quot; 1 asked, turning pale, fo:  
a suspishen was creepin over me.  
44 Whv, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and?&#x27;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the  
Republikiu party North wuz one uv his infer  
nalliee!&quot;  
44 Bat&#x27;s about de oorreet state ob de cess 1&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin all his ivories.  
M Bigler wanted to see ef yoor &#x27;pentance wui

*sprest a desire to assertane jist how peeceabU

Nasby and his friends Second the  
  
Movement of Vallandigham.  
  
CoNFeDeRIt x Roads, May 24th, 1871.  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the  
polticle field, satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv the  
Dimocrisy, our hope of success was exceed  
ingly thin. The resolooshuns interdoost by  
Vallandygum into the Convenshun uv the  
Dimocrisy of Montgomery county, Ohis, was  
to me a new life. Troo, they hev the slite  
disadvantage uv abjoorin everything that is  
and uv puttin the Dimocratic I  
party on purely Republikin ground, but wati  
uv that? I kin stand even so sudden changes,  
ez that. Wat I want iz the soopreme happi­  
ness uv kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv  
the postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin my  
self in his place, and Kerne? McPelter and  
Elder Pennybacker, who have been languish-,  
in outside the offises uv Assessor and Sollector  
actooatid by the same high and holy im­  
pulses. Ef to do this requires the okkvpying  
uv Republikin ground, the war cry, uv us thre

that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s  
for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful  
in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good­  
humor and ready to adopt anything I shood  
suggest. It was a very short but a very satis. f

Boscom settled their hash in very short me&#x27;ter.  
He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the

knowd uv no other way to git it. He beleeved  
in the fullest freedom uv thought and ackshen,  
and that every one should expresse hisself  
free and untrameled, but he coodent abide a  
idiot. Ef there wuz any one in that assem-

Ir wus determined to hold a public  
meetin the next nite at the church to  
be a publin endorsement uw wallandy­  
gum&#x27;s idees.  
the prinsiple, objick ny the meetin  
wuz to convins the Republikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrats uv  
the South really acceptid the situashen,  
and meant, in dead earnest, to recognize  
the great prinsiple uv equality, I arrang.­  
d to hey all the niggers av the Corners  
present, and saved for em the best seats  
in the house. Joe Bigler and Pollock  
come, uv course, wich I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by makin a short  
peech ez I took the chair. I rejois that  
he time hed finally arriv when the lion  
and the lamb hed layed down together  
ad a small child wuz a loadin uv em. I  
knowd that our colored fellow-citizens  
hed bin dispitefully yoosed, and that doo  
respeck hed not allus bin paid to our iel  
the North, but that time  
hed now passed and I hoped forever.  
The Dimocrisy uv the North, through  
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they hed ac  
cepted the situashen, halleloogy, and  
from this time henceforth and forever  
there wuz to be nothin but peace. I  
then offered the followin resolooshen:  
Resolved, That the Dimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality  
uv all the amendments made to the Cone  
stitooshen doormn and since the late  
onpleasnis, and that they recognize and  
most heartily acquiesce in all the results  
uv the war; that they withdraw all then  
opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, but  
pledge theirselves to see that our Afriken  
fellow-citizens hey not only this but all  
other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosive­  
ly by the Cancashen.  
I put the question oz to the adopshen  
 uv the resolooshen, and it wuz carried.  
yoonanimously. It would hev bin well  
hed I stopt here, but I didn&#x27;t. My pre­  
vailin weekness iz to slop over, and I  
slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called  
upon the citizens av the Corners to  
prove their works. &#x27;There is,&#x27; I said, in  
a spasm uv delite, &#x27;resent at this meetin  
twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens uv  
Afrikin descent. Let em step forrerd on  
this platform--let Deekin Pogram, Elder  
Pennibacker, Bascom, Isaaker Gavitt,  
and eighteen other white citizens step  
forrerd, also. Let em clasp each other  
by the hand while I wave over em the  
uv our common kentry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stept forrerd, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and wuz about to wave,  
when Joe Bigler riz. He begged me to  
wait a minit till he hed made his remark.  
The site afore him moved him almost to  
teers. Ef he hed ever harbored a sus­  
pishen that there wuzn&#x27;t anything gener­  
ous in the Kentucky breast he took it all  
back. The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not  
only just but it wuz generous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; said I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t de­  
cided on givin em their rites uv  
yoor own akkord, for there ain&#x27;t no  
power now that kin compel you to do it  
jist got a Northern paper--alas! the  
Republikin party iz split into fragments  
remarkably small fragments. Grant  
assaulted. Sumner in the Capitol last  
Monday. Logan hez hin stoned by the  
Republikins uv Philadelfy on his way  
home, the Central Committees uv Ohio,  
Injeany Illinoy hev divided, and each  
trackshen hez called a convenshun,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up  
the sponge and sez that nothin under  
hevin kin prevent the success uv the  
Dimocratic candidate for the Presidency,  
no matter who he may be or wat plat­  
form he is put onto. In view uv the  
dissolooshen av the Republikin party,  
and the fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now  
got no perteckters, its really generous  
that yoo--&quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party iz gone to  
pieces! hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two  
black friends in korious.  
&quot;It hez!&#x27; respondid Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&#x27; said Deekin P&#x27;ogram, his eyes  
dashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that,  
yoo black cuss!&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich  
I hedn&#x27;t lookt for one so agid, the Deekin  
etcht the darky whose hand he hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow at ween  
the eyes wich histed him clean off the  
blatform. The others follered soot, and

THE NASBY LETTERS.  
Mr. Warty and Hi* Trtandi t«eond tta  
■oTsment of VaUandUham-A *eatln«  
in which Hr. Joseph Bigler Takes a Part.  
[From the Toledo Blade.)  
( osrrDiilT X Roads. )  
(with U In tbo siete of Kentucky&#x27;, &gt;■  
May M, 18TI. 1  
A cahn and comprehensive survey  
uv the iM&#x27;litikle field satisfied me, some  
months ago, that without some shift  
in the position uv the Dimocricy, our  
hope uv success was exceedingly thin.  
The resolooshens introdoost by V al­  
laudyghum into the couvenshun uv  
the Dimoerisy of Montgomery county,  
Ohio, wuz to me a new lite. Troo,  
they hev the slite disadvantage uv ad­  
joorin everything that is Dimocratic,  
and uv putting the Dimocratic party  
on purely Republikiu ground, but wat  
of that? I kin stand even so sudden  
a change ez that. Wat I want is the  
soopereme happiness of kickin that  
nigger Lubbock out uv the postoffls  
at the Corners, and uv puttin myself  
in his place, and Kernel McPelter and  
Elder Pennihacker who hev bin lan­  
guishing outside the offices uv assessor  
and collector are iictooated by the  
samo high and holy impulses, tf to  
do this requires the okkepyin uv Re­  
publican ground the war cry uv us  
three is “okkepy.” Kentucky is shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we  
lrin hv iiimtilp Ul’OCPSS ez IKUSin FfiSO*  
  
looslieus iiulno.se enuff dissatisfied Ite­  
publikctis in tlie close Northern States  
to vote with us to elect a Dnnoeratio  
President who will give us these  
boons, wo three are for passin these  
rcsolooshcns, no matter wat they are.  
This liein my understanding uv Val­  
laiidigham&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it  
to wunst  
I got the leedin Democracy uv the  
Corners together one niteat Da scorn’s.  
That I mite get em all at one time, I  
waited till the regler even in for the  
raid on tlie niggers and Northern set­  
tlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin  
that, on their return, they’d all stop at  
Bascom’s for a drink, and that, if  
they’d been successful in their hang­  
ing and burnin, they&#x27;d be in good hu­  
mor and ready to adopt anything I  
sliood suggest. It wuz a very short  
but a very satisfactory consultashen.  
There wus some objvcksliuus on the  
part uv a few to wat they called an  
abandonment uv Democratic ideas,  
but Bascou settled their hash in very  
short meter. He remarkt that it wus  
necessary that the otlises be in the  
hands uv his friends for obvius rea­  
sons. He wanted pay and he kuowed  
uv no other way to git it. He lieleeved  
in the fullest freedom uv thought and  
aekshen, and that every one sliood ex­  
press hisself untrameled, but lie cood­  
ent abide a idiot. If there wuz any  
one in that assemblage so stoopped as  
to differ with him on this question,  
let him make hisself known. No sich  
man sliood ever get a drop at his bar.  
never; sich a one wuz not dcserviii uv  
even the commonest necessaries uv  
life. tSevenil who had riz to their feet  
to object, dropt ez though they lied  
been shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public  
meetin the li.-xt liite at the church to  
make a public indorsement uv Yallan­  
dygum&#x27;s idea.  
£z the principle object of the meetin  
wuz to convinsthe Republikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv  
tlie South really acceptid the situashen  
and meant in dead earnest to recog­  
nize tlie great prinsiple uv equality, I  
arranged to hev all the niggers uv the  
Comers present, and saved for em the  
best seats in the house. Joe Bigler  
aud Pollock came, uv course, which 1  
coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by making n  
short speech ez I took the chair. 1 re­  
joist that the time had finally arrived  
when the lion and the lamb hed layed  
down together and a small child was a  
leadin uv em. I knowd that our col­  
ored fellow&#x27; citizens hed bin despitefut­  
ly yoosed, and that doo respeck bed  
not bin aliuz paid to our fellow citi­  
zens uv the North, hut that time hed  
now passed and I hoped forever. The  
Dimocrisy uv the North, through Val­  
landygum, lied spoke, they hed accept­  
ed the situashen, hallelogy, and from  
this time henceforth and forever there  
wuz to he nothing but peace:  
ltcsolred, That the Dimocrisy of the  
Yoonited States recognize tlie legality  
uv all the amendments made to the  
constitooshen doorin and since the  
late oupleasants, and that they recog­  
nize and most heartily acquiesce in all  
the results of the war; that they not  
only withdraw all their opposishen to  
yooniversal suffrage, but pledge their­  
selves to see that our Afrikin fellow  
citizens hev not only this but all other  
rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively  
by the C’aucashen.  
I put tlie question ez to tlie adop­  
slien uv the resolooslien, and it wuz  
carried yoonanimusly. It wood av  
bin well had I stopped here, hut I  
didn’t. My prevailin’ weakness is to  
slop over, and I slopt on this okkasion  
fearfuily. I called upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to pro\e their faith by  
their works. ‘’There are,” I said, in  
a spasm of delite,” “ present at this  
meetin 22 uv our fellow citizens of  
Afrikin descent. Let em step forred  
on this platform—let Dekin Pogram,  
Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Isaker  
Gavit, and 18 other white citizens  
step forred also. Let them clasp each  
other by the hand, while I wave over  
em the flag of our common kuntry.” j  
It was done. The 22 niggers step­  
ped forred, the whites designated ad­  
vance, the two lines graped each other  
by the hand, and I was about to  
wave, when Joe Bigler riz. He beg­  
ged me to wait a minit till be hed made  
fi is remark. The site afore him moved  
  
nun auuusi iu m iw ucu imr­  
bored a suspishin that there wuz’t  
anything generous in the Kentucky  
breast lie took it all back. The action  
uv to nite wuz not only just but it  
wuz generous.  
“Generous!” said I, “why gener­  
ous?”  
“ Becoz,” sed he, “ the niggers wood  
be in a develish bad way ef you hedn’t  
decided on givin em their rites, uv  
yoor own akkord, for there ain’t no  
power now that kin compel yoo to do  
it. I jlst got a Northern paper—alas  
the Republikin party is,split into frag­  
ments—remarkably small fragments.  
Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol,  
last Monday, Logan hez been stoned  
by the Republikms of Phi la deify on  
his way home, the Central Commit­  
tees uv Ohio, Injeany and Illinoy.liev  
divided, and each frackshen hez called  
a Convenshen, and the Noo York Tri­  
boon throws up the sponge and sez that

he or wat platform he is put onto. In  
view of the dissoloosheu uv the Re­  
publikin party, and the fact that the  
niggers ain’t now got no perteckters,  
its really generous that yoo-”  
“ The Republikin party is gone to  
pieces, hez it?” grasped my 21 white  
friends in korions.  
“ It hez!” responded Bigler.  
“Then,”sed Deakiu Pogram, his  
eyes tiashin with unwonted lire, “what  
we’ve done and sod don’t count! Take  
that, yoo black cuss!”  
And with the strength and actiTitv !  
wich T hadn&#x27;t look* for in one so agio.  
  
the Deakin fecht the darkey, whose  
hand he hed bin graspin, a most pow­  
erful blow at ween the eyes, which  
liisted him clean off the platform.  
The others follered soot, aud in their  
zeal sprung off the platform after em,  
and wuz a executing war dances uv  
the most frantic descripshen onto pro­  
strate bodies. It wuz with dilhculty  
that Pollock and Bigler restrained em  
from takin uv em out and hanging uv  
em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resolu­  
tion wuz rescinded, and ndopted af­  
finuin our adherence to the copstoo­  
sheu ez it yoost to be, the illegality uv  
the amendments and the natural soo­  
premaey of the white man over the  
d—d niggers; after wicli we adjourned  
to Baseom’s ez is our custom, and  
there organized fresh raids onto our  
natural enemies.  
The next mornin I noticed a pecoo­  
liar look on Bigler’s face, and likewise  
on Pollock’s. They grinned at me cz  
I passed, with a broadnis wich I could­  
n’t account for, Lubbock, the nigger  
Postmaster, burst into a roar ez I  
walked into hiz oilis, and I angrily de­  
manded the reason for his hilarity.  
“ Dat mistake ob Bigler’s,” returned  
he, laughing louder than before.  
*&quot; What mistake?” I asked, turning  
pale, for a suspicion was creepin over  
me.  
“ Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all,  
and—”  
” And all that story about, the split  
in the Republican party North was  
one uv his infernal lies!”  
Dat’s about the correct state ob de  
case!” replied the nigger, showin all  
his iveries.  
“ Bigler wanted to see if your pen­  
tance was genooine—ilat&#x27;s about all  
dah wuz ob it. lie ’sprest a desire to  
assertane jist how peacable yood be to  
de nigger and de Northern people  
down heal), ef dal) wuzu’t no ’Publi­  
can party up North to hold yoo; dat  
wuz all.”  
And nigger laffed a feendisl) laff.  
“ Dat wuz all!” he repeated.

Coxvepprir X Roaps,  
(which is in the State of Kentueky.) }  
May 24, 1871  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv  
the r»litihl field satisficd me, some  
months ago, that without some shift in  
the position uv the di isy, our  
uv smnz exmd.i:mm. .ﬂ:  
resoleoshens interdoost by Vallandygnm  
into the convenshun of the dimocrisy  
nv Montgomery eountv, Ohio, waz to  
me a new life.* Troo, they hav the slite  
disadventyge uv adjoorin’ evervthing  
that is dimocratic, and v p.lti.ﬁ the  
dimoeratic party on purely republiean  
ground, but wat uv that ? | kin stand  
even s 0 sudden a change ez that. Wat  
I want is the soopreme happiness uv  
Kickin® that nigger, Lubbock, out uv  
the post-offis at the Corners, and uv  
putting mysclf in his place, and Kernel  
McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who  
hev bin languishin® outside the offices  
uv assessor and collector, are actocated  
by the same high and hulz impulsis.  
f to do thes requires the o epy&#x27;mg uv  
republikin ground, the war&lt;ry uv us  
three is, “Okepy.” Kcatnckfy 1s sure to  
codimocratic anyhow, and if we Kkin, by  
o simple a process as passin’ resoloo­  
“hens, indoose enuff dissatisfied republi-  
Sins o the clos nothern States to vote  
vith us to eleet a dimoeratie president  
who will give us these boons, we three  
wte tor passin’ these resolovshens, no  
matter wat they are. This bein my  
cnderstandin® uv Vallandygum&#x27;s move­  
ment, I acted onto it to wanst.  
I got the leadin dimocrisy uv the  
Coruers together one pite at Bascom’s.  
That 1T mite get em all at one time, 1  
waited till the regular evenin for the  
raid on the niggers and nothern settlers  
up toards Garrettstown, knowing that  
on their retura they&#x27;d all stop at Bas­  
com’s for a drink, and that ef thev&#x27;d bin  
successful in their hangin and burnin,  
e&#x27;d e o good humer and ready to  
wlopt anything I shood sugi:ot. It waz  
a very short but a very satisfactory con­  
&lt;iultashen. There wuz some obfechlbnns  
on the part uv a few to what they called  
an abandonment of dimoecratic idees,  
hut Bascom settled their hash in very  
&lt;hort meter. He remarked that it wuz  
vecessary that the offises be in the hands  
wv his friends for obvious reasons. He  
wanted pav, and he knowed uv ne other  
way to get it. He believed in the fullest  
freedom of thought and achshen, and  
that every one shood express hisself un­  
‘rameled, bat he coodent abide a idiot.  
I there waz any one in that assemblage  
&lt; tooped ez to differ with him on this  
question, let him make hisself known.  
For sich a fan shood never git a drop  
4t s bar, never : sich a one was notde­  
swrvein uv even the commonest neces­  
caries v life. Several whe had riz ‘to  
their feet to object, dropt as though they  
had been shot,  
It wuz determined to hold a public  
meetin the next nite at the chureh to  
miake a public endorsement of Vallan-  
  
dygum’s idea,  
Ez the prineipal objeet uv the meetin  
wuz to convins the republicans uv the  
doubtful states that the dimoerisy uv  
the South rearly accoptid Clnsituaaun.  
snd meant, in dead earnest, to recognize  
the great principle uv equality, ? ar­  
ranged tok‘! a‘l the niggers uv the  
Corners present, and w\&#x27;uﬁ)r them the  
best seats in the house.. Joe Bigler and  
Pollock come, uv course, which I cood­  
ent help.  
I opened the exercises by making a  
short speech ez 1 took the chair. 1 re­  
jwist that the time had finally arriv when  
the lion and the lamb h‘yh_vedduv­  
together, and a small ehild was leadin  
uv em. | knowd that eur colored fel­  
low-citizens hed been dispitefully voosed,  
and that doo respeek had not bin alluz  
paid to our fellow-eitizens uv the North,  
bud that time hed now passed and 1  
boped forever. The dimoerisy uv the  
through Valland ygum, hed a&amp;: they  
had accepted the sitnashen, Ielo(E.  
and from this time henceforth and for­  
ever there wuz to be nothn’ but peece.  
I then offered the followin 5 resolution :  
® Resolved. That the dimocrisy of

constitooshen doorin and sinee the kte

the fact that the niggers ain’t now ‘{ut

“The republikin party is gone to pie­

“It he,” responded Bigler.

And the mgger laffed a fiendish lafl.  
“Dat wuz all!™ he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. 1 guess the euss found  
out all that he wanted to. Uy course  
this “outrage,” ¢z they will eall it, will  
get into the nothern papers, and uy  
course Vallandygum’s assershun will

Joe Bigler is my evil genius. T shel

 of things?  
Jfasby.  
Mr. Naby and Hit Friends Second the  
Movement of Valla ndigham A Meeting  
in which Mr. Joseph Bigler Takes a  
Part.  
ConfedritX Roads, (which is the state  
of Kentucky,) May 31, 1871. A calm  
and comprehensive survey uv the politi­  
kle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position  
uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success  
was exceedingly thin. The resolooshens  
introdoost by Vallandygum into the con­  
venshun, Ohio, wuz to me a new lite.  
Troo, they hev the elite disadvantage uv  
abjoorin evrything that is Dimocratic,  
and uv puttin the Dimocratic party .on  
purely Republikin ground, but wat uv  
that? I kin stand even so sudden a  
change ez that. Wat I want is the soo­  
preme happiness uv kickin that nigger  
Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Cor­  
ners, and uv puttin myself in his place,  
and Kernel MePelter and Elder Pen  
nibacker who hev bin languishin out­  
side the office uv assessor and collector  
are actooated by the same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the ok-  
kepyin uv Republican grounds, the war  
cry uv us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky  
is shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and  
if we kin by so simple a process ez passin  
resolooshens indoose enufl dissatisfied Re-  
publikins in the close Northern states to  
vote with us to elect a Democratic pres­  
iueut who will give ns these boons, we  
three are for passin these resolooshens  
no matter wat they are. This being my  
understands uv Vallandygum&#x27;s move­  
ment, I actid onto to it at wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Cor  
ners together one nite atBascom&#x27;s. That  
I might get em all at one time, I waited  
till the regler evenin for the raid on the  
niggers aud Northern settlers up toards  
Garrettstowo, knowing that on their re  
turn they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a  
drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful  
in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in  
good humor and ready to adopt anything  
I shood suggest. It wuz a very satisfac  
tory consultashen. There was some ob  
jickshuns on the part uv a few to wat  
they called an abandonment uv Dimo­  
cratic idees, but Bascom settled their  
hash in very short metre. He remarked  
that it wuz necessary that the offises be  
in the hands uv his trends for obvius rea  
sons. He wantid pay and knowed uv  
no other way to git it. He beloeved in  
the fullest freedom uv thought and ack-  
shen, and that every one shood express  
hisself untrameled, but he coodent abide  
a idiot. If there wuz any one in that  
assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with  
him on this question, let him make his  
self known. No sich man shood ever git  
a drop at his bar, never ; sich a one wuz  
not deservin uv even the commonest nes-  
esaries uv life. Several who had riz to  
their feet to object, dropt ez though they  
hed been shot.  
It was determined to hold a public  
meeting the next nite at the church to  
hold make a public indorsement uv Val­  
landygum&#x27;s idea.  
Ez the principle object of the meetin  
wuz to convins the Republikins uv the  
doubtful states that the Dimocrisy uv  
the South really acceptid the situashen,  
and ment, in dead earnest, to recognise  
the great prinsiple uv equality, I arrang­  
ed to hev all the niggers uv the Corners  
present, and saved for em the best seats  
in the house. Joe Bigler and Pollock  
come, uv course, which I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by making a  
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-  
joist that the time hed finally arriv when  
the lion and the Iamb bed layed down  
together and a small child wuz a leadin  
uv em. I knowd that our coloredfellow-citizens  
hed bin dispitefully yoosed,  
and that doo res peck hed net bin alluz  
paid to onr fellow-citizens uv the North,  
but that time hed now passed and I hop  
ed forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North,  
though Vallandygum, hed spoke, they  
bed acceptid the situashen, halleloogy,  
  
and from this time henceforth and forev­  
er there wuz to be nothin but peeoe. I  
then offered the follerin resolooshea :  
HnmlvrH, That the Dimocrwy uv the  
Yoouited States recognizo the legality  
uv all the amendments made the const!­  
tooehon doorin and since the late onpleas­  
antnis, aud that they recognize and most  
heartily acquiesce in all the results of  
the war ; that they not only withdraw all  
their opposishen to yooniyersal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our  
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this  
but all other rites heretofore enjoyed ex­  
cloosively by the Caucashen.  
It put the question ez to theadopshen  
uv the resolooshen, and it was carried  
yoonnanimously. It wood hev bin well  
hed I stopped here, but I didn&#x27;t. My  
prevailin weakness is to slop over and I  
sloptonthis okkashun TearluIIy, I cal­  
led upon the citizens uv the Corners, to  
prove their works. &quot;There ate,&quot; I sed,  
in a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this  
meetin twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens  
uv Afrikin descent. Let era step forrerd  
on this platform let Deekin Pograra,  
Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Issker Ga­  
vitt and eighteen others white citizens  
step forrerd, also. Let them clasp each  
other by the hand while I wave over em  
the flag uv our common kentry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forrered, the whites designated  
advanced, the two lines grasped each  
other by the hand, and I wuz about to  
wave, when Joe Bigler riz. He begged  
me to wait a minit till he had made his  
remark. The site afore him moved him  
almost tu teers. Ef he hed ever harbor­  
ed a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t any­  
thing generous in the Kentucky breast  
he took it all back. The ackshen uv to­  
night wuz not only just, but it wuz gen­  
erous.&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous ?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, &quot;the niggers wood &quot;be  
in a devilish bad way ef you hedn&#x27;t de  
cided on givin em their rites, uv yoor  
own akkord, for there ain&#x27;t nopower new  
that can compel yoo to do it. I just  
got a Northern paper alas ! the Repub­  
lisiu party is split into fragments re­  
markably small fragments. Grant as­  
saulted Sumner in the Capitol, last Mon­  
day, Logan hez been stoned by the Re­  
publikins of Philadelfy on his way home,  
the ceutral committees uv Ohio, Injeany  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each frack­  
uhen hez called a convenshen, and the  
New York Triboon throws up the sponge  
and sez that nothing under heven kin  
prevent the success uv the Democratic  
candidate for the Presidency, no matter  
who be may be or wat platform he is  
put onto. In yiew uv the dissolooshen  
uv the Republikin party, and the fact  
that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no per­  
teckters, its really generous that yoo &quot;  
The Republikin party is gone to piec­  
es ! hez it ?&quot; graBxed my twenty -two  
white friends in korious.  
&quot;It hez I&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, yoo  
black cuss !&quot; . . ;  
And, with the strength and activity  
wich I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid,  
the deekin fecht the damey, whose hand  
he hed bin graspin, a most powerful  
blow atween the eyes wich histed him  
clean off the platform. The others fol­  
lowed soot, and in their zeal sprang off  
the platform after em, and wuz a execu­  
tin war dances of the most frantic des­  
cripihun onto thoir prostrate bodies. It  
wuz with difficulty that Pollock and  
Bigler restrained em from takin uv em  
out and hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resolusion  
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirm­  
in our adherence to the constooshen ez it  
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­  
ments, and the nateral soopremacy uv  
the white man over the d d nigger, aft­  
er wich we adjou-ned to Bascom&#x27;s, ex is  
our custom, and there organised fresh  
raids onto our nateral enemies. &#x27;  
The next mornin I notised a pecool­  
yer look on Bigler&#x27;s face, and likewise  
on Pollock&#x27;s. .They grinned at me ez I  
passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t  
account for. Lubbock, the nigger p ost­  
m aster, bust into a roar ez I walkt into  
his oflis, and I angrily demanded the  
reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake of ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned  
he, laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake,&quot; I asked, turning  
pale, for a suspicion wuz creepin. over  
me.  
&quot;Why he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all,  
and&#x27;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in  
the republikin party North wuz one uv  
his infernal lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de  
case !&quot; replied the nigger, showing all  
his iveries. &quot;Bigler wanted to see if  
yourpretauce wuzgenooine dat&#x27;sabout  
all dah wuz ob it. He&#x27; sprest a desire  
to aseertane jist how peeceable yood be  
to de nigger and de Northern people  
down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no&#x27; Publican  
party up North to hold yoo ; dat wus  
all.&quot;  
And the niggers laffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all !&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found  
out all he wanted to. Uv course this  
&quot;outrage,&quot; as they will call it, will get  
into the Northern papers, and course  
Vallandygum&#x27;s asserchun will explode  
itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Big.  
ler is an avil genius. I shel never be  
able two run things ez I want to so long  
as be lives.

is Democratic, afid uv puttin the Dem­  
cratic party on purely Republikiu grouud,  
but what uv that ? I kin st tud even so

is the soopreme happiness uv kickin that

knowed uv no other way to git it. He  
beleeved in the fullest freedom uv thought

And with a strength and activity with

Deekin frelit the darkey whose band he

Nasby on the Situation.  
MR. NASBY AND HIS FRIENDS SECOND THE  
MOVEMENT OF V A I.L AN DIGRAM—A MEET­  
ING IN WHICH MR. JOS. BIGLER TAKES  
A PART—THE RESULT.  
Confedrit X Roads (which is iu the Stait  
of Keutnck,) May 24, 1871.—A calm and  
comprehensive survey uv the politiklo field  
satisfied me, some months ago, that with­  
out some shift in the position uv the Dim  
ocrisy our hope of success wuz exceedingly  
thin. The resoloosheus introdoost by Val­  
landygum into the Convcnshun uv the  
Dimocrisy uv Montgomery county, Ohio,  
wuz to he a new life. Troo, they have the  
slite disadvantage uv abjooriug everything  
that is Dimocratic, and uv putting the  
Diraocratic party on purely Repuhlikan  
ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand  
even so sudden a change ez that. What I  
want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin  
that nigger Lubbock out uv the post offiis  
at tho Corners and uv putlin myself in his  
place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pen­  
uipaker, who hev been languishin outside  
uv tho offis ov Assessor aud Collector are  
actooated by the same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the okko­  
pyin uv Bepublikiu ground, the war cry uv  
us three iz “okkepy.” Kentucky is shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and ef wo kin  
by so simple a process ez passin resoloo­  
shuns indooso enuff dissatisfied Republi­  
kins in the close Northern States to rote  
with us to elect a Dimocratic President,  
who will give us these boons, wo three are  
for passin these resoloosheus, no matter  
what they arc. This being my understandin  
uv Vallandygum’s movement, I acted onto  
it to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Cor­  
ners together one night at Bascom’s. That  
I might get em all at one time, I waited  
till the roglcr evening for the raid on the  
niggers and Northern settlers up towards  
Garrettstown, knowin that on their return,  
they’d all stop at Bascora&#x27;s for a drink,  
and that if they&#x27;d been successful in their  
hangin and burnin they’d he in a good  
humor, and ready to adopt anything I  
should sugge st. It wuz a very short but a  
very satisfaciry consultashcn. There wuz  
some objeckshuns on the part uv a few to  
what they called an abandonment uv Dim­  
ocratic idocs, hut Bascom settled their bash  
in very short metre. He remarkt that it  
wuz necessary that tho offisis bo in the  
hands uv hi - friends for obvious reezons.  
He wanted ,&gt; iy, and he know&#x27;d of no other  
way to git it. He belseved in the fullest  
freedom uv thought and ackshen, and that  
every one should express himself uutram­  
eled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If thdre  
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid  
as to differ with him on that question, let  
him make himself known. No sich man  
shood ever git a drop at his bar, never ;  
such a one wuz not deservin uv even the  
common necessaries of life. Several who  
had risen to their teet to object, dropt as  
though they had been shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meetin  
the next night at the Church to make a  
public endorsement of Vallaudygum’s idees  
Ez the prinsipal object uv tho meetin  
wuz to convins the Rcpuhlikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the  
South really accepted the situashen, and  
meat in ded earnest to recognize tho great  
prinsipal of equality, I arranged to hev all  
the niggers uv the Corners present and  
save for em the best seats in tho house.—  
Joe Bigler ami Pollock cum uv course,  
which I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by makin a short  
speech cz I took the chair. I rejoist that  
the time hed finally arrived when the lion  
and tho lamb hed layed down together, and  
a child wuz a leedin uv them. I knowd  
that our colored fellow-citizens lied been  
Jispitefully yoosed, and that due respect  
had not been alluz paid to our fellow-citi­  
zens uv the North, hut that time had now  
passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimoc­  
risy uv the North through Vallandygum  
hed spoke; they hed accepted the situa­  
shen; halleloogy, and from this time hence­  
forth and forever there wuz nothin hut pecce  
I then offered the following resolooshen :  
llenolred, That tho Dimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality of all  
the amendments to the constitooshen door­  
ing and since the late onpleasantniss, and  
that they recognize and most heartily  
acquiesce in all the results uv the war;  
that they not only withdraw all their oppo­  
sition to yooniversal snfferage, hut pledge  
theirsclves to see that our African fellow­  
citizeus hev not only this hut all the rites  
heretofore enjoyed exclusively by the Cau­  
cashen.  
1 put tho question as to the adoption of  
the resolooshcn, and it wuz carried yoonan­  
imously. It wood hev been well hed I  
stopi&gt;od here, hut I didn&#x27;t. My prevailin  
weakness is to slop over, and I slopt on  
this okkashen fearfully. I called upon the  
citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith  
by their works. “ There are,” I said, in a  
spasm of delight, “ present at this meetin  
twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens of Afr

kin descent. Let era step forred on this  
platform—let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pen­  
nibacker, Bascom, Isakeor Gavitt and eigh­  
teen other white citizens step forred, also.  
Let them clasp each other by the hand  
while I ware over them the flag of our  
common kontry.”  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated  
advanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I was about to ware when  
Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to wait a  
minit till he had made his remark. The  
site before him almost moved him to tears.  
Ef ho hed ever harbored a suspishen that  
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Ken­  
tucky breast, he took it all back. The  
aeshun uv to nito wuz not only Just but it  
wuz generous.  
“Generous!” said I, “whygenerous?”  
“ Becoz,” said lie, “ the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way ef you hedn’t deci­  
ded on given era their rites uv your own  
akkord, for there ain&#x27;t no power now that  
can compel you to doit. Ijist got a North­  
ern paper—alas ! the Rcpuhlikin party is  
split into fragments, remarkably small  
fragments. Grant assaulied Sumner in the  
Capitol last Monday; Logan has been  
stoned by the Rcpuhlikins uv Philadelfy  
on his way home ; the Central Committees  
of Ohio, Injeany and Illinois hev divided,  
and each fraeshen has called a convcnshun,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under hevin kin  
prevent the success uv the Dimikratic can­  
didate for the Presidency, no matter who  
he may be or wot platform he is put onto.  
In view of the dissolooshcn uv the Repub­  
likin party, and the fact that the niggers  
ain’t now got no protectors, its really gen­  
erous that yoo ”  
“ The Republikin party is gone to pieces,  
hez it?” gasped my twenty-two white  
friends in korious.  
“ It hez,” responded Bigler.  
“Then,” said Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashing with unwontid fire, “what we’ve  
done and sed don’t count 1 Take that, you  
black cuss.”  
And with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, tho Deekin  
fecht the darkey whose hand he had been  
graspin, a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which histed him clean off the plat­  
form. The others followed suit, aud in  
their zeal sprung off the platform after era,  
aud wuz a cxecutin war dances uv the most  
frantic descripshen unto their prostrate  
bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock  
and Bigler restrained em from taken uv em  
out and hangin uv em.  
Ez matter uv course the resolooshcn wuz  
recinded, and others adopted affirrain our  
adherence to the Constitution ez it yoost  
to be, the illegality uv the amendments,  
and the natural soopremacy uv the white  
man over the d—d uigger, after which wo  
adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our custom,  
and there organized fresh raids onto our  
natural enemies.  
The next moruiu I noticed a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler’s face, likewise on Pollock’s.  
They grinned at me as I passed with a  
broadnis I coodent account for. Lubbock,  
the nigger postmaster, bust into a roor as I  
walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded  
the reason of his hilarity.  
“ Dat mistake oh Bigler’s,” returned he,  
laughing louder than before.  
“ What mistake ?” I asked, turning pale,  
for suspicion was creepin over me.  
“ Why, he didn’t get no paper at all,  
and—”  
“ And all that story about the split iu  
the Rcpublikin party North wuz one uv his  
infernal lies?”  
“ Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de  
&#x27;case 1” replied the nigger, showing his  
ivories.  
“ Bigler wanted too see ef your pentance  
wuz genooine—dat’s all dah wuz ob it.—  
He ’sprest desire to assortane jist how  
peccable yood be to do nigger and do  
Northern people down heah, ef da wuzn&#x27;t  
Publikin party up North to hold yoo ; dat  
wuz all.”  
And the nigger laffed a fiendish laff.  
That wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found  
out all he wanted to. Uv coorse this  
“outrage” as they will call it, will git into  
the Northern papers, and uv coorse Vallan­  
dygum’s assershun will explode without  
hurting anybody. Joe Bigler is my evil  
genius. I shel never be able to run things  
ez I want to so long ez he lives.
