**Nasby on the New Departure.**  
  
[From the Toledo Blade.]  
  
Confederate X Roads, (wich iz in the State of Kentucky, May 24, 1871)  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the politikle field satisfied me, some months ago, that without some shift in the position uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedingly thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Vallandygham into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisiy uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand even so sudden a change ez that! Wat I want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin outside the offices uv assessor and collector are actooatid by the same high and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so simple a process ez passin resolooshens indoose enuff dissatisfied Republikins in the close Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic President who will give us these boons, we three are for passin these resolooshens no matter what they are. This bein my understandin uv Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it to wunst.  
  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Corners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That I mite get em all at one time, I waited till the regler evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good humor and ready to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very short but a very satisfactry consultashen. There wuz some objickshuns on the part uv Dimocratic idees, but Bascom settled their hash in very short metre. He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the offfises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the fullest freedom uv though and ackshen, and that every one shood express hisself untrammeled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him on that question, let him make hisself known. No sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to object dropt ez though they hed bin shot.  
  
It wuz determined to hold a public meetin the next nite at the church to make a public endorsement uv Vallandygum&#x27;s idees.  
  
Ez the principal objict uv the meetin wuz to convins the Republikins uv the doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the South really accepted the situashun, and ment, in ded ernest, to recognize the great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to hev all the niggers uv the Corners present, and saved for them the best seats in the ouse. Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I coodent help.  
  
I opened the exercises by making a short speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the time hed finally arriv when the lion and the lamb hed lain down together, and a small child wuz leading uv em. I knowed thet our colored fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yoosed, and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North, Vallandygum, hed spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy, and from this time henceforth and forever there wuz to be nothin but peece. I then offered the follerin resolooshen:  
  
&quot;*Resolved*, That the Dimocrisy uv the Yoonited States recognize the legality uv all the amendments made to the Constitooshen dooring and since the late onpleasantnis, and that they recognise and most heartily acquiesce in all the results uv the war; that they not only withdraw all their opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, but pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively by the Caucashen.&quot;  
  
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev been well hed I stopped there, but I didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekness is to slop over, and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, in a spasm of delite, &quot;preset at this meetin twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin descent. Let em step forred on this platform--let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Issaker Gavitt, and eighteen other white citizens step forred also. Let them clasp each other by the hand while I wave over em a flag uv our common kontry.&quot;  
  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers stepped forred, the whites designated advanced, the two lines grasped each other by the hand, and I was about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize. He begged me to wait a minnit till he made his remark. The site afore him moved him almost to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen that there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz generous.  
  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for ther ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern paper--alas! the Republikin party is split into fragments--remarkably small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by the Republikins uv Philadelfy on his way home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany, and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz called a convenshen, and the Noo York *Triboon* throws up the sponge and sez that nothin under the hevin can prevent the success uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, no matter who he may be or wat platform he is put onto. In view uv the disolooshen uv the Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no perteckers, it&#x27;s really generous that yoo--&quot;  
  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces! hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends in korious.  
  
&quot;It hez!&quot; responded Bigler.  
  
&quot;Then,&quot; said Deekin Pogram, his eyes flashin with unwonted fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss?&quot;  
  
And with a strength and activity which I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin fecht the darkey whose hand he hed bin graspin, a most powerful blow atween the eyes which histed him clean off the platform, the others followed soot, and in their zeal sprang off the platform after em, and wuz a executin war dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto their prostrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from takin uv em out and hanging uv em.  
  
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen wuz recinded, and others adopted affirm our adherence to the constitooshen ez it yoost to be, the illegality uv the amendments, and the nateral soopremacy uv the white man over the d--d nigger, after wich we adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom, and there organized fresh raids onto our nateral enemies.  
  
The next morning I noticed a pecoolyer look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the nigger postmaster, bust into a roar ez I walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded the reason for his hilarity.   
  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Biglers,&quot; returned he, laughing louder than before.  
  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turning pale, for a suspishen was creepin over me.  
  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and--&quot;  
  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the Republikin party North wuz one uv his infernal lies!&quot;  
  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case!&quot; replied the nigger, showin all his ivories. &quot;Bigler want to see ef yoor &#x27;pentance wuz genoeine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob it. He sprest a desire to assertane jist how peeceable yood be to de nigger and de Northern people down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no &#x27;Publikin party up North to hold yoo; dat wuz all.&quot;  
  
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.  
  
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out all that he wanted to. Uv cours this &#x27;outrage,&#x27; ez they call it, will get into the Northern papers, and uv cours Vallandygum&#x27;s assershun will explode itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Bigler iz my evil genius. I shel never be able to run things ez i want to so long ez he lives.

May 25, 1871.  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey  
uv the politikle field satisfied me,  
some months ago, that without some  
shift in the position of the Dimocracy,  
our hope uv success wuz exceedingly  
thin. The rezolooshens interdoost by  
Vallandygum into the Convenshun of  
the Dimocracy uv Montgumery coun­  
ty, Ohio, wuz to me a new lite. Troo,  
they have the slite disadvantage uv  
abjoorin everthing that is Dimocratic,  
and uv puttin the Dimocratic party  
on purely Republican ground, but wat  
uv that? I kin stand even so suddin  
a change ez that. Wat I want is the  
soopreme happiness uv kickin that  
nigger Lubbock out uv the postoffis at  
the Corners, and uv puttin myself in  
his place, and Kernal McPelter and  
Elder Pennibacker who hev bin lan-  
guishin outside the offises uv Assessor  
and Collector, are actooatid by the  
same high and holy impulses. Ef to  
do this requires the ockepyin of Re-  
publickin ground, the war cry uv us  
three is &quot;ockepy.&quot; Kentucky is shoor  
to go Democratic anyhow, and if we  
kin by so simple a process ez passin  
resolooshens indoose enulf dissatisfed  
Republickins in the close Northern  
states to vote with us to elect a Dimo  
cratic President who will give us these  
boons, we three are for passin these  
resolooshens no matter what they are.  
This being my understandin uv Val­  
landygum&#x27;s movement, I acted onto it  
to wunst.  
I got the leadin Dimocracy uv the  
Corners, together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s.  
That I mite git em all at one time  
Us  
for the  
waited till the reglar evenin  
raid on the niggers and northern set-  
tiers up toards Garretstown, knowin  
that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at  
Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that ef  
they&#x27;d been successful in their hangin  
and burnin they&#x27;d be in good humor  
and ready to adopt anything I shood  
uggest. It was a very short consul  
tashun but very satisfactry. There  
wuz some objecshuns on the part of a  
few to what they called an abandon  
ment ny Dimocratic ideas, but Bas  
com settled their hash in very short  
meter. He remarkt that it wuz neces  
sary that the offises be in the hands of  
his friends for obvious reasons. He  
wantid pay and he knowed uv no oth  
er way to git it. He believed in the  
fullest freedom uv thought and ack  
shen, and that every one shood ex  
press himself untrameled, but he  
coodn&#x27;t abide a idiot. If there wuz  
any one in the assemblige so stupid ez  
to differ with him on this question, let  
him make hisself known. No sich  
man ever shood git a drop at his bar,  
never; sich a man wuz not deservin  
uv even the commonest necessaries uv  
life. Several who had riz to their feet  
to object, dropt ez though they hed  
bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public  
meetin the next nite at the church to  
make a public endorsement of Vullan  
dygum&#x27;s idea.  
the prinsiple oblick of the meet  
in wuz to convins the Republicans uv  
the doubtful States that the Dimocra  
cy uv the South really acceptid the  
situashen, and ment, in dead earnest,  
to recognize the great principle uv  
equality, I arranged to have all the  
niggers uv the Corners present, and  
saved for em the best seats in the  
house. Joe. Bigler and Pollock come,  
uv course, wich I coodn&#x27;t help.  
I opened the exercises by makin  
short speech ez I took the chair. I re-  
a leaden uv em. I knowd that our  
colored fellow-citizens hed been dis-  
pitefully yoosed, and that doo respeck  
hed not been alluz paid to our fellow-  
citizens of the North, but that time  
hed now passed and I hoped forever.  
The Dimocracy of the North, through  
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they hed  
accepted the situashen, halleloogy, and  
from this time henceforth and foreve  
therewuz to be nothing but peece. I  
then offered the follerin resolooshen:  
Resolved, That the Dimocrisy of the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality  
uv all the amendments made to the  
Constitooshen doorin and since the  
onpleasantnis, and most heartily ac  
quiesce in all the results uv the war  
that they not only withdraw all their  
oppossihen to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our  
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only  
this right but all others heretofore en­  
joyed excloosively by the Caucashen.  
I put the question ez to the adop  
nen uv the resoloosheen, and it wuz  
carried yoonanimusly. It wood hey  
bin well hed I stopped here, but I  
didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekness is to  
slop over and I slopt on this okkashen  
fearfully. I called upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to prove their faith by  
their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said in a  
spasm of delite, present at this meet  
in twer ty-two uv our fellow-citizens  
uv Afrikin descent. Let em step  
forrerd on this Dlatform,--ie0 IleekiH  
Pogram, Elder Pennibacker, Bascom.  
Issaker Gavitt and eighteen other  
white citizens stepped forrerd, also,  
Let em clasp each other by the hand  
while I wave over em the flag uy our  
common kentry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty two nig­  
gers stepped forred, the whites desig­  
nated advanced, the two lines grasped  
each other by the hand, and I wuz  
about to wave, when Joe Bigler riz.  
He begged me to wait a minit till he  
hed made his remark. The site afore  
him moved him almost to teers. Tf  
he had ever harbored a suspishen that!  
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the  
Kentucky breast he took it all back  
The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not only  
just but it wuz generous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed he, &quot;the niggers  
wood be in a devlish bad way ef voo  
nedn&#x27;t decided on givin em their rites,  
uv yoor own akkord for there ain&#x27;t no  
power now that kin compel yoe to do  
it. I jist got a northern paper--alas  
the Republikin party is split into frag  
ments-remarkably small fragments.  
Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capi  
tol, last Monday, Logan hez bin  
stoned by the Republikins uv Phila  
delfy on his way home, the Central  
Committees uv Chio. Inieany and  
Tilinoy hey divided, and each frack  
shen hez called a convenshen, and the  
Triboon throws up the  
ponge and sez that nothin under  
hevin kin prevent the success uv the  
the Democratic candidate for the  
Presidency, no matter who he may be  
or wat platiorm he is put onto. In  
iew uv the dissolooshen uv the Re  
publikin party, and the fact that the  
niggers ain&#x27;t now got no perteclters.  
its really generous that yoo  
The Repulikin party is gone to  
pleces! hez it?&quot; gasped my tuenty.  
I hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-  
two white friends in Korious.  
&quot;It hez!&quot; respondid Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Deekin Pogram, his  
eyes flashin with unwontid fire,  
What we&#x27;ve Done And sed poN&#x27;t  
connt! Take that, Yoo Black  
cuss!&quot;  
And with a strength and activity  
wich I hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid  
the Deckin fecht the darkey whose  
hand he hed bin graspin, a most  
powerful blow atween the eyes which  
histed him clean off the platform  
The others follered soot, and in their  
teal sprang off the platform after em  
and wuz a executin war dances uy the  
most frantic descripshen onto their!  
prostrate bodies. It wuz with dim.  
culty that Pollock and Bigler restrain-I  
ed em from takin uv em out and  
hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resaloo-  
shen wuz rescinded, and others adopt.  
affirmin our adherence to the tht  
tooshen ez it yoost to be, the illegall  
ty uv the amendments, and the  
nateral soopremacy uv the white man  
over the d--d nigger after wich we ad.  
journed to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom  
and there organized fresh raids onto  
our nateral enemies.  
The next mornin I notised a  
lyer look on Bigler&#x27;s face and like­  
wise on Pollock&#x27;s. They grinned at  
me ezI passed, with a broadnis wich  
couldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the  
nigger Postmaster, bust into a roar eg  
walked into his offis, and I ancrily  
demandid the reason for his hilarity  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned  
he, laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turnin  
pale, for a suspishun wuz crecpin over  
me.  
Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all  
and-  
  
&quot;And all that story about the split  
in the Republikin party North wuz  
one uv his infernal lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de  
case!&quot; replied the nigger showln all  
his ivories. &quot;Bigler wanted to see ef  
yoor pentance wuz genooine--dat&#x27;s  
about all dah wuz ob it. He &#x27;sprest a  
desire to assertane jist how peeceable  
yood be to de nigger and de Northern  
people down heah, ef dan wuzn&#x27;t no  
Publikin party up North to hold yoo;  
dat wuz all.&quot;  
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found  
out all that he wanted to. Uv course  
this &quot;outrage,&quot; ez they call it, will git  
nto the northern papers, and uv  
course Vallandygum&#x27;s assershun will  
explode itself without hurtin any  
body. Joe Bigler is my evil genius.  
I shel never be able to run things ez I  
want to so long ez he lives.

(Wicli is in the SUte of %  
A calm and comprehensive survey nv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv  
the Diinocricy, our hope uv success was ex­  
ceedingly thin. The resoloosbens introdoost  
by Vallandygum into the convenshua uv  
the Dimocrisy uv Montgomery county,  
Ohio, wuz to ine a new lite. Troo, they  
hev the elite disadvantage uv abjoonn  
every thing that is Ditnocratic, and  
uv puttin the Dimoeratic party on  
purely ltepublikin ground; but wat ol that?  
I kin stand even so sudden a change as that.  
YVat I want is the soopreme happiness of  
kiekin that nigger Lubbock out of the post­  
offis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in  
his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder  
Pennibackpr, who liev been languishin out­  
side the ottiises uv assessor and collector,  
are actooated by tbe same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the okke­  
pvin uv Republican ground, the war cry uv  
us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky :s shoor  
to go Dimecrutic aryliow, aud it we kin by  
so simple a process ez passin resoloosbens  
indoose enutt&#x27;dissatistied Republikins in the  
close Northern States to vote with us to  
elect a Democratic president who will give  
us these boons, we three are for passin these  
resoloosbens,no matter wat they are. ibis  
bein my uuderstandin uv Y allaudygum s  
movement, I actid onto it to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimoericy uv the Cor­  
ners together one nite at Baseom&#x27;s. That I  
mite get era all at one time, I waited till the  
regler evenin for the raid on the niggers  
and Northern settlers up toards Garcetts­  
town, kiiowin that, on ther return, they&#x27;d  
all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and that,  
ef the&#x27;d bin successful in their haugin and  
buruin, they&#x27;d be iu good humor and ready  
to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz  
a very short but a very satisfactory consul­  
tasheu. There was some objeekshus on the  
partuvafewto wat they called an aban­  
donment uv Dimoeratic ideas, but Bascom  
settled their hash in very short meter. He  
remarked that it wuz necessary that the  
offise8 lie in the hands uv his friends lor  
ohvlus reasons. He wantid pay and he  
knowed uv no other way to git ic. He be­  
leeved in the fullest ifeedom uv thought  
and ackshen, and that every one shood ex­  
press hisself untrameled, but he coodent  
abide a idiot. It&#x27; there wuz any one in that  
assemblage so stoopid as to differ with him  
on this question, let him make hisself  
known. No sick man shood ever get a drop  
at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not de­  
servin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv  
life. Several who liad riz to their feet to  
object, dropt ez though thev hed been shot.  
It wuz determined to kohl a public rneetin  
the next nite at the church to make a pub­  
lic endorsement of Y&#x27;allandygum&#x27;s idea.  
Ez the priusiple objick of the meetin wuz  
to convius the Republikins uv tlie doubtful  
states that the Dimoericy of the South really  
aeceptid the situashen, and meant, iu dead  
earnest, to recognise the great priusiple uv  
equality, 1 arranged to have all the niggers  
uv the Corners present, aud saved for era  
the best seats iu the house. Joe Bigler aud  
Pollock come, uv course, which I coodent  
help.  
I opened the exercises by making a short  
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist that  
the time had finally arriv when the lion aud  
the lamb hed layed down together anil a  
small child was a leadin uv em. I knowd  
that onr colored teller-citizens hed been die­  
pitefully voosed. and that doo respeck bed  
not bin alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv  
the North, but that time hed now passed  
and I hoped forever. The Dimoericy uv  
the North, through Y&#x27;allaudyguin, bed spoke,  
they hed accepted the situashen, halleloogy,  
anil from this time henceforth anil forever  
there wuz to be nothin but peeee.  
Ur sol red. That the Dimoericy uv the  
Y&#x27;oonited States recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the cous&#x27;titoo­  
shen doorin and since the late onph-asant­  
nis, and that they recognize and most  
heartily acquiesce in all the results of the  
war; that they not only w ithdraw all their  
opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, lint  
pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin  
fellow-citizens hev not only this but all  
other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively  
by the Caucashen.  
I pnt the question ez to the adopshen uv  
the resolushen, and it wuz carried yoonani­  
mouslv. It wood av bin well lied I stopped  
here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. Mv prevaliu weakness  
is to slop over, aud I slopped on this ukka­  
sion fearfully. I called upon the citizens  
uv the Corners to prove their faith by their  
works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said, iu a spasm uv  
delite, &quot;present at this meetin twenty-two  
uv our fellow citizens uv Afrikin descent.  
Let em step forrerd on this platform—let  
Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibaeker. Bas­  
com, Issacker Gavitt, aud eighteen other  
white citizens step forrerd also. Let them  
clasp each other by the hand, while I wave  
over em the flag of our common kentrv.&quot;  
It was done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forrerd, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other by

atore him moved him almost tu teers. Ef  
he hed harbored a suspiskeu that there  
wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Kentucky  
breast, he took it all hack. The action uv  
to-uite wuz not only just but it wuz gen­  
erous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;wby generous ?&quot;  
&quot;Beeoz,&quot; sed lie, &quot;the niggers wood lie in  
a devilish bad way ef you hedn&#x27;t decided on

[From the Toledo Blade.]  
Coxfedrit X Roads, Y  
(which is in the State of Kentucky,) &gt;  
May 24-, 1871. _ &gt;  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv  
the politikle field satisfied me, some  
months ago, that with some shift in the  
position uv the Dimocrisv, our hope uv  
success wuz cxeeedinly thin. The reso­  
looshens interdoost by&#x27; Vallandygum into  
the Convenshun of the Dimocrisy uv Mont­  
gomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new  
ife. Troo, they her the slite disadvan­  
tage uv adjooring everythin that is Dinto­  
cratic, and uv puttin the Dimoeratic party  
on Kepublikin ground, but wat uv that? I  
kin stand even so sudden a change ez that  
Wat I want is the soopreme happiness uv  
kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the  
postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin my­  
self in his place, and Kernel MePelter and  
Elder Pennibacker who hev bin languish­  
in outside the offices uv Assessor and  
Collector are actooated by the same high  
and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires  
the okkepyin uv Kepublikin ground, the  
war cry uv us three is “okkepy.” Ken­  
tucky is shoor to go Democratic anyhow,  
and if we kin by so simple a process ez  
pass in resolooshens indoose enutf dissatis­  
fied Kepublikins in the close Northern  
States to vdte with us to elect a Democrat­  
ic President who will give us these boons,  
we three are for passin these resolooshens  
no matter wat they are. This bein my  
understandin uv Vailandygum&#x27;s movement  
I acted onto it to wunst.  
I got the leadin Dimmoerisy of the  
Cornets together one nite at liascom&#x27;s.  
That I mite get em all at one time, I wait­  
ed till the regler evenin for the raid on  
the niggers and northern settlers up to­  
wards Garrettstown, knowin that on their  
return they’d all stop at liascom&#x27;s for a  
drink, and that ef they’d bin successful in  
their hangin and burnin they’d be in good  
humor and ready to julopt anythin I shood  
suggest. It wuz a short but very satisfac­  
try consultashen. There wuz some ob­  
jickshuns on the part uv a few, to wat they  
called an abandonment uv Dimoeratic  
idees, but llaseom settled their hash in  
very short metre. Ife remarkt that it wuz  
necessary that the offises be in the hands  
uv his friends for obvius reasons. He  
wantid pay and lie kuowed uv no other  
way to git it. lie beleeved in the fullest  
freedom uv thought and ackshen, and that  
every one shood express hisself untram­  
meled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If  
there wuz any one in that assemblage so  
stupid ez to differ with him on ttiat ques­  
tion, let him make hisself known. No  
sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar,  
never; sich a one wuz notdeservin of even  
the commonest nesessaries uv life. Seve­  
ral who lied riz to their feet to object  
dropt ez though they lied bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meet­  
in the next nite at the church to make a  
public endorsement uv Yallandygum’s  
idees.  
  
J&#x27;.z me pnnsipai object uv the meetin  
wuz to convins the Kepublikius uv the  
doubtful Suites that the Pimoerasy uv the  
South really accepted the situashou, and  
nient, in tied earnest, to recognize the  
great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to  
hev all the niggers uv the Corners present  
and saved for ent the best seats in the  
house. Joe Bigler and Pollock cum uv  
eoorse, which L coodent help.  
1 opened Ihe exercises by makin a short  
speech ez I took the chair. L rejoist that  
the time had finally arriv when the lion  
and the lamb bed layed down together,  
and a small child wuz a leadin uv cm. I  
knowed that our colored fellow-citizens  
lied bin dispitefully yoosed, and that doo  
respeek hed not bin alluz paid to our fel­  
low-citizens uv the North, but that time  
hed now passed, aud 1 hoped forever.  
The Pimocrisy uv the North, through  
Yallandygum, hed spoke, they hed ac­  
cepted the situashen, halleloogv, and from  
this time henceforth and forever there  
wuz to lie nothiu but peace. 1 then offer­  
ed the following resotooshen:  
Resolved. That the Pimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States, recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the Consti­  
toosheu dooring and since the late on­  
pleasantnis, and that they recognize and  
most heartily acquiesce in all the results  
uv the war; that they not only withdraw  
all their opposhen to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our Afri­  
kin fellow-citizens hev not only tills but  
all other rites heretefore enjoyed cxeloo­  
sively by the Caucashen.  
  
1 put the question ez to the aitopshen uv  
the resoloosheu, and it wuz carried yoo­  
nauimusly. It wood liev bin well bed I  
stopped here, but 1 didn&#x27;t. My prevalin  
weekness is to slop over and I slopt on  
this okknsion uv the Corners to prove their  
faith by their works. ‘There are,’ I said,  
in a spasm of delitc, ‘present at this  
meetin twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens  
uv Afrikin descent. Let cm step forred  
on this platform—let Deckin Togram,  
Elder Pennibacker.Uascom, IssakerGavitt  
and eighteen other white citizens step for­  
red. also. Let them clasp each other by  
the hand while I wave over em the flag uv  
our common kentry.’  
It was done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I wuz about to wave,  
when Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to  
wait a rninit till lie had made his remark.  
The site afore him moved him almost to  
teers. Kf he lied ever harbored a suspish­  
eu that there wuzn’t anything generous in  
the Kentucky breast, lie took it all back.  
The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not only just,  
but it was generous.  
“Generous!” sed I, “ why generous?”  
“Becoz,” sed he, “the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way cf yoo liedn’t decided  
on givin em their rites, uv yoor own ak­  
kord, for there aiut no power now that kin  
compel yoo to do it. i jist got a northern  
paper—alas! the Kepublikin party is split  
  
into fragments—remarkably small frag­  
ments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the  
Capitol last Monday, Logan hez bin ston­  
ed by the Ilepublkins uv Philadelfy on his  
way home, the Central Committees uv  
Ohio, Injeny and lllinoy, hev divided, and  
each ftackshen hez called a convenshen,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under heven  
kin prevent the success uv the Democratic  
candidate for the Presidency, no matter  
who he may be or wat platform he is pi^t  
onto. In view uv the dissolooshen uv the  
Republikin party, and the fact that the  
niggers aint how got no perteckters, its  
really generous that voo——”  
“The Republikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it? gapped my twentjySW white  
friends in korious.” &quot;  
“It hez.” responded &#x27;  
“Then,&quot; sed Deekin Ingram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, “What we’ve  
done and sed don’t count! Take that, you  
black cuss!” t ( -*  
Ami with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin  
feclit the darkey whose hand he hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which lusted him clean off the plat­  
form. The others follered soot, and in  
their zeal sprang off the platform after eni,  
and wuz a exeeutin war dances uv the  
most frantic descripshen onto their pros­  
trate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that  
Pollock and Bigler restrained em from  
takin uv em out and hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen  
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirmiu  
our adherence to the constooshen ez it  
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­  
ments, and the nateral soopremaPy uv the  
white man over the d—d nigger, after wich  
we adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our cus­  
tom, and there organized fresh raids onto  
our natural enemies.  
The next mornin I notised a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pol­  
lock&#x27;s. They grinned at me ez I passed,  
with a broadnis I couldn’t account for.  
Lubbock, the nigger Postmaster, bust into  
a roor ez I walked into his offis, and I an­  
grily demandid the reason for his hilarity.  
“Dat mistake of Bigler’s,” returned he,  
laughin’ louder than before.  
“What mistake?” I asked, turnin pale,  
for a suspishun wuz creepin over me.  
“Why, he didn’t get no papers at all,  
and—’’  
  
“Anil all that story about that split in  
the Republiken party North wuz one uv  
his infernal lies!’’  
“Dat&#x27;s about lie correct state ob de case!”  
replied the nigger showin all his ivories,  
“liigler wanted to see ef yoor pentance  
wuz &quot;enooine—dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob  
it. lie ’sprest a desire to assertane jist  
how peeceable yood be to de nigger and  
do Northern people down heali, ef dah  
wuzn’t no Tublikin party up North to hold  
yoo; dat wuz all.”  
And the nigger luffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all!” he repeated.  
It wuz euuff. I guess the cuss found out  
all that he wanted to. Uv course this ‘out­  
rage,’ cz they call it, will get into the  
Northern papers, and uv course Vallandy­  
gum’s assershuns will explode itself with­  
out hurtiu anybody. Joe Bigler is my  
evil genius. 1 she! never be able to ruu  
things ez I want to so long ez he lives.

CoFEDRIT X Rc-iDS,  
(Wich is in tbe State nv Kentucky,)  
May 24, 1871.  
A cam and rnraorehen.ivo survey uv the  
pnlitikle field s-itifiid me, some months  
ago, that without some shift in tbe pnsisb­  
un uv the Dimncrisy, our hope uv success  
wui exceedinly thin. The reso&#x27;ooshens in­  
terdoist I y Vallandygiim into the Cnnven­  
shnn uv the Dimncrisy uv Montgomery  
County. Ohio, wuz tn me a new lite. Tron,  
they hev the slite disadvantage nv nbjonrin  
everything that.is Dimncratic nnd nv put­  
tin the Dimocratie party on purely Brpnh­  
likin ground, hut wnt ur that? I kin stand  
even so sudden a change rz that. Wnt I  
want, is the annprcme happiness ov kiekin  
that nigger Lnbhnck out nv the pest nffis at  
the Corners, nnd uv pnttin mvself in his  
place, and Kernel MePelternnd Elder Pen­  
nibacVer, who hey bin langntshin outside  
tbe offices uy Assesser nnd Coll -cter, nre  
aetnoatid by tho same high nnd holy im  
pulse. Ef tn do this requires the okkepv-  
n uv Kepuiilixin ground, tha war crv uv  
us three is &quot;okkepv.&quot; Kentucky is shonr  
tn go Dimocritic anyhow, nnd if we kin.  
hy so simple a process ez pasain resnl.io­  
aliens, indnnae ennfi&quot; d&#x27;ssatisfiej Repub i-  
kins in the close Northern States tn vote  
with us to el-ct a Dimocratia President win  
will give us these boons we theeo nre for  
pasain these resnlooshens, no matter wat  
they are. This bein my understandin uv  
Vnllandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it  
to wunst.  
I got the leedin Diraocraev uv the Cor  
ners tngether nnc nite nt Biscim&#x27;s. Th it  
I mite git em all nt one tim, I waited till  
the regler tvenin for the raid on the nig­  
gers and Northern settlers np toards G ir­  
retutown, knowin that on their return  
they&#x27;d nil stop nt B iscom&#x27;s for n drink, nnd  
that t f they&#x27;d bin succ-ssful in ther hangin  
nnd burnin, they&#x27;d he in good humor, nnd  
reddv tn ndopt anything I shood sejest.  
It wuz a very short but a very satisfactory  
consult isben. Ther wuz some objecksbuns  
on tho part uv n few to wat they called a  
abandonment uv Dimocratie ijces, but Bas­  
eom settle I ther hash in very short metre.  
II&#x27; remarkt that it wuz neas irv tb it the  
o fines be in the bands uvhii fren Is. for  
nbrius rensons. lis wantid pay, nnd he  
knnwed uv no other way to git it. n  
beleeyed in the fullest frcednum uv thought  
nnd ackshen. nnd that every one shood ex­  
press hisself untrimelcd, but be coodent  
nhide. a idiot. If ther wuz nnv nnc in that  
assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him  
on this question, let him make hisself  
known. No sich man shood ever git a drop  
at his bar, never: sich a one wuz not de­  
servin uv even the commonest nesesirics  
uv life. Sever il who bed riz to ther feet  
to object, dropt ez tho they bed bin shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meet­  
in the next nite, nt the church, to make a  
public endorsement uv Vnllnndygum&#x27;s ijee.  
Ez the prinsiple objek uv tbe meetin  
wuz tn convins tbe Repuhlikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrisy ur the  
South really acceptid tbe situash&#x27;en, and  
meant, in ded ernest. to recognize the  
grate prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to  
hev all the niggers uv the Corners present,  
and saved for em tbe best seats in the  
house. Joe Bigler and Pollock come, uv  
coarse, wich I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises hy m.ikin a short  
speech rz I took the cheer. I rrjoist that  
the time bed finally arriv vcben tbe lion and  
the Iamb bed laved down together, nnd a  
small child wuz a leadin uv cm. I knowd  
that our colored feller-citizens hed bindis-pit-folly  
vnnst-d, and that doo respeck bed  
not bin niluz paid to our feller-citizens uv  
the North, hut that time hed now passed,  
and I hoped forever. Tb Dimocrisy uv  
the North, throo Vallandygum, hed spoke;  
thev bed accepted tbe situaaben, hnlleloogy,  
and from this time henceforth and forever  
ther wuz to bo nothin but peece. I then  
offered the follerin rsnlnshen:  
Rtsolrti, That tbe Dimocrisy uv the  
Tnonited States recognize the legality uv  
an ton amendments madi tn ins Uonstitno­  
shen dnorin and since the late nopleasant­  
nis, and that they recognize and most birt­  
ily aequies in all the reealts nv the war;  
that they do not only withaVawnll therop-posish-n  
toy ionirersil suffrage, iut pledge  
tberseives to see tr-at nor Atniin Teller cit­  
izens hev not only this, but nil other rites  
-heretofore enjiyed excloosively by tbe Cau-  
casbea.  
f f t tbe question ez tn tba ndnpshen ur  
the resojoash&#x27;a, and it wax carried voonan­  
imusly. It rn hev bin well lied I stop­  
ped here, but 1 did. My prevalin weak­  
ness is tn slop over, and 1 slopt ta this ok­  
kabnn frwrfully. I called vnym the citi  
zens uv the Corners to prove ther faith hy  
ther worts. ther are,&quot; i sea in , spasm  
OT delite, &#x27;&#x27;present at this meetin twenty  
two uv our feller ciliiens uv Afrikin de-  
s:ent.  
Let em step forrerd on this platform  
1 let Deekin Ppgrarn, Elder Prnnibacker,  
Bascom, Issaker Garitt, and eigbteerj other  
  
white citizens, step forreid, alsj. Let em  
  
clasp each other by the band, wbrle I ware  
over em the Hag uy our common Keniry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped fnrrerd, tbe whites designated ad­  
vanced, tbe two lir.es grasped each other by  
theMnnd, and I wuz about tojrave, when  
Joe Bigler riz. He begged&#x27;inevi&#x27;o wait a  
minit, till he bed made bis remark, ibe  
site nfore bim moved bim almost to teers.  
Ef be bed ever harbored a srjspisben that  
ther wuzn&#x27;t anvtbing generous in the Ken  
tucky brest, he took it all back. Tbe ack­  
shen ur to-nito wuz not only just, but it  
wuz generous.  
&#x27;Generous!&quot; sed I; &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&#x27;Bcnz,&quot; sed be, the niggers wood be in  
n devilish bad way ef yoo bedn&#x27;t decided  
on givin em ther rites, uryoor own nkkord,  
for ther ain&#x27;t no power now that kin com­  
p &#x27;1 yoo to do it. I jist got a northern pa­  
per nlxs! the Republikin party is split in­  
to fragments remarkably small fragments.  
Grant assaulted Sumner in tbe I&#x27;npitol, lost  
Monday; Logan hez bin stoned by tho Re­  
publikins uv Filadelfy, on his way home;  
the Central Committees ur Ohio, Injeany  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each fncshen  
hez called a convensben; and the Noo York  
TvJlii-i rttn t .nm nr tlid. aviAMaja tas-irl IB  
.1, assets IU1 enr- UU s4VT CUUUb HUU OS-aw  
that notbin under bevin kin prevent tbe suc­  
cess uv the Dimocratio candidate for the  
Presidency, no matter nho he may be, or  
wat platform be is put onto. In view uv  
tbe disoloosben uv the Republikin party,  
and tbe fact that tho niggers ain&#x27;t now got  
no pertrcktcrs, its really generous that  
yoo &quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone tl pieces!  
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white f rends,  
in knrious.  
&quot;It hez!&quot; respnndid Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Dcekin Pogram. bis eyes  
fiashin with unwontid fire, &quot;wat we&#x27;vi done  
AND SED DO&#x27;T COCSt! TaKK THAT, TOO  
black crss!&quot;  
And with a strength nnd activity wich 1  
hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, tbe Derkin  
fecht the darkey, whose band be hed bin  
grnspin, a most powerful blow atween the  
eves, wich bisted him clean off the platform.  
The others fullered soot, and in ther xenl  
sprang off tbe platform after em, and wuz  
n cxreutin wnr-dances uv the most frantio  
deserip&#x27;hen onto ther prostrate bodies. It  
wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler  
restrained em from takin uv em out and  
hangin nv em.  
Ez a matter uv coarse, the resolnoben  
wuz rescinded, nnd others adopted, nffirmin  
our adherence to the constooshen ez it yoost  
to be, the illegality uv tbe amendments, and  
the nateral e)onVemey ov ihr whitnn  
over the d d nigger, &quot;after which we ad  
journed tn Bascom&#x27;s, ez iz our custom, and  
ther organized fre.b raids onto.our nateral  
enemies.  
The next mornin I nntise.1 a pecoolyer  
took on Bigler&#x27;s fice, nnd likewise nn Pol­  
lock&#x27;s. They grinned nt me ez I passed,  
with a hroidnis wich I cnodn&#x27;t account for.  
Luhlmck, tho nigger Postmaster, bust into  
n mar ez I walked into bis nffis, nnd I angri­  
ly demandid the reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dn mi&#x27;take oh Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned he,  
Iiughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; 1 asked, turnininpale,  
for a Huspiahun wuz crreepin over roe.  
&quot;Why, ho didn&#x27;t git no paper nt all,  
and &quot;  
&quot;And all that sory about tha split in th  
Republikin party North wuz one uv his in­  
ferml lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dit&#x27;s about dc correct state nbde case!&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin nil his ivories.  
&quot;Bigler wanted to see ef yoor pentanc  
wuz genonine dat&#x27;s about all dih wuz nh  
it. Ho &#x27;sprest n desire to assertano jist  
how peaceable yood b to de nigger nnd de  
Northern peopldown heah, ef dih wuzn&#x27;t  
no &#x27;I&#x27;utilikin party up North to hold yoo;  
dit wuz all.&quot;  
And the nigger laded a feendish laff.  
&quot;Oat wuz ill!&quot; be repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out  
all that be wanted to. Uv coirsa this &quot;out-  
vge.&quot; ez they will call it, will git into the  
Northern papers, and uv coarse Vnllandy­  
gum&#x27;s assershun will explode itself without  
hurtin anybody. Joe. Bieler is my evil  
genius. I shel&#x27;never be nbla to ran things  
ez I want to, so long ez he lives.

he had harbored a thought that thur

From the Toledy Blade.  
Coneedrit x RoAds (which is in the  
State of Kentucky), May24, 1871.-A calm  
and comprenensive survey uy the poltikle  
iald satisfierd me, some months ago, that  
without some shift in the position uv the  
Dimocrisy our hope uv success wua exceed­  
ingly thin. The resolooshens interdoost  
by Vallandygum into the Convenshun of  
the Democrisy uv Montgomery county,  
Ohio, wuz to be a new life. Troo, they  
hev the slite disadvantage uv abjobrin  
everything that is Democratic, and uv put­  
tin the Democratic party on purely Repub­  
kin ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand

Pennibacker, who hey bin languishin out  
eldo the offices ny Assessor and Collector  
are actooatid by the same high and holy  
eerlee If to do thie roculros the oro  
Impuises. E to do this tedutles the  
pyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry uv  
us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky is shoor  
to go Democratic anyhow, and if we kin  
by so simple a process ez passin resoloo-  
shens indoose enuff dissatisfied Republkins  
in tho close Northern States to vote with  
us to elect a Democratic President who will  
give us these boons, we three are for pass­  
ing these resolooshens, no matter what they  
are. This bein my understandin uv  
Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it  
to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocracy uv the Cor­  
ners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That  
I mite get em all at one time I waited till  
the regler evening for the raid on the nig­  
gers and Northern settlers up towards Gar­  
rettstown, know in that, on their return,  
they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for a drink, and  
that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in their hangin  
and burnin they&#x27;d be in good humor, and  
ready to adopt anything I shood suggest.  
It wuz a very short but a very satisfactry  
consultashen. There wuz some objickshuns  
on the part of a few to what they called an  
abandonment uv Dimocratic ideas, but  
Bascom settled their hash in very short  
metre. He remarkt that it wuz necessary  
that the offices be in the hands uv his  
friends for obvions reasons. He wanted  
pay and he knowed uv no other way to git  
it. He beleeved in the fullest freedom uv  
thought and ackshen, and that every one  
should express himself untrammeled, but  
he coodent abide a idiot. If there wus any  
one in that assemblage so stoopid ez to dif­  
fer with him on that question, let him make  
himself known. No sich man shood ever  
git a drop at his bar, never; such a one  
Wus not deservin uv even the commonest  
necessaries uv life. Several who had riz to  
their feet to object dropt as though they  
hed been shot,  
It wuz determined to hold a publle micet  
in the next nite at the church to make  
public endorsement of Vallandygum&#x27;s  
idees.  
Ez the prinsipal objict uv the meetin wur  
to convins the stepublikins uv the doubtful  
States that the Democrasy uv the South  
really accepted the situashen, and ment, in  
ded earnest, to recognize the great prinal­

## From _Sunbury American._

that our colored fellow-citizens hed bin  
despitefully yoosed, and that due respect  
had not bin alluz paid to our fellow-citizens  
uv the North, but that time hed now pass­  
ed, and I hoped forever. The Demoorisy  
uv the North, through Vallandygum, hed  
spoke, they hed accepted the situashen,  
halleloogy, and from this time henceforth  
and forever there wuz nothin but peece. I  
then offered the following resolooshen:  
&quot;Resolved, That the Dimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality uv  
all the amendments made to the Constitoo­  
shen dooring and since the late onpleasant­  
nis, and that they recognize and most hear­  
tily acquiesce in all the results uv the war;  
that they not only withdraw all their oppo­  
sishen to yooniversal suffrage, but pledge  
theirselves to see that our Afrikin fellow  
citizens hey not only this but all other rites  
heretofore enjoyed excloosively by the Cau­  
cashelt the question es to the adosphen uy  
the resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoon­  
animously. It wood hey bin well hed I  
stopped here, but I didn&#x27;t. My prevalin  
weekness is to slop over and I slopt on this  
okkasion fearfully. I called upon the citi­  
zens uv the Corners to prove their faith by  
their works. &quot;There are,&quot; I said in a spasm  
of delite, &quot;present at this meetin twenty­  
two uy our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin de­  
scent. Let em step forrerd on this plat­  
form--let Deekin Pogram, Elder Penni­  
backer, Bascom, Issaker Gavitt and eigh­  
teen other white citizens step forrerd, also.  
Let them clasp each other by the hand  
while I wave over em the flag uv our com­  
mon kontry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I was about to wave,  
when Joe. Bigler riz. He begged me to  
wait a minit till he had made his remark.  
The site before him almost moved him to  
teers. Ef he hed ever harbored a suspishen  
that there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the  
Kentucky breast he took it all back. The  
ackshun uv to-nite wuz not only just but  
it was generous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; sed he, &quot;the niggers wood be  
in a devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided  
on given em their rites, uv yoor own ak­  
kord, for there ain&#x27;t no power now that kin  
compel yoo to do it. I jist got a northern  
  
paper--alas! the Republikin party is split  
ito tiragments-remarhatbly small frag  
ments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the  
Capital last Monday, Logan hes bin stoned  
by the Republikins uv Philadelfy on his  
way home, the Central Committees uy  
Ohio, Injeany and Illinoy hev divided, and  
each frackshen hes called a convenshun,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under hevin kin  
prevent the success uv the Democratic can  
didate for the Presidency, no matter who  
he may be or wat platform he is put onto.  
In view of the dissolooshen uv the Re-  
publikin party, and the fact that the nig­  
gers ain&#x27;t now got no pertectors, its really  
generous that yoo--&quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party is gone to pieces  
hez it,&quot; gasped my twenty-two white  
friends in korious.  
&quot;It hez,&quot; responded Bioler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; said Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that you  
black cuss.&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich  
I hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Dee­  
kin fecht the darkey whos hand he hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which histed him clean off the plat  
form. The others follered suit, and in their  
zeal sprang off the platform after em, and  
waz a executin war dances uv the most  
frantic descripshen unto their prostrate  
bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock  
and Bigler restrained em from takin uv em  
out and hanging uv em.  
Ez matter uv course the resolooshen wuz  
recinded, and others adopted affirmin our  
adherence to the Constitushun ez it yoost  
to be, the illegality uv the amendments, and  
the natural soopremacy uv the white man  
over thed--- nigger, after which we  
adjourned to Bascom&#x27;s, ez is our custom,  
and there organized fresh raids onto our  
nateral enemies.  
The next mornin&#x27; I notised a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler&#x27;s facde, likewise on Pollock&#x27;s.  
They grinned at me as I passed, with a  
oroadhis that I coudn&#x27;t account for. Lub­  
bock, the nigger postmaster, bust into a  
roor ez I walked into his offis, and I an­  
grily demanded the reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned he,  
laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake?&quot; I asked, turnin pale,  
for a suspishen wuz creepin over me.  
&quot;Why, he didn&#x27;t get no paperat all, and  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the  
Republikin party North wuz one uv his in  
fernal lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case!&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin all his ivories.  
&quot;Bigler wanted to see ef yoor pentance  
Wue genooine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob  
it. He &#x27;sprest a desire to assertane jist  
how peecable yood be to de nigger and de  
Northern people down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t  
no &#x27;Publikin party up North to hold yoo  
dat wuz all.&quot;  
And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out  
all that he wanted to. Uy course this  
&quot;&#x27;outrage,&quot; as they will call it, will get into  
de Northern papers, and uv course Val­  
landygum&#x27;s assershun will explode with  
out hurting anybedy. Joc Bigler is my  
evil genius. I shel never be able to run  
things ez I want to so loug as he lives.

Xasby on the Mew Departure.  
[From the Toledo Blade ]  
Confedrit X Roads,  
(wieh iz in the State of Kentucky.)  
May 24, 1871.  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the  
politikle field satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv the  
Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedinly  
thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Yallandyghatn  
into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisy  
uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a  
new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage  
uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and  
uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin  
ground, but wat uv that ? I kin stand  
! even so sudden a change ez that! Wat 1 want  
iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger  
Lubbock out uv the postofiis at the Corners,  
and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel  
McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bio  
languishiu outside the offices uv assessor and  
collector are actooatid by the same high and  
holy impulses. Ef to Jo this requires the  
okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry  
uv us three iz &quot;okkepy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so  
simple a process ez nassin resolooshens iudoose  
enuff dissatisfied Uepublikins in the close  
Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic  
President who will give us these boons,  
we three are for passin these resolooshens no  
matter what they are. This bein my uuderstandin  
uv \ allandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid  
onto it to wunst.  
1 fi-ot the leedin D mncriav uv fKo I V.rrw?ru  
  
together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That 1 mite  
get em all at ooe time, I waited till the regler  
evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern  
settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that  
on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s for  
a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful in  
their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good  
humor and ready to adopt anything I shood  
suggest. It vruz a very short but a very satisfactry  
oonsultashen. There wuz some objiekshuns  
on the part uv a few to wat tbey called  
an abandonment uv Dimoeratic idees, but Bas  
com settled their hash in very short metre.  
He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the  
offises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius  
reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv  
no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the  
fullest freedom uv thought and ackshen, and  
that every one shood express hisself untrarameled,  
but he coodent abide a idiot. If there  
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez  
to differ with him on that question, let him  
make hisself known. No sick man shood ever  
git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz  
not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries  
uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to  
  
object dropt ez though they hed bio shot.  
It wuz determined to bold a public meetin  
the next nite at the church to make a public  
endorsement uv Yallandygum&#x27;s idees.  
Ez the prinsipal objict uv the meetin wuz to  
convins the Republikios uv the doubtful States  
that the Diinocrisy uv the South really accepted  
the situashun, and meat, in ded ernest, to recognise  
the great priosiple uv equality, I arranged  
to hev all the niggers u v the Corners present,  
and saved for thcra the best seats in the house.  
Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I  
ooodont help.  
I opened the exercises by making a short  
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the  
time hed finally arriv when the lion and the  
lamb hed laid down together, and a small child  
wuz leading uv em. 1 knowed thet our colored  
fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yooaed,  
and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid  
to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that  
time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The  
Dimucrisy uv the North, Vrallandygum, hed  
spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy,  
and from this time henceforth and forever  
there wuz to be notbin but peece. i then  
offered the follerm resoloosheu :  
&quot;Resolved, That the Diinocrisy uv the Yoouited  
States recognize the legality uv all the  
amendments made to the Constituoshen dooring  
and since the late onpleaBantnis, and that they  
recognise aud most heartily acquiesce in all the  
results uv the war ; that they not ouly withdraw  
all their opposisben to yooniversal suffrage,  
but pledge theirselves to see that our  
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but  
all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively  
by the Caucashen.&quot;  
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the  
reaolooshen, aud it wuz carried yoonanimusly.  
It wood hev bin well hed I stopped here, but I  
didn&#x27;t. My prevalin weekuess is to slop over,  
and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called  
upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their  
faith by their works. &quot;There are,&quot; 1 said, in  
a spasm of delite, &quot;present at this meetin  
twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin  
descent. Let em step forrerd on this platform  
P lmj?i&gt; :i?i? u -  
  
?ici i/ccaiu a g^raui, liiun i cuuiuftuher, i&gt;iis  
com, Issaker Guvitt, and eighteen other white  
citizens step forrerd also. Let them clasp  
each other by the hand while 1 wave over em  
the flag uv our common kontry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two uiggers stepped  
forrerd, the whites designated advanced,  
the two lines grasped each other by the hand,  
and I wuz about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize.  
Ho begged me to wait a minnit till he hed made  
hia remark. The site afore him moved him almost  
to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen  
that there wuzu&#x27;t anything generous in  
the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The  
acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz  
generons.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; sed I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be in a  
devlish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t decided on given  
them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for there  
ain&#x27;t no power now that kin compel yoo to do  
it I jist got a Northern paper?alas! the Kepublikin  
party is split into fragments?remarkably  
small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner  
in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by  
the Kepublikins uv Philadelfy on hiz way  
home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany,  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz  
called a convenshen, and the Noo York  
Triboon throws up the sponge and sez that  
notbin under the hevin Wo prevent the success  
uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency,  
no matter who he may be or wat platform be is  
put onto. In view uv the dissoloosben uv the  
Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers  
ain&#x27;t now got no perteckters, its really generous  
that yoo &quot;  
&quot; The Kepublikin party is gone to pieces!  
hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two white friends  
in korions.  
&quot; It hez 1&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot; Then,&quot; said Deo kin Pogr&amp;ui, his eyes flashin  
with unwonted fire, &quot; what we&#x27;ve dene and  
and don&#x27;t count! Take that, you black cuss ?&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the Deck in  
fecht the darkey whose hand he bed bin graspin,  
a most powerful blow atweea the eyes which  
histed him clean off the plutform, the others  
followered soot, and in their zeal sprang off the  
  
platform after em, aad wax a executia war  
dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto  
their proatrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty  
that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from  
takin uv em out and hanging uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the reaalooshen wuz  
reminded, and others adopted affirmin our ad&#x27;  
bereoce to the constitoosbatf ez it yoost to bo,  
the illegality uv the amendments, and the  
natural soopremacy uv the white man over the  
1 d?4 nigger, after wich we adjourned to Basoom&#x27;s,  
ex is our custom, and there organized  
frfih raids onto our nateral enemies  
The next morning 1 notised a pecoolyer look  
&#x27; oa Bigler&#x27;s face and likewise on Pollock&#x27;s,  
frinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis  
wich I oauldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the  
1 postmaster, bust into a roar ez 1 walked  
4nto bis offis, and I angrily demanded the rea­  
son for has hilarity.  
*&#x27; LhSl mistake ob Biglers,&#x27;* returned be,  
laughHbg loader than before.  
&quot; What mistake?&quot; 1 asked, turning pale, fo:  
a suspishen was creepin over me.  
44 Whv, he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and?&#x27;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the  
Republikiu party North wuz one uv his infer  
nalliee!&quot;  
44 Bat&#x27;s about de oorreet state ob de cess 1&quot;  
replied the nigger, showin all his ivories.

I just got a Northern paper--alas! the Repub­  
likin party is sphit into fragments--remarkably  
small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner in  
the Capitol, last Monday, Logan hez been stoned  
by the Republikins of Philadelfy on his way

most frantic descripshun onto their prostrate  
bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and  
Bigler restrained em from takin uv em out and

Ez a matter uv course the resolusion wuz re­  
scinded, and others adopted affirmin our adhe­

I couldn&#x27;t account for. Lubbock, the nigger  
postmaster, bust into a roar ez I walkt into his  
offis, and I angrily demanded the reason for his  
hilarity.  
Dat mistake ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned he  
laughing louder than before.  
What mistake,&quot; I asked, turnin pale, for a  
  
.  
.  
  
suspicion wuz creepin over me  
&quot;Why he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all, and-&quot;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in the He-  
publikan party-North wuz one uv his infernal  
lies  
Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de case!&quot;  
replied the nigger, showing all his iveries.  
&quot;Bigler wanted to see if your pentance wuz  
genooine--dat&#x27;s about all dah wuz ob it. He&#x27;  
sprest a desire to aseertane jist how peeceable  
yood be to de nigger and de Northern people  
down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no&#x27; Publican party  
up North to hold yoo; dat wuz all&quot;  
And the niggers laffed a feendish la  
Dat wuz all!&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out all  
he wanted to. Uv course this &quot; outrage,&quot; as  
they will call it, will get into the Northern pa­  
pers, and uv course Vallandygum&#x27;s asserchun  
will explode itself without hurtin anybody. Joe  
Bigler is an evil genius. I shel never be able  
two run things ez I want to so long as he lives.

CoNFeDeRIt x Roads, May 24th, 1871.  
  
A calm and comprehensive survey uv the  
polticle field, satisfied me, some months ago,  
that without some shift in the position uv the  
Dimocrisy, our hope of success was exceed  
ingly thin. The resolooshuns interdoost by  
Vallandygum into the Convenshun uv the  
Dimocrisy of Montgomery county, Ohis, was  
to me a new life. Troo, they hev the slite  
disadvantage uv abjoorin everything that is  
and uv puttin the Dimocratic I  
party on purely Republikin ground, but wati  
uv that? I kin stand even so sudden changes,  
ez that. Wat I want iz the soopreme happi­  
ness uv kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv  
the postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin my  
self in his place, and Kerne? McPelter and  
Elder Pennybacker, who have been languish-,  
in outside the offises uv Assessor and Sollector  
actooatid by the same high and holy im­  
pulses. Ef to do this requires the okkvpying  
uv Republikin ground, the war cry, uv us thre  
iz okkypy.&quot; Kentucky iz shoor to go Dimo- so  
cratic anyhow, and if we ken by so simple a  
process ez passin resolooshuns indoose enull  
disatisfied Republkins in the close  Northern  
States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic  
President who will give us these boons, we  
thre are for passin these resolushuns no mats is  
ter wat they are This bein my understanding;  
uy Vallandygum&#x27;s movement, I actid onto it  
at wonst.  
I got the leedin Dimocracy uv the Corners  
together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s. That I mite  
get em all at one time, I waited till the regler  
evenin for the raid on the niggers and north-  
ern settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin  
that on their return they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s  
for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin successful  
in their hangin and burnin they&#x27;d be in good­  
humor and ready to adopt anything I shood  
suggest. It was a very short but a very satis. f  
factory consultashen. There wuz some objeck  
shuns on the part uv a few to wat they called  
an abandonment uv Dimocratic idees, but  
Boscom settled their hash in very short me&#x27;ter.  
He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the  
offises be placed in the hands uv his friends  
for obvius reasons. He wantid pay and he  
knowd uv no other way to git it. He beleeved  
in the fullest freedom uv thought and ackshen,  
and that every one should expresse hisself  
free and untrameled, but he coodent abide a  
idiot. Ef there wuz any one in that assem-  
blage so stoopid ez to differ with him on this  
question, let him make hisself known. Nons  
ich man should ever git a drop  at his bar,   
neven; sicha one wut nof doservin ay isveniie  
the commonest inecessaries uv, life. Saveral  
tho had tiz to their teet to object, dropt on is  
though they hed bin shet.

Ir wus determined to hold a public  
meetin the next nite at the church to  
be a publin endorsement uw wallandy­  
gum&#x27;s idees.  
the prinsiple, objick ny the meetin  
wuz to convins the Republikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrats uv  
the South really acceptid the situashen,  
and meant, in dead earnest, to recognize  
the great prinsiple uv equality, I arrang.­  
d to hey all the niggers av the Corners  
present, and saved for em the best seats  
in the house. Joe Bigler and Pollock  
come, uv course, wich I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by makin a short  
peech ez I took the chair. I rejois that  
he time hed finally arriv when the lion  
and the lamb hed layed down together  
ad a small child wuz a loadin uv em. I  
knowd that our colored fellow-citizens  
hed bin dispitefully yoosed, and that doo  
respeck hed not allus bin paid to our iel  
the North, but that time  
hed now passed and I hoped forever.  
The Dimocrisy uv the North, through  
Vallandygum, hed spoke, they hed ac  
cepted the situashen, halleloogy, and  
from this time henceforth and forever  
there wuz to be nothin but peace. I  
then offered the followin resolooshen:  
Resolved, That the Dimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality  
uv all the amendments made to the Cone  
stitooshen doormn and since the late  
onpleasnis, and that they recognize and  
most heartily acquiesce in all the results  
uv the war; that they withdraw all then  
opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, but  
pledge theirselves to see that our Afriken  
fellow-citizens hey not only this but all  
other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosive­  
ly by the Cancashen.  
I put the question oz to the adopshen  
 uv the resolooshen, and it wuz carried.  
yoonanimously. It would hev bin well  
hed I stopt here, but I didn&#x27;t. My pre­  
vailin weekness iz to slop over, and I  
slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called  
upon the citizens av the Corners to  
prove their works. &#x27;There is,&#x27; I said, in  
a spasm uv delite, &#x27;resent at this meetin  
twenty-two uv our fellow-citizens uv  
Afrikin descent. Let em step forrerd on  
this platform--let Deekin Pogram, Elder  
Pennibacker, Bascom, Isaaker Gavitt,  
and eighteen other white citizens step  
forrerd, also. Let em clasp each other  
by the hand while I wave over em the  
uv our common kentry.&quot;  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stept forrerd, the whites designated ad­  
vanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and wuz about to wave,  
when Joe Bigler riz. He begged me to  
wait a minit till he hed made his remark.  
The site afore him moved him almost to  
teers. Ef he hed ever harbored a sus­  
pishen that there wuzn&#x27;t anything gener­  
ous in the Kentucky breast he took it all  
back. The ackshen uv to-nite wuz not  
only just but it wuz generous.  
&quot;Generous!&quot; said I, &quot;why generous?&quot;  
&quot;Becoz,&quot; said he, &quot;the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way ef yoo hedn&#x27;t de­  
cided on givin em their rites uv  
yoor own akkord, for there ain&#x27;t no  
power now that kin compel you to do it  
jist got a Northern paper--alas! the  
Republikin party iz split into fragments  
remarkably small fragments. Grant  
assaulted. Sumner in the Capitol last  
Monday. Logan hez bin stoned by the  
Republikins uv Philadelfy on his way  
home, the Central Committees uv Ohio,  
Injeany Illinoy hev divided, and each  
frackshen hez called a convenshun,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up  
the sponge and sez that nothin under  
hevin kin prevent the success uv the  
Dimocratic candidate for the Presidency,  
no matter who he may be or wat plat­  
form he is put onto. In view uv the  
dissolooshen av the Republikin party,  
and the fact that the niggers ain&#x27;t now  
got no perteckters, its really generous  
that yoo,-&quot;  
&quot;The Republikin party iz gone to  
pieces! hez it?&quot; gasped my twenty-two  
black friends in korious.  
&quot;It hez!&#x27; respondid Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&#x27; said Deekin P&#x27;ogram, his eyes  
dashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that,  
yoo black cuss!&quot;  
And with a strength and activity wich  
I hedn&#x27;t lookt for one so agid, the Deekin  
eteht the darky whose hand he hed bin  
graspin a most powerful blow at ween  
the eyes wich histed him clean off the  
blatform. The others follered soot, and  
a their zeal sprang off the platform after  
n, and wus a executin war dalices uv  
the most frantic descripshen onto em.

It put the question ez to theadopshen

almost tu teers. Ef he hed ever harbor­

he took it all back. The ackshen uv to­

cided on givin em their rites, uv yoor

that can compel yoo to do it. I just  
got a Northern paper alas ! the Repub­  
lisiu party is split into fragments re­  
markably small fragments. Grant as­  
saulted Sumner in the Capitol, last Mon­  
day, Logan hez been stoned by the Re­  
publikins of Philadelfy on his way home,  
the ceutral committees uv Ohio, Injeany  
and Illinoy hev divided, and each frack­  
uhen hez called a convenshen, and the  
New York Triboon throws up the sponge  
and sez that nothing under heven kin  
prevent the success uv the Democratic  
candidate for the Presidency, no matter  
who be may be or wat platform he is  
put onto. In yiew uv the dissolooshen  
uv the Republikin party, and the fact  
that the niggers ain&#x27;t now got no per­  
teckters, its really generous that yoo &quot;  
The Republikin party is gone to piec­  
es ! hez it ?&quot; graBxed my twenty -two  
white friends in korious.  
&quot;It hez I&quot; responded Bigler.  
&quot;Then,&quot; sed Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashin with unwontid fire, &quot;what we&#x27;ve  
done and sed don&#x27;t count! Take that, yoo  
black cuss !&quot; . . ;  
And, with the strength and activity  
wich I hadn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid,  
the deekin fecht the damey, whose hand  
he hed bin graspin, a most powerful  
blow atween the eyes wich histed him  
clean off the platform. The others fol­  
lowed soot, and in their zeal sprang off  
the platform after em, and wuz a execu­  
tin war dances of the most frantic des­  
cripihun onto thoir prostrate bodies. It  
wuz with difficulty that Pollock and  
Bigler restrained em from takin uv em  
out and hangin uv em.  
Ez a matter uv course the resolusion  
wuz rescinded, and others adopted affirm­  
in our adherence to the constooshen ez it  
yoost to be, the illegality uv the amend­  
ments, and the nateral soopremacy uv  
the white man over the d d nigger, aft­  
er wich we adjou-ned to Bascom&#x27;s, ex is  
our custom, and there organised fresh  
raids onto our nateral enemies. &#x27;  
The next mornin I notised a pecool­  
yer look on Bigler&#x27;s face, and likewise  
on Pollock&#x27;s. .They grinned at me ez I  
passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn&#x27;t  
account for. Lubbock, the nigger p ost­  
m aster, bust into a roar ez I walkt into  
his oflis, and I angrily demanded the  
reason for his hilarity.  
&quot;Dat mistake of ob Bigler&#x27;s,&quot; returned  
he, laughing louder than before.  
&quot;What mistake,&quot; I asked, turning  
pale, for a suspicion wuz creepin. over  
me.  
&quot;Why he didn&#x27;t get no paper at all,  
and&#x27;  
&quot;And all that story about the split in  
the republikin party North wuz one uv  
his infernal lies!&quot;  
&quot;Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de  
case !&quot; replied the nigger, showing all  
his iveries. &quot;Bigler wanted to see if  
yourpretauce wuzgenooine dat&#x27;sabout  
all dah wuz ob it. He&#x27; sprest a desire  
to aseertane jist how peeceable yood be  
to de nigger and de Northern people  
down heah, ef dah wuzn&#x27;t no&#x27; Publican  
party up North to hold yoo ; dat wus  
all.&quot;  
And the niggers laffed a feendish laff.  
&quot;Dat wuz all !&quot; he repeated.  
It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found  
out all he wanted to. Uv course this  
&quot;outrage,&quot; as they will call it, will get  
into the Northern papers, and course  
Vallandygum&#x27;s asserchun will explode  
itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Big.  
ler is an avil genius. I shel never be  
able two run things ez I want to so long  
as be lives.

a new life. Troo, they hev the slite dis­  
advantange uv abjoorio everything that  
is Democratic, afid uv puttin the Dem­  
cratic party on purely Republikiu grouud,  
but what uv that ? I kin st tud even so

Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin

the okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the  
war cry uv us three is &quot;okkepy.&quot; Ken­  
tucky is shoor to go Democrilic anyhow,  
aud if we kin by so simple a process ez

States to vote with us to elect a Demo­  
cratic President who will give us these  
boous, we three are for passing these  
resolooshens, no matter what tbey are.  
This bein my understands uv Vallan­  
dygum&#x27;s movement, I acted onto it to J  
  
wunst.  
I got the leedin Diuocracy uv the  
Corners together one nite at Bascom&#x27;s.  
That I mite get em all at one time, I  
waited till the regler eveuing for the raid  
on the niggers and Northern settlers up  
towards Garrelstown, knowin that, on  
I their return, they&#x27;d all stop at Bascom&#x27;s  
for a drink, and that ef they&#x27;d bin suc-  
cessful in their hangin and burniu they&#x27;d  
be in good humor, and ready to adopt  
anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very  
short but salUfactry coLsultasheu. There  
wuz some objickshums on the part of a  
few to what they called an abandonment  
uv Diuiocratic ideas, but Bascom settled  
their hash in very short metre. He re­  
mark that it wuz necessary that the of­  
fice be in the hands uv his friends lor ob­  
vious reasons. He wanted pay and he  
knowed uv no other way to git it. He  
beleeved in the fullest freedom uv thought  
and ackshen, and that every one should  
  
express himself untrampled, but helyoost to be, the iltegility uv the athendJ  
  
coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any  
one iu that assemblage so stoopid ez to  
differ with him on that question, let him  
make himself known. No sicb man  
shood ever git a drop at his bar, never ;  
such a one wuz not deservin uv even the

I opened the exercises by makin a

together, aud a child wuz the lead in uv  
I knowed our colored fellow-citi- j  
em  
zeus hed bin despiteful! y voosed. and  
and that due respect had not bin aliuz  
paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North,,  
but that time bed now passed, and  
hoped forever. The Democrlsy uv the  
North, through Vallandygum, hed spbk,  
they bed accepted tbe situashen, balle­  
loogy, and from this time henceforth and  
forever there wuz nothin but peece t

nv the war ; that they not only with  
draw all thetr opposishen to yoouiversal

that our Afrikio fellow-citizens hev notj  
only this but all other rites heretofore  
enjoyed excloosively by the Caacashen.&quot;  
I put the question ez to the adopshen  
dv the resolooshens, it wnz carried yoo­  
nanimously. It would hew bid well hed  
I stopped here, - but I didn&#x27;t. My , pre-  
valin weekness is to slop over and I  
slopt on this okkasion fearfully.&#x27; I call­  
ed upon the citizens uv&quot; the Corners . to  
prove their faith by their works. &quot;There  
are, I saio in a spasm of delite, . &quot;pres­

It wuz done. The twenty-two nig­  
gers stepped forred, the whites designa­  
ted advanced, and two liiee graspacT each&#x27;  
other by the hand, and 1. was about to  
wave, when Joe BigleT riz.. He begged!  
me to wait a mfnit till he bal made his  
remark. The site : before, bini almost  
movd him to teers. KF he bed ever

harbored a euspishen that there wuzut  
anything generous in the Kentucky breasf

And with a strength and activity with  
I bedn&#x27;t lookt for in one so agid, the  
Deekin frelit the darkey whose band he  
bed b&#x27;n grsispin a most powerful blow  
atween the eyes, which hie ted him clean  
off the platform. The others follered

Confedrit X Roads (which is iu the Stait  
of Keutnck,) May 24, 1871.—A calm and  
comprehensive survey uv the politiklo field  
satisfied me, some months ago, that with­  
out some shift in the position uv the Dim  
ocrisy our hope of success wuz exceedingly  
thin. The resoloosheus introdoost by Val­  
landygum into the Convcnshun uv the  
Dimocrisy uv Montgomery county, Ohio,  
wuz to he a new life. Troo, they have the  
slite disadvantage uv abjooriug everything  
that is Dimocratic, and uv putting the  
Diraocratic party on purely Repuhlikan  
ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand  
even so sudden a change ez that. What I  
want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin  
that nigger Lubbock out uv the post offiis  
at tho Corners and uv putlin myself in his  
place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pen­  
uipaker, who hev been languishin outside  
uv tho offis ov Assessor aud Collector are  
actooated by the same high and holy  
impulses. Ef to do this requires the okko­  
pyin uv Bepublikiu ground, the war cry uv  
us three iz “okkepy.” Kentucky is shoor  
to go Dimocratic anyhow, and ef wo kin  
by so simple a process ez passin resoloo­  
shuns indooso enuff dissatisfied Republi­  
kins in the close Northern States to rote  
with us to elect a Dimocratic President,  
who will give us these boons, wo three are  
for passin these resoloosheus, no matter  
what they arc. This being my understandin  
uv Vallandygum’s movement, I acted onto  
it to wunst.  
I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Cor­  
ners together one night at Bascom’s. That  
I might get em all at one time, I waited  
till the roglcr evening for the raid on the  
niggers and Northern settlers up towards  
Garrettstown, knowin that on their return,  
they’d all stop at Bascora&#x27;s for a drink,  
and that if they&#x27;d been successful in their  
hangin and burnin they’d he in a good  
humor, and ready to adopt anything I  
should sugge st. It wuz a very short but a  
very satisfaciry consultashcn. There wuz  
some objeckshuns on the part uv a few to  
what they called an abandonment uv Dim­  
ocratic idocs, hut Bascom settled their bash  
in very short metre. He remarkt that it  
wuz necessary that tho offisis bo in the  
hands uv hi - friends for obvious reezons.  
He wanted ,&gt; iy, and he know&#x27;d of no other  
way to git it. He belseved in the fullest  
freedom uv thought and ackshen, and that  
every one should express himself uutram­  
eled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If thdre  
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid  
as to differ with him on that question, let  
him make himself known. No sich man  
shood ever git a drop at his bar, never ;  
such a one wuz not deservin uv even the  
common necessaries of life. Several who  
had risen to their teet to object, dropt as  
though they had been shot.  
It wuz determined to hold a public meetin  
the next night at the Church to make a  
public endorsement of Vallaudygum’s idees  
Ez the prinsipal object uv tho meetin  
wuz to convins the Rcpuhlikins uv the  
doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the  
South really accepted the situashen, and  
meat in ded earnest to recognize tho great  
prinsipal of equality, I arranged to hev all  
the niggers uv the Corners present and  
save for em the best seats in tho house.—  
Joe Bigler ami Pollock cum uv course,  
which I coodent help.  
I opened the exercises by makin a short  
speech cz I took the chair. I rejoist that  
the time hed finally arrived when the lion  
and tho lamb hed layed down together, and  
a child wuz a leedin uv them. I knowd  
that our colored fellow-citizens lied been  
Jispitefully yoosed, and that due respect  
had not been alluz paid to our fellow-citi­  
zens uv the North, hut that time had now  
passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimoc­  
risy uv the North through Vallandygum  
hed spoke; they hed accepted the situa­  
shen; halleloogy, and from this time hence­  
forth and forever there wuz nothin hut pecce  
I then offered the following resolooshen :  
llenolred, That tho Dimocrisy uv the  
Yoonited States recognize the legality of all  
the amendments to the constitooshen door­  
ing and since the late onpleasantniss, and  
that they recognize and most heartily  
acquiesce in all the results uv the war;  
that they not only withdraw all their oppo­  
sition to yooniversal snfferage, hut pledge  
theirsclves to see that our African fellow­  
citizeus hev not only this hut all the rites  
heretofore enjoyed exclusively by the Cau­  
cashen.  
1 put tho question as to the adoption of  
the resolooshcn, and it wuz carried yoonan­  
imously. It wood hev been well hed I  
stopi&gt;od here, hut I didn&#x27;t. My prevailin  
weakness is to slop over, and I slopt on  
this okkashen fearfully. I called upon the  
citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith  
by their works. “ There are,” I said, in a  
spasm of delight, “ present at this meetin

kin descent. Let era step forred on this  
platform—let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pen­  
nibacker, Bascom, Isakeor Gavitt and eigh­  
teen other white citizens step forred, also.  
Let them clasp each other by the hand  
while I ware over them the flag of our  
common kontry.”  
It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers  
stepped forred, the whites designated  
advanced, the two lines grasped each other  
by the hand, and I was about to ware when  
Joe Bigler riz. lie begged me to wait a  
minit till he had made his remark. The  
site before him almost moved him to tears.  
Ef ho hed ever harbored a suspishen that  
there wuzn&#x27;t anything generous in the Ken­  
tucky breast, he took it all back. The  
aeshun uv to nito wuz not only Just but it  
wuz generous.  
“Generous!” said I, “whygenerous?”  
“ Becoz,” said lie, “ the niggers wood be  
in a devilish bad way ef you hedn’t deci­  
ded on given era their rites uv your own  
akkord, for there ain&#x27;t no power now that  
can compel you to doit. Ijist got a North­  
ern paper—alas ! the Rcpuhlikin party is  
split into fragments, remarkably small  
fragments. Grant assaulied Sumner in the  
Capitol last Monday; Logan has been  
stoned by the Rcpuhlikins uv Philadelfy  
on his way home ; the Central Committees  
of Ohio, Injeany and Illinois hev divided,  
and each fraeshen has called a convcnshun,  
and the Noo York Triboon throws up the  
sponge and sez that nothin under hevin kin  
prevent the success uv the Dimikratic can­  
didate for the Presidency, no matter who  
he may be or wot platform he is put onto.  
In view of the dissolooshcn uv the Repub­  
likin party, and the fact that the niggers  
ain’t now got no protectors, its really gen­  
erous that yoo ”  
“ The Republikin party is gone to pieces,  
hez it?” gasped my twenty-two white  
friends in korious.  
“ It hez,” responded Bigler.  
“Then,” said Deekin Pogram, his eyes  
flashing with unwontid fire, “what we’ve  
done and sed don’t count 1 Take that, you  
black cuss.”  
And with a strength and activity wich I  
hedn’t lookt for in one so agid, tho Deekin  
fecht the darkey whose hand he had been  
graspin, a most powerful blow atween the  
eyes, which histed him clean off the plat­  
form. The others followed suit, aud in  
their zeal sprung off the platform after era,  
aud wuz a cxecutin war dances uv the most  
frantic descripshen unto their prostrate  
bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock  
and Bigler restrained em from taken uv em  
out and hangin uv em.  
Ez matter uv course the resolooshcn wuz  
recinded, and others adopted affirrain our  
adherence to the Constitution ez it yoost  
to be, the illegality uv the amendments,  
and the natural soopremacy uv the white  
man over the d—d uigger, after which wo  
adjourned to Bascom’s, ez is our custom,  
and there organized fresh raids onto our  
natural enemies.  
The next moruiu I noticed a pecoolyer  
look on Bigler’s face, likewise on Pollock’s.  
They grinned at me as I passed with a  
broadnis I coodent account for. Lubbock,  
the nigger postmaster, bust into a roor as I  
walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded  
the reason of his hilarity.  
“ Dat mistake oh Bigler’s,” returned he,  
laughing louder than before.  
“ What mistake ?” I asked, turning pale,  
for suspicion was creepin over me.  
“ Why, he didn’t get no paper at all,  
and—”  
“ And all that story about the split iu  
the Rcpublikin party North wuz one uv his  
infernal lies?”  
“ Dat&#x27;s about de correct state ob de  
&#x27;case 1” replied the nigger, showing his  
ivories.  
“ Bigler wanted too see ef your pentance  
wuz genooine—dat’s all dah wuz ob it.—  
He ’sprest desire to assortane jist how  
peccable yood be to do nigger and do  
Northern people down heah, ef da wuzn&#x27;t  
Publikin party up North to hold yoo ; dat  
wuz all.”  
And the nigger laffed a fiendish laff.  
That wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found  
out all he wanted to. Uv coorse this  
“outrage” as they will call it, will git into  
the Northern papers, and uv coorse Vallan­  
dygum’s assershun will explode without  
hurting anybody. Joe Bigler is my evil  
genius. I shel never be able to run things  
ez I want to so long ez he lives.
