Women&#x27;s Veneration  
BY MRS. STOWE  
  
If women have one weakness more marked than another, it is towards veneration. They are born worshippers,—makers of silver shrines for some divinity or other, which, of course, they always think fell straight down from heaven. The first step towards their falling in love with an ordinary mortal is generally to dress him out with all manner of real or fancied superiority; and having made him up, they worship him. Now a truly great man, a man really grand and noble in heart and intellect, has this advantage with women, that he is an idol ready-made to hand; and so that very painstaking and ingenious sex have less labor in getting him up, and can be ready to worship him on shorter notice. In particular is this the case where a sacred profession and a moral supremacy are added to the intellectual. Just think of the career of celebrated preachers and divines in all ages. Have they not stood like the image that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar the king set up,&quot; and all womankind, coquettes and flirts not excepted, been ready to fall down and worship, even before the sound of cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, and so forth? Is not the faithful Paula, with her beautiful face, prostrate in reverence before poor, old, lean, haggard, dying St. Jerome, in the most splendid painting of the world, an emblem and sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power of self-sacrifice to what she deems noblest in man? Does not old Richard Baxter tell us, with delightful single-heartedness, how his wife fell in love with him first, spite of his long, pale face,—and how she confessed, dear soul, after many years of married life, that she had found him less sour and bitter than she had expected? The fact is, women are burdened with fealty faith, reverence, more than they know what to do with; they stand like a hedge of sweet-peas, throwing out fluttering tendrils everywhere for something high and strong to climb by,—and when they find it, be it ever so rough in the bark, they catch upon it. And instances are not wanting of those who have turned away from the flattery of admirers to prostrate themselves at the feet of a genuine hero who never wooed them, except by heroic deeds and the rhetoric of a noble life.

Woman&#x27;s Veneration.  
If women have one weakness more  
marked than man, it is toward veneration.  
They are born worshippers—makers of  
silver shines for some divinity or other,  
whom, of course they always think fell  
strait down from heaven. The first step to­  
wards their falling in love with an ordinary  
mortal is generally to dress him out with  
all manner of real or fanciui superiority—

has this advantage with women, that he is  
an idol ready made to hand and so that  
very painstaking and ingenious sex have  
less labor in getting him up, and can be  
ready to worship him on shorter notice.—  
In particular is this the case where a sacred  
profession and a mortal supremacy are ad­  
ded toe intellectual. Just think of the  
career of celebrated preachers and divines  
in all agas. Have they not stood like the  
image that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar the King set  
up,&quot; and all women kind, coquettes and  
flirts not excepted, have been ready to fall  
down and worship, even before the sound  
of coronet, flute, harp, sackbut, and so  
forth. Is not the faithful Paula, with beauti­  
ful face, prostrate in reverence before poor,  
old, lean, haggard, dying St. Jerome, the  
most splendid painting in the emblem and  
a sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power, of self­  
sacrifice to what she deems noblest in man

lar is this the&#x27; case where a- sacred pro  
fession and a moral supremacy are added  
to the intellectual. Just think of the ca

Is not the faithful Paula, with her beau  
tiful face, prostrate before poor old, lean,  
haggard, dying St. Jerome, in the most

more thau they know what to do with ;  
they stand like a hedge of sweet peas,

If women have one weakness more  
marked than meu, it is toward vener  
ation. They are lorn worshippers  
makers of silver shrines for some di  
vinity or other, which of course they  
always think fell straight down Irani

a man re all)&#x27; grand and noble in art  
and intellect, has this advantage with  
women, that he is an idol ready made  
to hand, so that very painstaking and  
ingenious sex have less lahor in get­  
ting him up, and can l.e ready to  
worship him on shorter notiee. In  
particular is this the a-e where a as.  
ored profession and a moral suprem­  
acy are added toathe intellectual. Jutt  
think of the career of the celebrated  
preachers and divines in all ages.  
Have they not stood like the images  
&quot;Nebuchadnezzar, the king, setup ;&quot;  
and all womankind, coquettes and

down and worship, even Itefore the

long, pale face ; and how she con­  
fessed, dear soul, after masy years of  
married life, that she bad found him  
4ess bitter and sour than she expect

pease throwing out tendrils every  
where for something high and strong

are not wanting of those who have  
turned away from the flattery of ad  
mirers to prostrate themselves at the

them except by heroic deeds and the
