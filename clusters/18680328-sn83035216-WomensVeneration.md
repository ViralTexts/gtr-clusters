Women&#x27;s Veneration  
BY MRS. STOWE  
  
If women have one weakness more marked than another, it is towards veneration. They are born worshippers,—makers of silver shrines for some divinity or other, which, of course, they always think fell straight down from heaven. The first step towards their falling in love with an ordinary mortal is generally to dress him out with all manner of real or fancied superiority; and having made him up, they worship him. Now a truly great man, a man really grand and noble in heart and intellect, has this advantage with women, that he is an idol ready-made to hand; and so that very painstaking and ingenious sex have less labor in getting him up, and can be ready to worship him on shorter notice. In particular is this the case where a sacred profession and a moral supremacy are added to the intellectual. Just think of the career of celebrated preachers and divines in all ages. Have they not stood like the image that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar the king set up,&quot; and all womankind, coquettes and flirts not excepted, been ready to fall down and worship, even before the sound of cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, and so forth? Is not the faithful Paula, with her beautiful face, prostrate in reverence before poor, old, lean, haggard, dying St. Jerome, in the most splendid painting of the world, an emblem and sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power of self-sacrifice to what she deems noblest in man? Does not old Richard Baxter tell us, with delightful single-heartedness, how his wife fell in love with him first, spite of his long, pale face,—and how she confessed, dear soul, after many years of married life, that she had found him less sour and bitter than she had expected? The fact is, women are burdened with fealty faith, reverence, more than they know what to do with; they stand like a hedge of sweet-peas, throwing out fluttering tendrils everywhere for something high and strong to climb by,—and when they find it, be it ever so rough in the bark, they catch upon it. And instances are not wanting of those who have turned away from the flattery of admirers to prostrate themselves at the feet of a genuine hero who never wooed them, except by heroic deeds and the rhetoric of a noble life.

The child would never eat rice again; ho could  
not do it, and his mind was troubled. For a tran­  
sient pleasure, lie bad bound himself by a promise  
which he could not fulfil.  
These are grave mistakes, however trifling  
each occasion may appear. The whole subject  
of eating is made of far too much importance by  
thus connecting it with so much thought and emo­

worshippers—makers of silver shrines for some  
divinity or other, which, of course, they always  
think fell straight down from heaven. The first

that he is an idol ready made to hand; and so  
that very pains-taking and ingenious sex have  
less labor in getting him up, and can be ready to  
worship him on shorter notice. In particular is  
this the case where a sacred profession and a  
moi al supremacy are added to the intellectual.  
Just think of the career of celebrated preachers  
and divines in all ages. Have they not stood like  
the image that “Nebuchadnezzar tho King, set  
up,” and all woman kind, coquettes and flirts not  
excepted, been ready to fall down and worship,  
even before the soundof cornet, flute, harp,sack­  
but, and so forth ? Is not the faithful Paula, with  
her beautiful face, prostrate in reverence before  
poor, old, lean, haggard, dying St. Jerome, in tho  
most splendid painting of the world, an emblem  
and a sign of woman’s eternal power of self-sac­  
rifice to what she deems noblest in man. Does  
not old Richard Baxter tell ns, with delightful sin­  
gle-heartedness, how his wife fell in love with him  
first, spite of his long pale face, and how she con­  
fessed, dear soul, after many years of marriedlife,  
that she had found him less sour and bitter than  
she had expected? The fact is, women are bur­  
dened with fealty, faith, reverence, more than  
they know what to do with; they stand like a  
hedge of sweet peas, throwing out fluttering ten­  
drils everywhere for something high and strong  
to climb up by, and when they find it, be it ever  
so rough in the bark, they catch upon it. And

out with all manner of real or fancied su­

that he is an idol ready made to hand; and  
so that pains Jaking and ingenious sex  
have less labor in getting him up, and car  
be ready to worship him on a hrtr no­  
tice. Particularily this is the ch-j where  
a sacred profession and a moral supremacy  
are added to the intellectual ! Just think

womankind, coquetts and flirts not excep­  
ted, been ready to fall down and worship,  
even before the sound of cornet, flute, harp  
sackbuth, and so forth. Is not the faith­  
ful Paula, with her beautiful face, pros­  
trate in reverence, be lore poor, old, lean,  
haggard, dying St. Jerome, in the most  
splendid painting of the world, an emblem  
and a sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power of,  
self sacrifice to what she deems noblest in  
man? Does not old Richard Baxter tell  
us, with delightful single tenderness, how  
his wife fell in love with him first, in ppite  
of hia long pale face; and so she confessed,  
dear soul, after many years of married life  
that she had found him less sour and bit­

men are burdened with fealty, faith, reve­

From the Wooing.  
  
Woman&#x27;s Yeneration.  
If women have one weakness more  
marked than man, it is toward vonerationv  
They are born worshippers—makers of  
silver shrines for some divinity or other,  
whom, of course they always think fell  
strait down from heaven. The first step  
towards  
  
f.heir  
  
nary mortal is generally to dress him out  
with all manner of real fancicd superior!&quot;  
ty and, having made him up, tlicy wcMfi  
ship him. Now, a truly great gent lorn aa#&#x27;  
a man really grand and noble in art and  
intellect, has this ndvantago with women,  
that he is^an idol ready made to hand  
and so that very pains-taking and ingen­  
ious sex have less labor in getting himup^  
and can be ready to worship hiin on short  
notice. In particular is this the cat#  
where a sacred profession and mortal su­  
premacy are added to intellect. Just  
think of tho career of celebrated preach­  
ers and divines in all ages. Ilaro they  
not stood like tho image that &quot;Nebuchal*»  
nezznr the King set up,&quot; and all womail  
kind, coquettes and flirts not excepted  
have been ready to fall down and worship^  
even before the sound of coronet, fluti/  
harp, sackbut, and so forth. Is not tW  
faithful Paula, with beautiful face, pros*  
trate in reverence before poor, old, lean,  
haggard, dying St. Jerome, the most  
splendid painting in the emblem and a  
sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power, of self­  
sacrifice to what she deems noblest  
tnan Does not old Richard Baxter tell  
us, with delightful single-heartednes||*  
how his wife fell in love with him firs^&#x27;  
spite of his long pale face and how sb«*  
confessed, dear soul, after many years of  
married life, that she found him less sour  
and bitter than she had expected 1 The  
the fact is, women are burdened with feal­  
ity, faith, reverence, more than they know  
what to do with they stand like a hedge  
of sweet peas, throwing out fluttering ten­  
drils everywhere for something high and  
strong to climb up by, and when they find  
it, be it ever so rough in the bark, they  
catch upon it. And instances are no?  
wanting of those who have turned away  
from the flattery of admirers to prostrat®  
themselves at the feet of a genuine hero&#x27;  
who never wooed them except by heroic  
deeds aud the rhetoric of a noble life.
