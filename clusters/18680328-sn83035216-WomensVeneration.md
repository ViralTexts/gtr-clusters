Women&#x27;s Veneration  
BY MRS. STOWE  
  
If women have one weakness more marked than another, it is towards veneration. They are born worshippers,—makers of silver shrines for some divinity or other, which, of course, they always think fell straight down from heaven. The first step towards their falling in love with an ordinary mortal is generally to dress him out with all manner of real or fancied superiority; and having made him up, they worship him. Now a truly great man, a man really grand and noble in heart and intellect, has this advantage with women, that he is an idol ready-made to hand; and so that very painstaking and ingenious sex have less labor in getting him up, and can be ready to worship him on shorter notice. In particular is this the case where a sacred profession and a moral supremacy are added to the intellectual. Just think of the career of celebrated preachers and divines in all ages. Have they not stood like the image that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar the king set up,&quot; and all womankind, coquettes and flirts not excepted, been ready to fall down and worship, even before the sound of cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, and so forth? Is not the faithful Paula, with her beautiful face, prostrate in reverence before poor, old, lean, haggard, dying St. Jerome, in the most splendid painting of the world, an emblem and sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power of self-sacrifice to what she deems noblest in man? Does not old Richard Baxter tell us, with delightful single-heartedness, how his wife fell in love with him first, spite of his long, pale face,—and how she confessed, dear soul, after many years of married life, that she had found him less sour and bitter than she had expected? The fact is, women are burdened with fealty faith, reverence, more than they know what to do with; they stand like a hedge of sweet-peas, throwing out fluttering tendrils everywhere for something high and strong to climb by,—and when they find it, be it ever so rough in the bark, they catch upon it. And instances are not wanting of those who have turned away from the flattery of admirers to prostrate themselves at the feet of a genuine hero who never wooed them, except by heroic deeds and the rhetoric of a noble life.

Woman&#x27;s Veneration.?If women Lave one  
weakness more marked than man, it is toward?  
veneration. They are born, worshippers?  
makers of silver sliriues in some divinity or­  
other, which of course they always think fell&#x27; \
  
.-traight down from heaven. The first steptowards  
tiieir tailing in love with an ordinary &lt;  
mortal is generally to dress him out with all  
manner oi real or fancied superiority; and  
having made him up, they worship him&quot;. Now,  
a truly great man, a man really grand- rind  
nohle in art and intellect, has this advantage  
with women, that he is au idol ready made to  
hand; and so that very painstaking and ingenious  
sex have less labor in getting him upr  
and can he ready to worship him on shorter  
notice. In particular is this the case where ?  
sacred profession and a moral supremacy are  
added to the intellectual. Just think of the&#x27;  
career&#x27;of celebrated preachers and divines in  
all ages.?Have they.not stood like the image

before poor, old lean,haggard, dying St. Jerome,  
in the most splendid painting of the world, au  
ehiblem and a sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power  
of self-sacrifice to what she deems noblest in J  
man ? Docs not old Richard Baxter tells us M  
with diligbtful single heartedness; how his

From the Wooing.  
  
Woman&#x27;s Yeneration.  
If women have one weakness more  
marked than man, it is toward vonerationv  
They are born worshippers—makers of  
silver shrines for some divinity or other,  
whom, of course they always think fell  
strait down from heaven. The first step  
towards  
  
f.heir  
  
nary mortal is generally to dress him out  
with all manner of real fancicd superior!&quot;  
ty and, having made him up, tlicy wcMfi  
ship him. Now, a truly great gent lorn aa#&#x27;  
a man really grand and noble in art and  
intellect, has this ndvantago with women,  
that he is^an idol ready made to hand  
and so that very pains-taking and ingen­  
ious sex have less labor in getting himup^  
and can be ready to worship hiin on short  
notice. In particular is this the cat#  
where a sacred profession and mortal su­  
premacy are added to intellect. Just  
think of tho career of celebrated preach­  
ers and divines in all ages. Ilaro they  
not stood like tho image that &quot;Nebuchal*»  
nezznr the King set up,&quot; and all womail  
kind, coquettes and flirts not excepted  
have been ready to fall down and worship^  
even before the sound of coronet, fluti/  
harp, sackbut, and so forth. Is not tW  
faithful Paula, with beautiful face, pros*  
trate in reverence before poor, old, lean,  
haggard, dying St. Jerome, the most  
splendid painting in the emblem and a  
sign of woman&#x27;s eternal power, of self­  
sacrifice to what she deems noblest  
tnan Does not old Richard Baxter tell  
us, with delightful single-heartednes||*  
how his wife fell in love with him firs^&#x27;  
spite of his long pale face and how sb«*  
confessed, dear soul, after many years of  
married life, that she found him less sour  
and bitter than she had expected 1 The  
the fact is, women are burdened with feal­  
ity, faith, reverence, more than they know  
what to do with they stand like a hedge  
of sweet peas, throwing out fluttering ten­  
drils everywhere for something high and  
strong to climb up by, and when they find  
it, be it ever so rough in the bark, they  
catch upon it. And instances are no?  
wanting of those who have turned away  
from the flattery of admirers to prostrat®  
themselves at the feet of a genuine hero&#x27;  
who never wooed them except by heroic  
deeds aud the rhetoric of a noble life.
