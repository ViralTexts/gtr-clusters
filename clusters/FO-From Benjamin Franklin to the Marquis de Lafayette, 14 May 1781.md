Price of his Treason may be nearly guess’d at. Judas sold only one Man, Arnold three Millions; Judas got for his one Man 30 Pieces of Silver, Arnold not a halfpenny a Head. A miserable Bargainer: Especially when one considers the Quantity of Infamy he has acquir’d to himself, &amp; entail’d on his Family.  
The English are in a fair way of gaining still more Enemies: They play a desperate Game.

Lafayette, said : “Judas sold only one man; Arnold three  
millions. Judas got for his one man thirty pieces of silver ;  
Arnold, not a halfpenny a-head. A miserable bargain !  
especially when one considers the quantity of infamy he  
has acquired to himself and entailed on his family.”  
Arnold&#x27;s new biographer endeavours to palliate his guilt,  
pleading his brilliant earlier services in extenuation of his  
stupendous crime.
