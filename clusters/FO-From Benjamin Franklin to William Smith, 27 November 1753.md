Dear Sir,  
Philada. Nov. 27. 1753  
Having wrote you fully via Bristol, I have now little to add. Matters relating to the Academy remain in Statu quo. A Majority of the Trustees, I find, would be glad to see a Rector establish’d there, but they dread entring into new Engagements ’till they are got out of Debt; and I have not yet been able to bring them over to my Opinion, that a good Professor and Teacher of the higher Branches of Learning, would draw so many Scholars as to pay great Part if not the whole of his Salary. Thus, unless the Proprietors shall think fit to put the finishing Hand to our Institution, it must, I fear, wait some few Years longer before it can arrive at that State of Perfection which to me it seems now to be capable of; and all the Pleasure I promis’d myself in seeing you settled among us, vanishes into Smoke. But good Mr. Collinson writes me Word, that no Endeavour of his shall be wanting, and he hopes with the Archbishop’s Assistance to be able to prevail with our Proprietors. I pray God grant them Success.  
My Son presents his affectionate Regards with, Dear Sir, Your most humble Servant  
B Franklin  
I have not yet been favour’d with a Line

Dear Sir,  
  
HAVING written you fully, oa  
Briftol, | have now little to add. Mat-  
ters relating tothe Academy remain  
in flatu quo. The truftees would  
be glad to fee a Rector eftablithed  
there, but they dread entering in-  
to new engagements, till they are  
got out of debt; and I have not yer  
got them wholly over to my opini-  
on, that a good profeffor or teach-  
er of the higher branches of learn-  
ing, would draw fo many {cholars  
as to pay great part, if not the  
whole of his falary. Thus, unlefs  
the proprietors (of the province)  
fhall ‘think fit to put the finifhing  
hand to our inftitution, it mutt, I  
fear, wait fome few years longer,  
before it can arrive at that ftate of  
perfection, which to me it feems  
now capable of ; and all the plea-  
fure I promifed myfelf in feeing  
you {ettled among us, vanifhes into
