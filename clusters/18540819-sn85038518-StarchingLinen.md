STARCHING LINEN.—To those who desire to impart to shirt bosoms, collars, and other fabrics that fine and beautiful gloss observable on new linens, the following recipe for making gum arabic starch will be most acceptable, and should have a place in the domestic scrap-book of every woman who prides herself upon her capacity as a housewife and the neatness of her own, her husband&#x27;s, and family&#x27;s dress; and if she does not take pride in these things, her husband is an unfortunate man:  
  
&quot;Take two ounces of fine white gum arabic powder, put it into a pitcher, and pour on it a pint or more of boiling water (according to the degree of strength you desire,) and then, having covered it, let it set all night. In the morning pour it carefully from the dregs into a clean bottle, cork it, and keep it for use. A tablespoonful of gum water stirred into a pint of starch that has been made in the usual manner will give the lawns (either white, black, or printed) a look of newness to when nothing else can restore them after washing. It is also good, much diluted, for thin white muslin and bobinet.—*Augusta Chronicle*.

GLOSSING OF LINEN.  
j ; -To those who desire to impart to  
shirt-! fronts, collars, and other  
fabrics, that line and ■ beautiful gloss  
observable 011 new linens, the following  
recipe for making gum arabic st&#x27;irch  
will be most acceptable, and should^&#x27;  
have a place in the domestic scrap book  
of every woman who prides herself upon  
her capacity as housewife, and the  
neatness of her own and her family&#x27;s  
dress ; and if shd does not take pride  
in (hem, the husband is an unfortunate  
man :—Take two ounces cf white gum  
arabic powder, put it into a pitcher,  
and pour in it a pint or more of boiling  
water (according to the degree of  
strength you desire), and then, having  
covered it, let it set all j iiight. In  
the morning, pour it carefully from the  
dregs into a clean botile, cork it, and  
keep it for use. A tablespoonful of gum  
water stirred into a pint of starch that  
has ! been made in the usual manner,  
v.&#x27;ill give the lawns (either  
white.-black, or printed) a look i of  
newness, when nothing else can restore  
them after washing. It is also good,  
much diluted, for thin white muslin and  
bobbinet.
