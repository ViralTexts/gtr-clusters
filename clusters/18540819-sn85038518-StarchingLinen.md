STARCHING LINEN.—To those who desire to impart to shirt bosoms, collars, and other fabrics that fine and beautiful gloss observable on new linens, the following recipe for making gum arabic starch will be most acceptable, and should have a place in the domestic scrap-book of every woman who prides herself upon her capacity as a housewife and the neatness of her own, her husband&#x27;s, and family&#x27;s dress; and if she does not take pride in these things, her husband is an unfortunate man:  
  
&quot;Take two ounces of fine white gum arabic powder, put it into a pitcher, and pour on it a pint or more of boiling water (according to the degree of strength you desire,) and then, having covered it, let it set all night. In the morning pour it carefully from the dregs into a clean bottle, cork it, and keep it for use. A tablespoonful of gum water stirred into a pint of starch that has been made in the usual manner will give the lawns (either white, black, or printed) a look of newness to when nothing else can restore them after washing. It is also good, much diluted, for thin white muslin and bobinet.—*Augusta Chronicle*.
