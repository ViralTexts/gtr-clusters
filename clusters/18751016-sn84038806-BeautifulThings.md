Beautiful faces are those that wear,  
It matters little if dark or fair—    
Whole-souled honestly printed there.  
  
Beautiful eyes are those that show,  
Like crystal panes where hearth fires glow,  
Beautiful thoughts that burn below.  
  
Beautiful lips are those whose words  
Leap from the heart like songs of birds,  
Yet whose utterance prudence girds.  
  
Beautiful hands are those that do  
Work that is earnest and brave and true,  
Moment by moment the long day through.  
  
Beautiful feet are those that go  
On kindly ministries to and fro—  
Down lowest ways, if God wills it so.  
  
Beautiful shoulders are those that bear  
Ceaseless burdens of homely care  
With patient grace and daily prayer.  
  
Beautiful lives are those that bless—  
Silent rivers of happiness.  
Whose hidden fountains few may guess  
  
Beautiful twilight, at set of sun  
Beautiful goal, with race well won,  
Beautiful rest, with work well done.  
  
Beautiful graves, where grasses creep,  
Where brown leaves fall, where drifts lie deep  
Over worn-out hands—Oh, beautiful sleep!
