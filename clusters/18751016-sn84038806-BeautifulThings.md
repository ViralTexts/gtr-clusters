Beautiful faces are those that wear,  
It matters little if dark or fair—    
Whole-souled honestly printed there.  
  
Beautiful eyes are those that show,  
Like crystal panes where hearth fires glow,  
Beautiful thoughts that burn below.  
  
Beautiful lips are those whose words  
Leap from the heart like songs of birds,  
Yet whose utterance prudence girds.  
  
Beautiful hands are those that do  
Work that is earnest and brave and true,  
Moment by moment the long day through.  
  
Beautiful feet are those that go  
On kindly ministries to and fro—  
Down lowest ways, if God wills it so.  
  
Beautiful shoulders are those that bear  
Ceaseless burdens of homely care  
With patient grace and daily prayer.  
  
Beautiful lives are those that bless—  
Silent rivers of happiness.  
Whose hidden fountains few may guess

Beautiful faces are those that wear—  
  
It matters little if dark or fair—  
  
Whole-souled honestly printed there.  
  
Beautifal eyes are those that show,  
  
Like crystal panes, where hearth-fires glow,  
  
Beautiful thoughts that burn below.  
  
Beautiful lips are those whose words,  
  
Leap from the heart like songs of birds,  
  
Yet whose utterance prudence girds.  
  
Beautiful hands are those that do  
  
Work that is earnest and brave and true,  
  
Moment by moment, the long day throngh.  
  
Beautiful feet are those that go  
  
On kindly ministries to and fro—  
  
Down lowliest ways, if God wills so.  
  
Beautiful shoulders are those that bear  
  
Ceaseless burdens of homely care  
  
With patient grace and daily prayer.  
  
Beautiful lives are those that bless —  
  
Silent rivers of happiness,  
  
Whose hidden fountains but few may guess.
