London, June 26. 1770  
It is a long time since I had the Pleasure of hearing from you directly. Mrs. Franklin has indeed now and then acquainted me of your Welfare, which I am always glad to hear of. It is, I fear, partly, if not altogether, my Fault that our Correspondence has not been regularly continued. One thing only I am sure of; that it has been from no want of Regard on either side, but rather from too much Business and Avocations of various kinds, and my having little of Importance to communicate.  
  
One of our good Citizens, Mr. Hillegas, anxious for the future Safety of our Town, wrote to me some time since, desiring I would enquire concerning the Covering of Houses here with Copper. I sent him the best Information I could then obtain; but have since receiv’d the enclos’d from an ingenious Friend, Mr. Wooller, who is what they call here a Civil Engineer. I should be glad you would peruse it, think of the matter a little, and give me your Sentiments of it. When you have done with the Paper, please to give it to Mr. Hillegas. I am told by Lord Despencer, who has covered a long Piazza or Gallery with Copper, that the Expence is charged in this Account too high; for his cost but 1/10 per foot, all Charges included. I suppose his Copper must have been thinner. And indeed it is so strong a Metal, that I think it may well be used very thin.  
It appears to me of great Importance to build our Dwelling-Houses, if we can, in a Manner more secure from Danger by Fire. We scarce ever hear of a Fire in Paris. When I was there, I took particular Notice of the Construction of their Houses; and I did not see how one of them could well be burnt. The Roofs are Slate or Tile; the Walls are Stone; the Rooms generally lin’d with Stucco or Plaister instead of Wainscot; the Floors of Stucco, or of sixsquare Tiles painted brown; or of Flag Stones or Marble; if any Floor were of Wood, it was Oak Wood, which is not so inflammable as Pine. Carpets prevent the Coldness of Stone or Brick Floors offending the Feet in Winter. And the Noise of Treading on such Floors overhead is less inconvenient than that on Boards. The Stairs too, at Paris, are either Stone, or Brick with only a Wooden Edge or Corner for the Step; so that on the Whole, tho’ the Parisians commonly burn Wood in their Chimneys, a more dangerous kind of Fuel than that used here, yet their Houses escape extreamly well, as there is little in a Room that can be consumed by Fire, ex[cept] the Furniture. Whereas [in] London, perhaps scarce a Year passes in which half a Million of Property and many Lives are not lost by this destructive Element. Of late indeed they begin here to leave off Wainscotting their Rooms, and instead of it cover the Walls with Stucco, often form’d into Pannels like Wainscot, which, being painted, is very strong and warm. Stone Staircases too, with Iron Rails, grow more and more into Fashion here. But Stone Steps cannot in some Circumstances be fixed; and there methinks Oak is safer than Pine; and I assure you that in many genteel Houses here, both old and new, the Stairs and Floors are Oak, and look extreamly well. Perhaps solid Oak for the Steps would be still safer than Boards; and two Steps might be cut diagonally out of one Piece. Excuse my talking to you on a Subject with which you must be so much better acquainted than I am. It is partly to make out a Letter for renewing our Correspondence, and partly in hope that by turning your Attention to the Point, some Methods of greater Security in our future Building may be thought of and promoted by you, whose Judgment I know has deservedly great Weight with our Fellow-Citizens. For tho’ our Town has not hitherto suffered very greatly by Fire, yet I am apprehensive, that some time or other, by a Concurrence of unlucky Circumstances, such as dry Weather, hard Frost, and high Winds, a Fire then happening may suddenly spread far and wide over our Cedar Roofs, and do us immense Mischief.  
If you favour me with a Line, let me know how good Mrs. Rhoads does, and every one of your Children; and how it fares with my dear old Friend Mrs. Paschal. With sincere Esteem, I am, Yours most affectionately,  
B Franklin

that the expenfe is charg’d in this ac-

it has been from no want of regard  
on either lide, but rather from too  
much bufinefs, and avocations of va¬

think of the matter a little, and give me your Sentiments  
of it. When you have done with the Paper, please to give  
it to Mr Hillegas. Iam told by Lord Despencer, who has  
covered a long Piazza or Gallery with Copper, that the ex-  
pence is charged in this Account too high; for his cost but  
1/10 # foot, all Charges included. I suppose his Copper  
must have been thinner. And indeed it is so strong a  
Metal, that I think it may well be used very thin.  
  
It appears to me of great Importance to build our Dwell-  
ing Houses, if we can, in a Manner more secure from  
Danger by Fire. We scarce ever hear of a Fire in Paris.  
When I was there, I took particular Notice of the Con-  
struction of their Houses; and I did not see how one of  
them could well be burnt. The Roofs are Slate or Tile the  
Walls are Stone; the Rooms generally lin’d with Stucco or  
Plaister instead of Wainscot; the Floors of Stucco, or of six  
square Tiles painted brown; or of Flag Stone or Marble,—  
if any Floor were of Wood, it was Oak Wood, which is not  
so inflammable as Pine. Carpets prevent the Coldness of  
Stone or Brick Floors offending the Feet in Winter, And  
the Noise of Treading on such Floors overhead is less in-  
convenient than that on Boards.—The Stairs too, at Paris  
are either Stone, or Brick with only a Wooden Edge or  
Corner for the Steps; so that on the Whole, tho’ the  
Parisians commonly burn Wood in their Chimneys, a more  
dangerous kind of Fuel than that used here, yet their  
Houses escape extreamly well, as there is little in a Room  
that can be consumed by Fire except the Furniture.  
Whereas in London perhaps scarce a Year passes in which  
half a Million of Property and many Lives are not lost by  
this destructive Element. Of late indeed they begin here  
to leave off Wainscotting their Rooms, and instead of it  
cover the Walls with Stucco, often form’d into Pannels like  
Wainscot, which, being painted, is very strong and warm:  
Stone Staircases too, with Iron Rails, grow more and more  
into Fashion here: But Stone Steps cannot in some Cir-  
cumstances be fixed; and there methinks Oak is safer than  
Pine; and I assure you that in many genteel Houses here,

both old &amp; new, the Stairs and Floors are Oak, and look ex-  
treamly well. Perhaps solid Oak for the Steps would be still  
safer than Boards; and two Steps might be cut diagonally  
out of one Piece.—Excuse my talking to you on a Subject  
with which you must be so much better acquainted than  
Iam. It is partly to make out a Letter for renewing our  
Correspondence, and partly in hope that by turning your  
Attention to the Point some Method of great Security in  
our future Building may be thought of &amp; promoted by  
you, whose Judgment I know has deservedly great Weight  
with our Fellow-Citizens.—For tho’ our Town has not  
hitherto suffered very greatly by Fire, yet I am apprehen-  
sive, that some time or other, by a Concurrence of unlucky  
Circumstances, such as dry Weather, hard Frost, &amp; high  
Wind, a Fire then happening may suddenly spread far and  
wide over our Cedar Roofs, and do us immense Mischief.—  
  
If you favor me with a Line, let me know how good  
Mrs Rhoads does, and every one of your Children; and  
how it fares with my dear old Friend Mrs Paschal. With  
  
sincere Esteem, I am  
Yours most affectionately  
  
B. FRANKLIN
