REGULARLY SOLD—During the month of January, 1850, two gentlemen from New York, one of whom had been in California nearly a year, and the other just arrived, were accidentally overheard in the following conversation at the Sutter House, Sacramento. The new comer was lamenting his condition, and his folly in leaving an abundance at home, and especially two beautiful daughters, who were just budding into womanhood—when he asked the other if he had a family.  
  
&quot;Yes, sir; I have a wife and six children in New York—and I never saw one of them.&quot;  
  
After this reply the couple sat a few moments in silence, and then the interrogator again commenced:  
  
&quot;Were you ever blind, sir?&quot;  
  
&quot;No, sir.&quot;

ow easy it is to approach the truth  
closely, without getting within a mile of it! Here is  
a case in point:  
During the month of January, 1850, two gentlemen from  
New York, one of whom had been in California nearly a  
year, and the other just arrived, were accidentally over­  
heard in the following conversation at the Sutter House,  
Sacremento. The new comer was lamenting his condition,  
and his folly for leaving an abundance at home, and espe­  
cially two beautiful daughters, who were just budding into  
womanhood, when he asked the other if he had a family.  
“Yes, sir, I have. I have a wife and six children in New

Puzzling.  
  
Two gentlemen from New York, one  
of whom had been in California nearly  
a year, and the other just arrived, were  
accidently overheard in the following  
conversation at the Sutter House, Sac-­  
ramento:  
  
The new comer was lamenting his  
condition, and especially his having  
 been compelled to leave behind two  
beautiful daughters who were just bud-­  
ding into womanhood, when he asked  
the other if he had a family.  
&quot;Yes, sir, I have a wife and six chil-­  
dren in New York, and I never saw one  
of them.&quot;  
  
After this the couple sat for a few  
moments in silence and then the inter-­  
rogator again commenced.  
&quot;Were you ever blind, sir?&quot;  
&quot;No, sir.&quot;
