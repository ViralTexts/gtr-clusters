sentments of me, and wale I am happy in yout es

The ides of making a tour tegether which you suga

mnotlves I could have to postpone my plan of retiree

mabits, which seem to acquire strength from restraint,

I am sensible of all I owe you, my dear  
sir, for your sentiments of me, and while  
I am happy in your esteem, I cannot but  
wish occasions of giving yeur marks of  
mins.  
The idea of making a you together,  
which you suggest, after the war, would  
be one of the strongest motives I could  
have to postpone my plan of retirement  
and make a visit to Europe, if my domes  
tic habits, which seem to acquire strength  
from restraint, did not tell me I shall find  
it impossible to resist them longer than  
my duty to my county calls for the sacri  
fice of my inclinations.

state that it would be superfluous to  
trouble you with anything relating to  
either. If I were to speak on topics of the
