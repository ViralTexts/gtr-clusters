 one, that when I consider the extream Corruption prevalent among all Orders of Men in this old rotten State, and the glorious publick Virtue so predominant in our rising Country, I cannot but apprehend more Mischief than Benefit from a closer Union. I fear They will drag us after them in all the plundering Wars their desperate Circumstances, Injustice and Rapacity, may prompt them to undertake; and their wide-wasting Prodigality and Profusion a Gulph that will swallow up every Aid we may distress ourselves to afford them. Here Numberless and needless Places, enormous Salaries, Pensions, Perquisites, Bribes, groundless Quarrels, foolish Expeditions, false Accompts or no Accompts, Contracts and Jobbs devour all Revenue, and produce continual Necessity in the Midst of natural Plenty. I apprehend therefore that To unite us intimately, will only be to corrupt and poison us also. It seems like Mezentius’s coupling and binding together the dead and the living,

ader will recollect, that  
when Nero was desirous of despatching  
his mother, and found himself at a loss  
for an expedient, Anicetus, a freed man,  
proposed to him, * the model of a ship  
upon a new construction, framed in such  
a manner that a part might be withdrawn,  
and the unsuspecting passenger commit-  
ted to the waves.” [ Tac. An. lib. 14. Ar.  
3.} Carrier is also said to have frequently  
practised the same refinement of cruclty,  
which Virgil in his 8th book of the neid,  
attributes to the tyrant Mezentius.  
Mortua quinetiam jungebat corpora Vivis,  
Componens manibusque manus, atque ori-  
  
bus ora,  
Tormenti genus! et, sanie taboque flu-  
entes,  
Complexu in misero, longa sic morte ne-  
cabat.

‘ and Burrampooter have no waves, or mount Sewalick no  
precipices. Had these ideas ever suggested themselves to  
the widows of Hindostan, we should never hear more of  
these Mezentian offerings,* the living linked with the dead,  
in one infernal. holocaust.

worked into the thread of his speech! The great advocate’s aim  
was to save the reckless heir of Felbrigg from a mad-house ; and as  
he neared the end of his harangue he said, as if the thought had but  
that moment crossed his brain: “Among the books which my  
client studied at Eton is one familiar to most of us, that tells of a  
cruel tyrant who tortured his hapless victims by chaining them to the  
putrefying bodies of the dead :—
