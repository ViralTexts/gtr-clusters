Franklin mentioned this private liturgy in his autobiography. Though he had had a conventional religious upbringing and contributed to the support of the Presbyterian meeting in Philadelphia, he seldom attended public worship, preferring to use Sundays for his own studies. Once, however, persuaded to go to church, he went five successive weeks but, finding no morality in the minister’s sermons, “was disgusted, and attended his Preaching no more. I had some Years before compos’d a little Liturgy or Form of Prayer for my own private Use, viz, in 1728. entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion. I return’d to the Use of this, and went no more to the public Assemblies.” The manuscript in Franklin’s hand survives, except for a few pages, and there is a transcript of the whole by William Temple Franklin.  
  
Articles of BeliefandActs of Religion  
  
In Two Parts.  
  
Here will I hold—If there is a Pow’r above us  
(And that there is, all Nature cries aloud,  
Thro’ all her Works), He must delight in Virtue  
And that which he delights in must be Happy.    Cato.  
  
Part I.  
  
Philada.  
Nov. 20 1728.  
  
First Principles  
I Believe there is one Supreme most perfect Being, Author and Father of the Gods themselves.  
For I believe that Man is not the most perfect Being but One, rather that as there are many Degrees of Beings his Inferiors, so there are many Degrees of Be

ch is infinite and incomprehensible, I cannot conceive otherwise, than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or requires no Worship or Praise from us, but that he is even INFINITELY ABOVE IT.  
But since there is in all Men something like a natural Principle which enclines them to Devotion or the Worship of some unseen Power;  
And since Men are endued with Reason superior to all other Animals that we are in our World acquainted with;  
Therefore I think it seems required of me, and my Duty, as a Man, to pay Divine Regards to Something.  
I CONCEIVE then, that the Infinite has created many Beings or Gods, vastly superior to Man, who can better conceive his Perfections than we, and return him a more rational and glorious Praise. As among Men, the Praise of the Ignorant or of Children, is not regarded by the ingenious Painter or Architect, who is rather honour’d and pleas’d with the Approbation of Wise men and Artists.  
It may be that these created Gods, are immortal, or it may be that after many Ages, they are changed, and Others supply their Places.  
Howbeit, I conceive that each of these is exceeding wise, and good, and very powerful; and that Each has made for himself, one glorious Sun, attended with a beautiful and admirable System of Planets.  
It is that particular wise and good God, who is the Author and Owner of our System, that I propose for the Object of my Praise and Adoration.  
For I conceive that he has in himself some of those Passions he has planted in us, and

, O God, for Ever.  
Amen.  
  
{  
After this, it will not be improper to read part of some such Book as Ray’s Wisdom of God in the Creation or Blacmore on the Creation, or the Archbishop of Cambray’s Demonstration of the Being of a God; &amp;c. or else spend some Minutes in a serious Silence, contemplating on those Subjects.  
  
Then SingMilton’s Hymn to the Creator  
  
These are thy Glorious Works, Parent of Good!  
Almighty: Thine this Universal Frame,  
Thus wondrous fair! Thy self how wondrous then!  
Speak ye who best can tell, Ye Sons of Light,  
Angels, for ye behold him, and with Songs,  
And Choral Symphonies, Day without Night  
Circle his Throne rejoicing. You in Heav’n,  
On Earth, join all Ye Creatures to extol  
Him first, him last, him midst and without End.  
Fairest of Stars, last in the Train of Night,  
If rather thou belongst not to the Dawn,  
Sure Pledge of Day! That crown’st the smiling Morn  
With thy bright Circlet; Praise him in thy Sphere  
While Day arises, that sweet Hour of Prime.  
Thou Sun, of this Great World both Eye and Soul  
Acknowledge Him thy Greater, Sound his Praise  
In thy Eternal Course; both when thou climb’st,  
And when high Noon hast gain’d, and when thou fall’st.  
Moon! that now meet’st the orient Sun, now fly’st  
With the fix’d Stars, fix’d in their Orb that flies,  
And ye five other Wandring Fires, that move  
In mystic Dance, not without Song, resound  
His Praise, that out of Darkness call’d up Light.  
Air! and ye Elements! the Eldest Birth  
Of Nature’s Womb, that in Quaternion run  
Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix  
And nourish all Things, let your ceaseless Change  
Vary to our great Maker still new Praise.  
Ye Mists and Exhalations! that now rise  
From Hill or steaming Lake, dusky or grey,  
Till the Sun paint your fleecy Skirts with Gold,  
In Honour to the World’s Great Author rise.  
Whether to deck with Clouds th’ uncolour’d Sky  
Or wet the thirsty Earth with falling Show’rs,  
  
Rising or falling still advance his Praise.  
His Praise, ye Winds! that from 4 Quarters blow,  
Breathe soft or loud; and wave your Tops ye Pines!  
With every Plant, in Sign of Worship wave.  
Fountains! and ye that warble as ye flow  
Melodious Murmurs, warbling tune his Praise.  
Join Voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds!  
That singing, up to Heav’n’s high Gate ascend,  
Bear on your Wings, and in your Notes his Praise.  
Ye that in Waters glide! and ye that walk  
The Earth! and stately Tread, or lowly Creep;  
Witness if I be silent, Ev’n or Morn,  
To Hill or Valley, Fountain or Fresh Shade,  
Made Vocal by my Song, and taught his Praise.

Here follows the Reading of some Book or part of a Book Discoursing on and exciting to Moral Virtue  
  
Petition.  
  
Prel.  
{  
In as much as by Reason of our Ignorance We cannot be Certain that many Things Which we often hear mentioned in the Petitions of Men to the Deity, would prove REAL Goods if they were in our Possession, and as I have Reason to hope and believe that the Goodness of my Heavenly Father will not withold from me a suitable Share of Temporal Blessings, if by a Virtuous and holy Life I merit his Favour and Kindness, Therefore I presume not to ask such Things, but rather Humbly, and with a sincere Heart express my earnest Desires that he would graciously assist my Continual Endeavours and Resolutions of eschewing Vice and embracing Virtue; Which kind of Supplications will at least be thus far beneficial, as they remind me in a solemn manner of my Extensive.  
  
Duty  
  
That I may be preserved from Atheism and Infidelity, Impiety and Profaneness, and in my Addresses to Thee carefully avoid Irreverence and Ostentation, Formality and odious Hypocrisy,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may be loyal to my Prince, and faithful to my Country, careful for its Good, valiant in its Defence, and obedient to its Laws, abhorring Treason as much as Tyranny,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may to those above me be dutiful, humble, and submissive, avoiding Pride, Disrespect and Contumacy,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may to those below me, be gracious, Condescending and Forgiving, using Clemency, protecting Innocent Distress, avoiding Cruelty, Harshness and Oppression, Insolence and unreasonable Severity,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may refrain from Calumny and Detraction; that I may avoid and abhor Deceit and Envy, Fraud, Flattery and Hatred, Malice, Lying and Ingratitude,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may be sincere in Friendship, faithful in Trust, and impartial in Judgment, watchful against Pride, and against Anger (that momentary Madness),  
Help me, O Father  
That I may be just in all my Dealings and temperate in my Pleasures, full of Candour and Ingenuity, Humanity and Benevolence,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may be grateful to my Benefactors and generous to my Friends, exerting Charity and Liberality to the Poor, and Pity to the Miserable,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may avoid Avarice, Ambition, and Intemperance, Luxury and Lasciviousness,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may possess Integrity and Evenness of Mind, Resolution in Difficulties, and Fortitude under Affliction; that I may be punctual in performing my Promises, peaceable and prudent in my Behaviour,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may have Tenderness for the Weak, and a reverent Respect for the Ancient; That I may be kind to my Neighbours, goodnatured to my Companions, and hospitable to Strangers,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may be averse to Craft and Overreaching, abhor Extortion, Perjury, and every kind of Wickedness,  
Help me, O Father  
  
That I may be honest and Openhearted, gentle, merciful and Good, chearful in Spirit, rejoicing in the Good of Others,  
Help me, O Father  
That I may have a constant Regard to Honour and Probity; That I may possess a perfect Innocence and a good Conscience, and at length become Truly Virtuous and Magnanimous,  
Help me, Good God,Help me, O Father  
  
And forasmuch as Ingratitude is one of the most odious of Vices, let me not be unmindful gratefully to acknoledge the Favours I receive from Heaven.  
  
Thanks.

or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any  
firaise, think on these things.’ And I imagined in a sermon on such  
a text, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confined  
himself to five points only as meant by the apostle: viz. Keeping holy  
the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy Scriptures. — 3.  
Attending duly the public worship. 4. Partaking ot the Sacrament.  
5. Paying a due respect to God’s ministers. These might be all good  
things, but as they were not the kind of good things that I expected  
from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other,  
was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had some years  
before composed a little liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own pri-  
vate use, (viz. in 1728,) entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Reli-  
gion. -I returned to the use of this, and went no more to the pub-  
lic assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it

relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.’

blessings, if by a virtuous and holy life I conciiiate his favour and kind-  
ness: therefore I presume not to ask such things; but rather humbly,  
and with a sincere heart, express my earnest desire that he would gra-  
ciously assist my continual endeavours and resolutions of eschewing  
vice and embracing virtue; which kind of supplications will at the same  
{ime remind me in a solemn manner of my extensive duty.

On Personification.  
  
And choral symphonies, day without night,  
Circle his throne rejoicing ; ye in heaven,  
  
On earth join, all ye creatures, to extol

If better thou belong not to the dawn,  
  
Sure pledge of day, that crown’st the smiling morn  
With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,  
While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.  
Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,  
Acknowledge him thy greater ; sound his praise  
In thy eternal course, both when thou &#x27;climb’st,  
And when high noon hast gain’d, and when thou fall’st.  
Moon, that now meet’st the orient sun, now fly’st  
With the fix’d stars, fix’d in their orb that flies;

In honour to the World’s great Author rise ;  
Whether to deck with clouds the uncolour’d sky,  
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,  
Rising or falling still advance his praise.  
  
His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow,  
Breathe soft or loud ; and wave your tops, ye pines,  
With every plant, in sign of worship wave.  
Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,  
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.  
Join voices, all ye living souls; ye birds,  
  
That singing up to heaven-gate ascend,  
  
Bear on your wings, and in your notes his praise.  
Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk

Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,  
If better thou belong not to the dawn,  
Sure pledge of day, that crowns’t the smiling morn  
With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,  
While day arises; that sweet hour of prime.  
Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,  
Acknowledge him thy greater, sound his praise  
In thy eternal course, both when thou climb’st,  
And when high noon hast gain’d, and when thou  
  
full’st.  
Moon, that now meet’st the orient sun, now fly’st,  
With the fix’d stars, fix’d in their orb that flies,  
And ye five other wand’ring fires that move  
In mystic dance, not without song, resound  
His praise, who out of darkness call’d up light.  
Air, and ye elements, the eldest birth  
Of Nature’s womb, that in quaternion run  
Perpetual circle, multiform, and mix  
And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change  
Vary to our great Maker still new praise.  
Ye mists and exhalations that now rise  
From hill or streaming lake, dusky or gray,  
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,  
In honour to the world’s great Author rise,  
Whether to deck with clouds th’ uncolor’d sky,  
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,  
Rising or falling, still advance his praise.  
His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow,  
Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye pines,  
With every plant, in sign of worship wave ;  
Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,  
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.  
Join voices, all ye living souls; ye birds,  
That, singing, up to heaven’s gate ascend,  
Bear on your wings, and in your notes his praise.  
Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk  
The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
