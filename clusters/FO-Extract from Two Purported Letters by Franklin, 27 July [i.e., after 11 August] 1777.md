r August 11], 1777.  
The King has complied with the request of Lord Stormount and committed Mr. Hodge to the Bastile. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Allan were sureties of captain Gustavus Conyngham. Mr. Hodge will not experience any inconvenience except a temporary deprivation of liberty.  
I have advised Mr. Hayfield Conyngham to leave France for a short time. He acts as agent for his father’s Commercial House in Europe, also for that of Robert Morris and several others who have pledged their lives and fortunes in the good cause.  
I think Lord Stormount will derive no advantage by the procedure in relation to Mr. Hodge. The ground of his application to the king was the open and avowed purpose of fitting out Conyngham to cruise against the English. “The notoriety of which act called” he said “all the energy of the French Government to suppress every such violation of the rights of nations by punishing in an exemplary manner each and every offender.”  
Signed B. Franklin.  
  
II.  
Your papers say that Stormont has secured Maurepass but Franklin the Queenn. Time will determine which has the best interest, be assured I am not afraid as to the result. The privateers give me great trouble and occasion a heavy expense. Many of their captures are retaken and Captain Conyngham has complained to me of the conduct of several of the agents who dispose of the prizes and make use of their proceeds without accounting for them.

In another letter of Dr. Franklin, I observe the fol-  
lowing.  
  
“Your papers say that Stormount has secured Maure-  
pass but Franklin the Queenn. ‘Time will determine  
which bas the best interest,be assured Lam not afraid as  
to the result. The privateers give me great trouble
