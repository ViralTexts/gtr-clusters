There are many women to-day thirsting for the word of praise, the language of encouragement. Through summer s heat and winter s toil they have drudged­ uncomplainingly, and so accustomed have their fathers, brothers and husbands become to their montonous labors, that they look for and upon them so they do the daily rising of the sun and its daily going down. Homely, every day life may be mad beautiful by an appreciation of its very homeliness You know that if the floor is clean, manual labor has been performed to make it so. You know that if you can take from your drawer a clean shirt whenever you &#x27;rant it, somebody&#x27;s fingers have ached ii the toil of making it so fresh and agreeable, s smooth and lustrous. Every thing that pleases the eye and the sense has been produced by constant work, much through great care, and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.<br/>

It is not that many men do not appreciate these things, and feel a glow of gratitude for the numberless attentions bestowed upon them in sickness and in health, but they are so selfish in that feeling They don&#x27;t come out with hearty &quot;Why, how pleasant you make things look, wife ; I am obliged to you for taking so much pains.&quot; They thank the tailor for giving them &quot;fits ;&quot; they thank the man in the full omnibus who gives them a seat; they thank, the young lady who moves along in the concert room ; in short, they thank everybody and everything out of doors, because it is the custom, and come home, tip their chairs back and their heels up, pull out the newspaper, grumble if wife asks them<br/>

<br/>
Praise your wife, man; for pity’s sake<br/>
give her a little encouragement; it won’t<br/>
hurt her. She has made your home<br/>
comfortable, your heart bright, your<br/>
lood agreeable; for pity’s sake tell her<br/>

don’t expect it; it will make her eyes<br/>

tor all that and you, too.<br/>
There are many women to-day thirst­<br/>
ing for a word of praise—the language<br/>
of encouragement. Through summer’s<br/>
heat and winter’s toil they have drud­<br/>
ged uncomplainingly, and so accustom­<br/>
ed have their fathers, brothers, and<br/>
husbands become to their labors, that<br/>
they look for and upon them as they do<br/>
the daily rising of the sun and its daily<br/>
going down. You know that if the<br/>
door is clean, labor has been performed<br/>
to make it so. You know that if you<br/>
can take from the drawer a clean shirt<br/>
whenever you want it, somebody’s<br/>
lingers have toiled. Everything that<br/>
pleases the eye and sense has been pro­<br/>
duced by work, thought, care and ef­<br/>
forts, bodily and mental.<br/>
Many men appreciate these things<br/>
and feel gratitude for the numberless<br/>
attentions bestowed upon them in sick­<br/>
ness and health; why don’t they come<br/>
out with a hearty. “Why, how pleas­<br/>
ant you make things look, wife,” or “1<br/>
am obliged to you for taking so much<br/>
pains.” They thank the tailor for a<br/>
good tit; they thank the man in the<br/>
horse car, who gives them a seat; they<br/>
thank the young lady who moves<br/>
along in the concert room; in short they<br/>
thank everybody and everything out­<br/>
of-doors, and come home, tip their<br/>
chairs hack and their heels up, pull out<br/>
the newspaper, scold if the fire has gone<br/>
down; or if everything is just right,<br/>
shut their mouths with a smack of<br/>
satisfaction, but never say “1 thank<br/>
you.”<br/>
I tell you what, men, young and old,<br/>
if you did but show the ordinary civil­<br/>
ity toward your wives; if you gave one<br/>
hundred and sixtieth part of the com­<br/>
pliments you almost choked them be­<br/>
fore they were married; if you would<br/>
stop the badinage about whom you are<br/>
going to have when the number one<br/>
is dead (such things wives may laugh<br/>
at, but they sink deep, sometimes); if<br/>
you would cease to speak of their<br/>
faults, however banteringly, before<br/>
others—fewer women would seek for<br/>
other sources of happiness. Praise<br/>
your wife, then, for all her good quali­<br/>
ties, and you may rest assured that her<br/>
deficiencies are no greater than you</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/iahi_ditto_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn87058308%2F00279529029%2F1887120801%2F0556.jp2/pct:33.537401,40.582771,8.614345,26.574052/!600,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />

Praise your wife, man! For pity&#x27;s<br/>

it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has made your<br/>
home comfortable, your hearth bright,<br/>
your food igroeable. For pity&#x27;s sake,<br/>

She doesn&#x27;t expect it; it will make her<br/>
eyes open wider than they have for the.-e<br/>
la-t ten years. 1&#x27;ut it will do her good,<br/>
for all that and you, too. There are<br/>
many women to-day thirsting for a<br/>
word of praise the language of en­<br/>
couragement. Through summer&#x27;s heat<br/>
and winter&#x27;s toil they have drudged un­<br/>

their fathers, brothers and hu-bands be­<br/>
come to their labors that they look for<br/>
and upon them as they do to the daily<br/>
rising of the sun and it- daily going<br/>
down. You know that if the tloor is<br/>
clean, labor has been performed to make<br/>
it so. You know that if you can take<br/>
from your drawer a clean shirt when­<br/>
ever you want it, somebody&#x27;s fingers<br/>
have toiled. Every thing that plea-es<br/>
the eye and the sense has been pro­<br/>
duced by work, thought, care and ef­<br/>
forts bodily and mental. Many men<br/>
appreciate these things, and feel grati­<br/>
tude for the numberless attentions<br/>
be-towed upon them in sickness and<br/>
health. Why don&#x27;t they comeout with<br/>
a hearty &quot;why. how pleasant you make<br/>
things look, wife.&quot; or &quot;l am obliged to<br/>
