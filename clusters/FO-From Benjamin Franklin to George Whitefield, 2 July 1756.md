New York, July 2. 1756  
I received your Favour of the 24th. of February with great Pleasure, as it inform’d me of your Welfare, and express’d your continu’d Regard for me. I thank you for the Pamphlet you enclos’d to me. As we had just observ’d a Provincial Fast on the same Occasion, I thought it very seasonable to be publish’d in Pensilvania, and accordingly reprinted it immediately.  
You mention your frequent Wish that you were a Chaplain to an American Army. I sometimes wish, that you and I were jointly employ’d by the Crown to settle a Colony on the Ohio. I imagine we could do it effectually, and without putting the Nation to much Expence. But I fear we shall never be call’d upon for such a Service. What a glorious Thing it would be, to settle in that fine Country a large Strong Body of Religious and Industrious People! What a Security to the other Colonies; and Advantage to Britain, by Increasing her People, Territory, Strength and Commerce. Might it not greatly facilitate the Introduction of pure Religion among the Heathen, if we could, by such a Colony, show them a better Sample of Christians than they commonly see in our Indian Traders, the most vicious and abandoned Wretches of our Nation? Life, like a dramatic Piece, should not only be conducted with Regularity, but methinks it should finish handsomely. Being now in the last Act, I begin to cast about for something fit to end with. Or if mine be more properly compar’d to an Epigram, as some of its few Lines are but barely tolerable, I am very desirous of concluding with a bright Point. In such an Enterprize I could spend the Remainder of Life with Pleasure; and I firmly believe God would bless us with Success, if we undertook it with a sincere Regard to his Honour, the Service of our gracious King, and (which is the same thing) the Publick Good.  
I thank you cordially for your generous Benefaction to the German Schools. They go on pretty well, and will do better, when Mr. Smith, who has at present the principal Care of them, shall learn to mind Party-Writing and Party Politicks less and his proper Business more; which I hope time will bring about.  
I thank you for your good Wishes and Prayers, and am, with the greatest Esteem and Affection, Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant  
B Franklin  
  
My best Respects to Mrs. Whitefield.

q RECEIVED your favor of the 24th of February, wij  
@ cat pleaiure, as it informed me of your welfare, and ,  
preficd your continued regard for me. I thank you for ty  
pamphlet you encloied to me. As we had jult obferved  
proviucial f ft on the fame occafion, I thought it very se,  
fonable to be pubinfhed in Pennfylvania ; and accerdingly r,  
printed it inimediately.  
  
You mention your frequent with that you were a chaplaiy  
to an American army. I fometimes with that you and |  
were Jointly employed by the crown to fettle a colony on th  
Ohio. J imagine that we could do it effceétually, and with  
Out putting the nation to much expence ; but I fear we thal  
mever be called upon for fuch afervice. What a glorioy  
thing it would be, to fettle in that fine country, a large ftron  
body of religious and induitrious people ! What a fecurity  
“xo the other colonies, and advantageto Britain, by increal.  
ing her people, territory, ttrength, and commerce! Migh  
at not greatly facilitate the introdudtien of pure religion »  
mong the Heathen, if we could, by fuch acclony, then  
them a better fample of Chriftians than they commonly fee  
an our Indian traders? Vhe moft ‘vicious and abandoned  
wretches of our nation! Life, hke a dramatic piece, fhoull  
not only be conducted with regularity, but, methinks it  
¥hould finifh handfomely. Being now in the laft adt, I be-  
gin to caft about for fomething fit to end with, Or, if mine  
be more properly compared to an epigram, as fome of it  
jines are but barely tolerable, I am very defirous of conclud.  
ing with abright point. In fuch au enterprize I could {pend  
the remainder of life with pleafure: and I‘firmly believe God  
would blefs us with fuccefs, if we undertook it with a fincere  
regard to his honour, the fervice of our gracious king and  
(which is the fame thing) the public good.  
  
I thank you cordially for your generous benefation to the  
German {chools. ‘They go on pretty well; and will do better  
when Mr. Smith, who has the principal care of them, fhail  
dearn to mind party writing and party politics Jefs, and his  
proper buatinefs more; which, I hope, time will bring about  
  
(thank you for your-good withes and prayers, and am,
