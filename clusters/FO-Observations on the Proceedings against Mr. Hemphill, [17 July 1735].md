ond comparison the most useful Method of Preaching. And because the whole would not have answered their Ends, they have omitted the explaining part which immediately followed, viz. in this I include the enforceing the Rules of Virtue by all the peculiar Motives which the christian Religion suggests, making all its Doctrines subservient to Holiness. Which I say is the End and Design of the christian Scheme, for Christ gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar People zealous of Good-Works. And there is scarcely a Chapter in the whole Gospels or Epistles from which this Doctrine can’t be prov’d. And the next Extract they produce, viz: God hath no Regard to any thing but Mens inward Merit and Desert, is in my humble Opinion as little to the purpose as the other.

We have stated only a few, and  
them with brevity, of what we name  
the evangelical principles of our  
church. That they are few, is owing  
to their being so far sufficient, as that  
they cannot consistently be held in al-  
liance with any opinion, dissonant  
from the truth, that salvation is of  
  
race. Our brevity is owing to the  
Sastre which we entertain, of noticing  
principally the result of the principle  
on our ecclesiastical concerns: the  
existence of the principle being consi-  
dered as a matter hardly liable to be  
denied or doubted of.
