A jeweller of Lyon, a certain M. Carriat,

tune, estimated at 500,000 francs, to the town

always lived with the utmost economy and  
was indeed generally considered a miser  
But it seems now that his object far from  
being the mere accumulation of wealth, was  
to create in Bourg an establishment to be

should be gratuitously taught drawing, ge  
ometry, and mathematics, as well as singing
