**The Properties of the Tomato.**  
  
To many persons there is something unpleasant, not to say disgusting, in the flavor of this excellent fruit. It has, however, long been used for culinary purposes, in various countries of Europe, and has of late years been extensively cultivated, and become a general favorite in this country. Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebrity, considers it an invaluable article of diet, and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties. He declares:—  
  
1. That the Tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the *Materia Medica*, and that in all those affections of the liver, and other organs where calomel is indicated, it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial agent known in the profession.  
2. That a chemical extract will be obtained from it, which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases.  
3. That he has successfully treated diarrh&amp;oelig;a, with this article alone.  
4. That when used as an article of diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion.  
5. That persons arriving from the east or north, to the south or west, should be all means make use of it as an aliment, as it would, in that event, save them the danger of attendant upon those violent bilious attacks to which almost all unacclimated persons are liable.  
6. That the citizens in ordinary should make use of it, either raw, cooked, or in the form of a catsup, with their daily food, as it is the most healthy article in the *materia alimentaria*.   
  
Professor Ratinesque of France says: &quot;It is everywhere deemed a very healing vegetable, vegetable, and invaluable article of food.&quot;   
  
Dungleson says:—&quot;It may be looked upon as one of the most wholesome and valuable esculents that belong to the vegetable kingdom.&quot;  
  
Professor Dickens asserts that it may be considered more wholesome than any other acrid sauce.   
  
A writer in the Farmer&#x27;s Register says: &quot;It has been tried by several persons, with decided success. They were afflicted with a chronic cough, the primary cause of which, in one case, was supposed to be diseased liver—in another, diseased lungs. It mitigates, and sometimes effectually checks a fit of coughing.  
  
The method most commonly adopted in preparing this fruit for daily use, is to cut them in slices, and serve with salt, pepper and vinegar, as you do cucumbers.  
  
To stew them: remove them ripe from the vines, slice up, and put them in a pot over the stove or fire, without water. Stew them slowly, and when done, put in a small piece of good butter, and eat them as you do apple sauce.—Some add a little flour, bread finely crumbled, or a couple of crackers pulverized.  
  
The Tomato is a fruit very easily raised. If the seed be sown in May, in good rich soil, of a warm nature, with a sufficiency of old, well-rotted manure, there will rarely be a danger of failure. When the vines begin to lean, they should be provided with a trellis, or tied to stakes fixed in the soil, to keep the fruit from being injured by coming in contact with the dirt.

Professor Rafinesque, of France, says: “It is

To many persons tliere is something msl  
&#x27; pleasant, not to say disgnsiing, in the llivor  
;of this excellent fruit. It leas, however, long

been extensively cultivated ami become a

j a professor of some celebrity, considers it an  
| invaluable article of iIK t. and ascribes to it  
very important medicinal properties. He de­  
, dares :  
1. That the Tomato is one of the most  
powerful deobstruents of the Mifrrin Mrclica,  
and that in all those a flections of the liver anti  
| other organs where calomel is indicated, it is  
probably the most eflVcti ve and least harmful

would in that event save them the danger at­  
tendant upon those violent bilious attacks to  
which almost all unaceltmated persons are  
liable.

make use of it. either raw, c-oked or in the  
form of a catsup, with their daily f. -d as it is

Professor Hafinesque of France says: “ft

Professor Dickens asserts that it may be  
considered more wh desome than any other

It has been tried by several persons, with de­  
citied success. They were atfi&#x27;dtd with a

Tue Tomaro.—~To many pereons  
there is something unpleasant, not to  
say diegusung, in the flavor of this ex­  
cellent fruit. It has, however, long  
been used for culinary purposes in va­  
rious countries of Europe, and has of  
late years been extensively cultivated,  
and become a general favorite in this  
country. Dr. Bennett, a professor of  
some celebrity, considers it an invalua­  
ble article of diet, and ascribes to it very  
immportant medicinal properties.  
  
1. That the Tomato is one of the Tnost  
powerlul deobstruents of the Materia  
Medica, and that in all those arfections  
ol the liver and other organs where cal­  
omel is indicated, it is probably the  
most effective and least harmful reme­  
dial agent known in the profession.  
  
2. That a chemical extract will be  
obtained trom it, which will altogether  
supersede the use of&#x27; calomel in the cure  
of diseases.  
  
3. That he has successfully treated  
serious diarrheea with this article  
alone.  
4. That when used as an article of  
diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for  
dyspepsia or indigestion.  
5. That persons removing from the  
east or north to the south or west should  
by all means make use of it as an ali.  
ment, as it would, in that event, save  
them the danger attendant upon those  
violent bilious attacks to which al­  
most all unacclimated persons are lia­  
ble.  
  
6. Thut the citizenein ordinary should  
make vee of it, either raw, cooked, or  
in the form of a eatsup, with their daily  
food, ns it is the most healthy article in  
the Materia Alimentaria.  
  
Professor Rasfinesque, of France, says:  
—-Itis every where deemed a very  
healing vegetuble, and an invaluable  
article of&#x27;lood.”  
  
Dungleson says:—&#x27;lt may be looked  
upon as one ol the most wholesome and  
viaiuable esculents that belong to the  
vegetable kingdow,”  
Professor Dickens asserts that ‘it may  
be considered more wholesome than any  
other urid sauce.  
  
A writer in the Farmeres’ Register  
says :-~“It has been tred by several  
persons, with decided success. They  
were afllicted with a chronie cough, the  
primary cause of which, in one case,  
was supposed to be diseased liver—in  
another, iselscd lungs. It mitigates,  
and sometimes cflectually checks, a fit  
ol coughing. :  
The method most commonly adopted  
in preparing this ruit for daily use, is  
to cut them into slices, and serve with  
salt, pepper, and vinegar, as you do cu­  
cumbers,  
  
To stew them ; remove them ripe  
from the vinee, slice up, and put them  
in a pot over the stove or fire, without  
water. Stew them slowly, and, when  
done, put in a small piece of butter, and  
eat them as you do apple sauce. Some  
add a little flour bread, finely erumbed,  
or a couple of crackers pulverized.  
The Tomato is a fruit very easily  
raised. It the seed be sown in May, in  
good rich soil, of a 4 warm nature, with  
a sufficiency of old well rotted manure,  
there will rarely beany danger of fail­  
ure. When the vines begin to lean,  
they should be provided with a trellis, or  
tied to stakes fixed in the sooil, to keep  
the fruit from being injured in coming  
in contiret with the dirt.

THE TOMATO ITS PROPERTIES.  
I)r. Bennett, a professor of some  
celebrity, considers the tomato an in­  
valuable article of diet, and ascribes  
to it very important medical qualities.  
1. The tomato is one of the most  
powerful aperients of the Materia  
Medico, and in those affections of  
the liver and organs, where calomel  
is indospensable, it is probably the  
most effective and least harmful agent  
known to the profession.  
2. That a chemical extract will be  
obtained from it which will altogether  
supercede the use of calomel in the  
cure of disease.  
  
That he has successfully treated  
diairlnea with this article alone.  
4. That when used as an article of  
diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy  
for dyspepsia and indigestion.
