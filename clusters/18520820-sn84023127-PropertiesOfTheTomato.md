**The Properties of the Tomato.**  
  
To many persons there is something unpleasant, not to say disgusting, in the flavor of this excellent fruit. It has, however, long been used for culinary purposes, in various countries of Europe, and has of late years been extensively cultivated, and become a general favorite in this country. Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebrity, considers it an invaluable article of diet, and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties. He declares:—  
  
1. That the Tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the *Materia Medica*, and that in all those affections of the liver, and other organs where calomel is indicated, it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial agent known in the profession.  
2. That a chemical extract will be obtained from it, which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases.  
3. That he has successfully treated diarrh&amp;oelig;a, with this article alone.  
4. That when used as an article of diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion.  
5. That persons arriving from the east or north, to the south or west, should be all means make use of it as an aliment, as it would, in that event, save them the danger of attendant upon those violent bilious attacks to which almost all unacclimated persons are liable.  
6. That the citizens in ordinary should make use of it, either raw, cooked, or in the form of a catsup, with their daily food, as it is the most healthy article in the *materia alimentaria*.   
  
Professor Ratinesque of France says: &quot;It is everywhere deemed a very healing vegetable, vegetable, and invaluable article of food.&quot;   
  
Dungleson says:—&quot;It may be looked upon as one of the most wholesome and valuable esculents that belong to the vegetable kingdom.&quot;  
  
Professor Dickens asserts that it may be considered more wholesome than any other acrid sauce.   
  
A writer in the Farmer&#x27;s Register says: &quot;It has been tried by several persons, with decided success. They were afflicted with a chronic cough, the primary cause of which, in one case, was supposed to be diseased liver—in another, diseased lungs. It mitigates, and sometimes effectually checks a fit of coughing.  
  
The method most commonly adopted in preparing this fruit for daily use, is to cut them in slices, and serve with salt, pepper and vinegar, as you do cucumbers.  
  
To stew them: remove them ripe from the vines, slice up, and put them in a pot over the stove or fire, without water. Stew them slowly, and when done, put in a small piece of good butter, and eat them as you do apple sauce.—Some add a little flour, bread finely crumbled, or a couple of crackers pulverized.  
  
The Tomato is a fruit very easily raised. If the seed be sown in May, in good rich soil, of a warm nature, with a sufficiency of old, well-rotted manure, there will rarely be a danger of failure. When the vines begin to lean, they should be provided with a trellis, or tied to stakes fixed in the soil, to keep the fruit from being injured by coming in contact with the dirt.

those of mercury, and thut a chemical extract

supersede the use of calomel in the cure of dis­  
ease. This impression has become at the pres­

paratively harmless, we have no just grounds  
for considering it otherwise than erroneous. In

The Tomato.—To many persons there is some­  
thing unpleasant, not to say disgusting, in the flavor  
of this excellent fruit. It has, however, lung been  
used for culinary purposes, in various countries ol  
Euiope, and has ot late years been exlcusively cul­  
tivated, and become a general favorite in this coun­  
try. Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebiily,  
considers it an invaluable article of diet, and as­  
cribes to it very important medicinal properties.  
He declares:  
1. That the Tomato is one of the most powerful  
deobstruents of the Materia Medic a, and that in all  
those affections of the liver and other organs where  
calomel is indicated, it is probably the most effective  
and least harmful remedial agent known to the pro­  
fession.  
2. That a chemical extract will he obtained from  
it, which will altogether supersede the use of calo­  
mel in the cure of diseases.  
3. That he has successfully treated diarrhoea,  
with this article aioue.  
4. That, when used as an article of diet, it is al­  
most a sovereign remedy (or dyspepsia and indi­  
gestion.  
5. That persons arriving from the east or north,  
to the south or west, should by all means make use  
of it as an aliment, as it would, in that event, save  
them the danger attendant upon those violent billions  
attacks to which almost all unacclimated persons are  
liable.  
6. That the citizens in ordinary should make use  
of it, t iiher raw, cooked, or in the form of a catsup,  
with their daily food, as it is the most healthy arti­  
cle in the materia aliment aria.  
Professor Rafiuegqiie, of France, says:—“It is  
everywhere deemed a very healing vegetable, and  
an invaluable article of food.”  
Dungleson says:—“lt may be looked upon as one  
of the most wholerome and valuable esculents that  
b -long to the vegetable kingdom.”  
Professor Dickens asserts that it may be consid«  
ered more wholes . ie than any other acrid sauce.  
A writer in the Farmer&#x27;s Register says:—“lt has  
been tried by several persons, with decided success.  
They were afflicted with a chronic cough, the pri­  
mary cause of which, m one case, was supposed to  
be diseased liver—in another, diseased lungs. It  
mitigates, and sometimes effectually checks a fit of

The method most commonly adopted in preparing  
this liuit for daily use, is to cut them in slices,

To stew them, remove them ripe from the vines,

done, put in a 6tnall piece ot good butter, and eat  
them as you do apple sauce. Some add a little  
flour bread, finely crumbled, or a couple of crackers  
pulverized.  
The Tomato is a fruit very easily raised. If the  
seed be sown in May, in good rich soil, of a warm  
nature, with a sufficiency of old, well-rotted manure,  
there will rarely be any danger of failure. When  
tne vines begin to lean, they should be provided with  
a trellis, or tied to stakes fixed in the soil, to keep  
the fruit from being injured by coming in contact  
with the dirt.

long been used for culinary purposes in  
various parts of Europo. Dr. Bennett, a  
professor of some celebrity, con-siders

ascribes to it very important medicinal  
properties. Ho declares-1. That the  
tomato is ono of tho moat powerful

that, in all those affections of tho  
liver and other organs whero calomel is  
indicated, it is probably the most

commonly adopted in preparing this fruit  
for daily use, is to cut thom m slices,

Some such an experience must have  
led to our custom of taking apple sauce  
with rbast pork, rich goose, and like  
dishes. The malic acid of ripe apples,  
either raw or cooked, will neutralize any  
excess of chalky matter engendered by

the pear, the plum, when taken ripe and  
without sugar, diminish acidity in the  
stomach, rather than provoke it. Their  
vegetable sauces and juices are converted  
into alkaline carbonates, which tend  
to counteract acidity.?Southern Clinic.
