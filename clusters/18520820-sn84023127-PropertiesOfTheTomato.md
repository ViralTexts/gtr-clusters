**The Properties of the Tomato.**  
  
To many persons there is something unpleasant, not to say disgusting, in the flavor of this excellent fruit. It has, however, long been used for culinary purposes, in various countries of Europe, and has of late years been extensively cultivated, and become a general favorite in this country. Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebrity, considers it an invaluable article of diet, and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties. He declares:—  
  
1. That the Tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the *Materia Medica*, and that in all those affections of the liver, and other organs where calomel is indicated, it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial agent known in the profession.  
2. That a chemical extract will be obtained from it, which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases.  
3. That he has successfully treated diarrh&amp;oelig;a, with this article alone.  
4. That when used as an article of diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion.  
5. That persons arriving from the east or north, to the south or west, should be all means make use of it as an aliment, as it would, in that event, save them the danger of attendant upon those violent bilious attacks to which almost all unacclimated persons are liable.  
6. That the citizens in ordinary should make use of it, either raw, cooked, or in the form of a catsup, with their daily food, as it is the most healthy article in the *materia alimentaria*.   
  
Professor Ratinesque of France says: &quot;It is everywhere deemed a very healing vegetable, vegetable, and invaluable article of food.&quot;   
  
Dungleson says:—&quot;It may be looked upon as one of the most wholesome and valuable esculents that belong to the vegetable kingdom.&quot;  
  
Professor Dickens asserts that it may be considered more wholesome than any other acrid sauce.   
  
A writer in the Farmer&#x27;s Register says: &quot;It has been tried by several persons, with decided success. They were afflicted with a chronic cough, the primary cause of which, in one case, was supposed to be diseased liver—in another, diseased lungs. It mitigates, and sometimes effectually checks a fit of coughing.  
  
The method most commonly adopted in preparing this fruit for daily use, is to cut them in slices, and serve with salt, pepper and vinegar, as you do cucumbers.  
  
To stew them: remove them ripe from the vines, slice up, and put them in a pot over the stove or fire, without water. Stew them slowly, and when done, put in a small piece of good butter, and eat them as you do apple sauce.—Some add a little flour, bread finely crumbled, or a couple of crackers pulverized.  
  
The Tomato is a fruit very easily raised. If the seed be sown in May, in good rich soil, of a warm nature, with a sufficiency of old, well-rotted manure, there will rarely be a danger of failure. When the vines begin to lean, they should be provided with a trellis, or tied to stakes fixed in the soil, to keep the fruit from being injured by coming in contact with the dirt.

Virtues or THE Tomato.—A medical pro-

warmly in favor of the virtues of the Tomato.  
He says of it that in all those affections of the  
liver, and other organs, where calomel is indica-

harmful remedial agent known to the profession.  
That a chemical extract will probably soon be

Conner, « citizen of

Tue Tomato.—We are such lovers ourselves,  
of this capital vegetable, that we willingly believe  
all possible good of it, and therefore circulate, as  
far as our columns wilt go, a notice, by an M.D. of  
its many virtues, and of different modes of prepar-  
ing it.  
  
[From the Cleveland Herald.|  
Tomato.  
  
In a public lecture, introductory to my course on  
the principles 2nd practice of Midwifery, and the  
diseases of Women and Children, Hygiene, and  
Acclimatement, in the Medical College of the  
Willoughby University of Lake Erie, in the fall  
of 1834, in treating of the elements of Hygiene,  
I made the: following statement relative to the  
Solanwn Lycopersicum, or as it is generally call.  
ed, ‘Tomato, Love-Apple, Jerusalem-Apple, etc.,  
to wit :  
  
Ist. That it (the Tomato) is one of the most  
powerful de-obstruents, of the Materia Medica,  
and that in all those affections of the liver, and oth-  
er organs, where Calomel is indicated, itis probably  
the most effective, and least harmful remedial agent  
known tothe profession. (It is an invaluable pro-  
phylactic, or preventive, against Asiatic or As-  
phyxiated Cholera.)  
  
2d. That a chemical extract will probably soon  
be obtained from it, which will altogether supersede  
the use of Calomel in the cure of diseases,  
  
3d. That I had successfully treated Serous Diar-  
rhea with this article alone.  
  
4th. That when used as an article of diet, it  
is almost a sovereign remedy for dispepsia, or indi-  
gestion.

North, to the West or South, should by all means  
make use of it as an aliment, as it would in that

acclimated persons are liable.

use of it, either raw, cooked, or in form of catchup,  
with their daily food, as it is one of the most healthy  
articles of the Materia Alimentaria, etc. etc.

THE TOMATO.  
Doctor Bcnnet, a professor in the M«­

the following statements, iu one of his  
lectures before the students, upon the  
subject of the Tomato :  
1. I liat it is one of the most power­  
ful deobstrueuts of the Materia Medira,  
and that in all those affections of the liv­  
er, and other organs where calomel is  
indicated, it is probably the most effec­  
tive, and least harmful remedial agent  
known by the profession.  
2. That a chemical extract will pro­  
bably soon be obtained from it which  
will altogether supersede the use of calo­  
mel in the cure of disease.  
d. That fie has successfully treated  
serious dianhose with this article aloue.  
. 4* .1&#x27;hat when used as an article of  
diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for  
dyspepsia or indigestion.  
5. &#x27;1 hat persons removing from the  
East or North to the West or South,  
should by all means make use of it as an  
aliment, as it would in that event save  
them from the danger attendant upon  
those violent bilious attacks to which&quot;al­  
most all unacclimated persons are liable.  
6. I hat the citizens in general should

preserve them. Indeed, so little atten-  
tion has been given to their preservation, that many  
think they can have them no longer than during  
the season of their growth. They are easily rais-  
ed, produce abundantly, and, after a little use, all  
declare them to be a rich treat. ‘Their presence  
upon the table at any, or even with all meals of  
the day, is quite acceptable.  
  
A notice from you at this time, as to the best  
mode of putting them up for winter, would be of  
service to at least one of your readers.  
  
Yours, &amp;c., Y. BT.  
Answer by the Editor.  
The Tomato has long been known and used for  
  
  
  
culinary purposes in many portions of Europe, ir  
France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and within a few  
years lias become a general favorite in this coun.  
try.  
  
Dr. Bennett, a medical professor in one of our  
colleges, considers it an invaluable article of diet.  
He ascribes to it high medical properties, and de-  
clares,  
  
“Ist. That it (the tomato) is one of the most  
powerful deobstruents of the Materia Medica, and  
that in all of those affections of the liver and other  
organs where calomel! is indicated, it is probably  
the most effective and Jeast harmful remedial agent  
known in the profession.  
  
“2d. That a chemical extract will be obtained  
from it, which will altogether supersede the use of  
calomel in the cure of disease.  
  
“3d. That he has successfully treated serious  
diarrhea with this article alone.  
  
“4th. ‘That when used as an article of diet, it is  
alrnost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia or indi-  
gestion.  
  
“5th. That persons removing from the east or  
north to the suuth or west, should by all means  
make use of it as an aliment, as it would in that  
event save them from the danger attendant upon  
those violent bilious attacks to which almost all un-  
acclimated persons are liable.  
  
“Oth. That the citizens in ordinary should make  
use of it either raw, cooked, or in the form of a  
catsup, with their daily food, as it is the most

THE TOMATO--ITS PROpErTIES.  
Dr. Bennett, a professor of some

. THE  
TOMATO.-To many persons there is  
something unpleasant in tho flavour of  
this ex-cellent fruit. It has, however,  
long been used for culinary purposes in  
various parts of Europo. Dr. Bennett, a  
professor of some celebrity, con-siders  
it an invaluable articlo of diet, and  
ascribes to it very important medicinal  
properties. Ho declares-1. That the  
tomato is ono of tho moat powerful  
deobstruonts of tho materia medica, and  
that, in all those affections of tho  
liver and other organs whero calomel is  
indicated, it is probably the most  
effective and least harmful remedial  
agent known in the profession. 2. That a  
chemi-cal extract will bo obtained from  
it, which will altogether supersedo the  
use of calomel in the euro of diseases.  
3. That ho has successfully treated  
diarrhoea with this article alone. 4.  
That when used as an articlo of diet it  
is almost a sovereign remedy for  
dyspepsia and indigestion. 5. That  
persons in ordi-nary health should make  
use of it, cither raw, cooked, or in tho  
form of a catsup, with thendaily food,  
as it is the most healthy article in the  
materia alimentaria. A writer in the  
Far-mer&#x27;s Btgisler says,-&quot; It has been  
tried by several persons with decided  
success. Thoy were afflicted with  
chronic cough, the primary causo of  
which, in one case, was supposed to bo  
diseased liver- in another, diseased  
lungs. It mitigates and sometimes checks  
a fit of cough-ing. Tho method most  
commonly adopted in preparing this fruit  
for daily use, is to cut thom m slices,  
and sorvo with Bait, pepper, and vine-  
gar, as you do cucumbers. To stow them,  
re-move them ripe from the vines, slice  
up, and put them in a pot ovor the firo,  
without wafer. Stir them slowly, and  
when dono, put in a small j piece of  
good butter, and eat them as yo« do j

diseased liver, ■ in another, diseased  
lungs. .. Itmitgates and sometimes  
checks a fit of coughing. ^The method

To stew them, remove them rip3 from the

them slowly, and when done, putin a  
small piece .of good butter, and eat

 the following beneficial prop­  
erties of the tomato as given by a  
distinguished physician, and which  
will probably tend to encourage its  
more general use:  
1. That the tomato is one of the  
most powerful aperients of the ma­  
teria medica, and that in all those af­  
fections of the liver and organs  
Yvhere calomel is indispensible, it is  
probably one of the most effective

2. That the chemical extract pill

altogether supercede the use of cal­  
omel in the cure of disease.  
3. That he has successfully treat­  
ed diarrhiea with this article alone.  
4. That when used as an article

*5. That the eitizen in ordinary j
