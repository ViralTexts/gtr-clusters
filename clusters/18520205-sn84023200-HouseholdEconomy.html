To the poor, the weekly newspaper is a precious boon. They cannot afford books, and, indeed, would have but little time to read them. But for the merest trifle, hardly to be missed, a whole family may draw almost daily from an inexhaustible fund of reading. The father can discuss the contents of his newspaper at the breakfast table, with his wife and children, and go forth to his labor supplied with materials for thought, which cannot fail to make him wiser and better, and elevate him in the scale of humanity.&quot;<br/>
