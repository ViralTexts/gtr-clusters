eared to have been omitted. There was no Mention of the Bag.  
I am concerned that you had not, and I fear you have not yet found time to prepare your excellent Papers for Publication. By omitting it so long, you are wanting to the World, and to your own Honour.  
I thank you for the Remarks of your learned Friend at Carlisle. I had when a Youth, read and smiled at Pliny’s Account of a Practice among the Seamen of his Time, to still the Waves in a Storm by pouring Oil into the Sea: which he mentions, as well as the Use of Oil by the Divers. But the stilling a Tempest by throwing Vinegar into the Air had escaped me. I think with your Friend, that it has been of late too much the Mode to slight the Learning of the Ancients. The Learned too, are apt to slight too much the Knowledge of the Vulgar. The cooling by Evaporation was long an Instance of the latter. This Art of smoothing the Waves with Oil, is an Instance of both.  
Perhaps you may not dislike to have an Account of all I have heard, and learnt and done in this Way. Take it, if you please, as follows.  
In 1757 being at Sea in a Fleet of 96 Sail bound against Louisbourg, I observed the Wakes of two of the Ships to be remarkably smooth, while all the others were ruffled by the Wind, which blew fresh. Being puzzled with this differing Appearance I at last pointed it out to our Captain, and asked him the meaning of it? “The Cooks, says he, have I suppose, been just emptying their greasy Water thro’ the Scuppers, which has greased the Sides of those Ships a little;” and this Answer he gave me with an Air of some little Contempt, as to a Person ignorant of what every Body else knew. In my own Mind I at first slighted his Solution, tho’ I was not able to think of another. But recollecting what I had formerly read in Pliny, I resolved to make some Experiment of the Effect of Oil on Water when I should have Opportunity.  
Afterwards being again at Sea in 1762, I first observed the wonderful Quietness of Oil on agitated Water in the swinging Glass Lamp I made to hang up in the Cabin, as described in my printed Papers, page 438 of the fourth Edition. This I was continually looking at and considering, as an Appearance to me inexplicable. An old Sea Captain, then a Passenger with me, thought little of it, supposing it an Effect of the same kind with that of Oil put on Water to smooth it, which he said was a Practice of the Bermudians when they would strike Fish which they could not see if the surface of the Water was ruffled by the Wind. This Practice I had never before heard of, and was obliged to him for the Information, though I thought him mistaken as to the sameness of the Experiment, the Operations being different; as well as the Effects. In one Case, the Water is smooth till the Oil is put on, and then becomes agitated. In the other it is agitated before the Oil is applied, and then becomes smooth. The same Gentleman told me he had heard it was a Practice with the Fishermen of Lisbon when about to return into the River, (if they saw before them too great a Surff upon the Bar, which they apprehended might fill their Boats in passing) to empty a Bottle or two of oil into the Sea, which would suppress the Breakers and allow them to pass safely: a Confirmation of this I have not since had an Opportunity of obtaining. But discoursing of it with another Person, who had often been in the Mediterranean, I was informed that the Divers there, who when under Water in their Business, need Light, which the curling of the Surface interrupts, by the Refractions of so many little Waves, they let a small Quantity of Oil now and then out of their Mouths, which rising to the Surface smooths it, and permits the Light to come down to them. All these Informations I at times revolved in my Mind, and wondered to find no mention of them in our Books of Experimental Philosophy.  
At length being at Clapham, where there is, on the Common, a large Pond, which I observed to be one Day very rough with the Wind, I fetched out a Cruet of Oil, and dropt a little of it on the Water. I saw it spread itself with surprising Swiftness upon the Surface, but the Effect of smoothing the Waves was not produced; for I had applied it first on the Leeward Side of the Pond where the Waves were largest, and the Wind drove my Oil back upon the Shore. I then went to the Windward Side, where they began to form; and there the Oil tho’ not more than a Tea Spoonful produced an instant Calm, over a Space several yards square, which spread amazingly, and extended itself gradually till it reached the Lee Side, making all that Quarter of the Pond, perhaps half an Acre, as smooth as a Looking Glass.  
After this, I contrived to take with me, whenever I went into the Country, a little Oil in the upper hollow joint of my bamboo Cane, with which I might repeat the Experiment as Opportunity should offer; and I found it constantly to succeed.  
In these Experiments, one Circumstance struck me with particular Surprize. This was the sudden, wide and forcible Spreading of a Drop of Oil on the Face of the Water, which I do not know that any body has hitherto considered. If a Drop of Oil is put on a polished Marble Table, or on a Looking Glass that lies horizontally; the Drop remains in its Place, spreading very little. But when put on Water it spreads instantly many feet round, becoming so thin as to produce the prismatic Colours, for a considerable Space, and beyond them so much thinner as to be invisible except in its Effect of smoothing the Waves at a much greater Distance. It seems as if a mutual Repulsion between its Particles took Place as soon as it touched the Water, and a Repulsion so strong as to act on other Bodies swimming on the Surface, as Straws, Leaves, Chips, &amp;c. forcing them to recede every way from the Drop, as from a Center, leaving a large clear Space. The Quantity of this Force, and the Distance to which it will operate, I have not yet ascertained, but I think it a curious Enquiry, and I wish to understand whence it arises.  
In our Journey to the North when we had the Pleasure of seeing you at Ormathwaite, we visited Mr. Smeaton near Leeds. Being about to shew him the smoothing

 the Drop, but it remains in the Form of Oil, the Sides of the Dish putting a Stop to its Dissipation by prohibiting the farther Expansion of the Film.  
Our Friend Sir J. Pringle being soon after in Scotland, learnt there that those employed in the Herring Fishery, could at a Distance see where the Shoals of Herrings were, by the smoothness of the Water over them, which might be occasioned possibly, he thought, by some Oiliness proceeding from their Bodies.  
A Gentleman from Rhode-island told me, it had been remarked that the Harbour of Newport was ever smooth while any Whaling Vessels were in it; which probably arose from hence, that the Blubber which they sometimes bring loose in the Hold, or the Leakage of their Barrels, might afford some Oil to mix with that Water which from time to time they pump out to keep the Vessel free, and that same Oil might spread over the surface of the Water in the Harbour, and prevent the forming of any Waves.  
This Prevention I would thus endeavour to explain.  
There seems to be no natural Repulsion between Water and Air, such as to keep them from coming into Contact with each other. Hence we find a Quantity of Air in Water, and if we extract it by means of the Air-pump; the same Water again exposed to the Air, will soon imbibe an equal Quantity.  
Therefore Air in Motion, which is Wind, in passing over the smooth Surface of Water, may rub, as it were, upon that Surface, and raise it into Wrinkles, which if the Wind continues are the elements of future Waves.  
The smallest Wave once raised does not immediately subside and leave the neighbouring Water quiet; but in subsiding raises nearly as much of the Water next to it, the Friction of its Parts making little Difference. Thus a Stone dropt in a Pool raises first a single Wave round itself, and leaves it by sinking to the Bottom; but that first Wave subsiding raises a second, the second a third, and so on in Circles to a great Extent.  
A small Power continually operating will produce a great Action. A Finger applied to a weighty suspended Bell, can at first move it but little; if repeatedly applied, tho’ with no greater Strength, the Motion increases till the Bell swings to its utmost Height and with a Force that cannot be resisted by the whole Strength of the Arm and Body. Thus the small first-raised Waves, being continually acted upon by the Wind are, (tho’ the Wind does not increase in Strength) continually increased in Magnitude, rising higher and extending their Bases, so as to include a vast Mass of Water in each Wave, which in its Motion acts with great Violence.  
But if there be a mutual Repulsion between the Particles of Oil, and no Attraction between Oil and Water, Oil dropt on Water will not be held together by Adhesion to the Spot whereon it falls, it will not be imbibed by the Water, it will be at Liberty to expand itself, and it will spread on a Surface that besides being smooth to the most perfect degree of Polish, prevents, perhaps by repelling the Oil, all immediate Contact, keeping it at a minute Distance from itself; and the Expansion will continue, till the mutual Repulsion between the Particles of the Oil, is weakened and reduced to nothing by their Distance.  
Now I imagine that the Wind blowing over Water thus covered with a Film of Oil, cannot easily catch upon it so as to raise the first Wrinkles, but slides over it, and leaves it smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the Oil, indeed, which being between it and the water serves it to slide with, and prevents Friction as Oil does between those Parts of a Machine that would otherwise rub hard together. Hence the Oil dropt on the Windward Side of a Pond proceeds gradually to Leeward, as may be seen by the smoothness it carries with it, quite to the opposite Side. For the Wind being thus prevented from raising the first Wrinkles that I call the Elements of Waves, cannot produce Waves, which are to be made by continually acting upon and enlarging those Elements, and thus the whole Pond is calmed.  
Totally therefore we might supress the Waves in any required Place, if we could come at the Windward Place where they take their Rise. This in the Ocean can seldom if ever be done. But perhaps something may be done on particular Occasions, to moderate the Violence of the Waves, when we are in the midst of them, and prevent their Breaking where that would be inconvenient.  
For when the Wind blows fresh, there are continually rising on the Back of every great Wave, a number of small ones, which roughen its Surface, and give the Wind Hold, as it were, to push it with greater Force. This Hold is diminished by preventing the Generation of those small ones. And possibly too, when a Wave’s Surface is oiled, the Wind in passing over it, may rather in some degree press it down, and contribute to prevent its rising again, instead of promoting it.  
This as a mere Conjecture would have little weight, if the apparent Effects of pouring Oil into the Midst of Waves, were not considerable, and as yet not otherwise accounted for.  
When the Wind blows so fresh, as that the Waves are not sufficiently quick in obeying its Impulse, their Tops being thinner and lighter are pushed forward, broken and turned over in a white Foam. Common Waves lift a Vessel without entring it, but these when large sometimes break above and pour over it, doing great Damage.  
That this Effect might in any degree be prevented, or the height and violence of Waves in the Sea moderated, we had no certain Account, Pliny’s Authority for the Practice of Seamen in his time being slighted. But discoursing lately on this Subject with his Excellency Count Bentinck of Holland, his Son the Honble. Capt. Bentinck, and the learned Professor Allemand, (to all whom I showed the Experiment of smoothing in a Windy Day the large Piece of Water at the Head of the Green Park) a Letter was mentioned which had been received by the Count from Batavia, relating to the saving of a Dutch Ship in a Storm, by pouring Oil into the Sea. I much desired to see that Letter, and a Copy of it was promised me, which I afterwards received.

 Shore, which rendered it impracticable. My Idea was, that possibly by sailing to and fro at some Distance from such Lee Shore, continually pouring Oil into the Sea, the Waves might be so much depressed and lessened before they reached the Shore, as to abate the Height and Violence of the Surff and permit a Landing, which in such

ind the Point, (a Place more sheltered from the Sea) who came round and placed themselves opposite to the Longboat, where they might observe the Surff, and note if any Change occurred in it upon using the Oil: Another Party in the Barge plied to Windward of the Longboat, as far from her as she was from the Shore, making Trips of about half a Mile each, pouring Oil continually out of a large Stone Bottle, thro’ a Hole in the Cork somewhat bigger than a Goose Quill. The Experiment had not in the main Point the Success we wished; for no material Difference was observed in the Height or Force of the Surff upon the Shore: But those who were in the Longboat could observe a Tract of smoothed Water the whole Length of the Distance in which the Barge poured the Oil, and gradually spreading in Breadth towards the Longboat; I call it smoothed, not that it was laid level, but because tho’ the Swell continued, its Surface was not roughened by the Wrinkles or smaller Waves before-mentioned, and none, or very few Whitecaps (or Waves whose Tops turn over in Foam) appeared in that whole Space, tho’ to windward and leeward of it there were plenty; and a Wherry that came round the Point under Sail in her way to Portsmouth, seemed to turn into that Tract of choice, and to use it from End to End as a Piece of Turnpike Road.  
  
It may be of Use to relate the Circumstances even of an Experiment that does not succeed, since they may give Hints of Amendment in future Trials: It is therefore I have been thus particular. I shall only add what I apprehend may have been the Reason of our Disappointment.  
I conceive that the Operation of Oil on Water, is first to prevent the rai

men of his time, but has been generally  
onfidered a^ chimerical. In thefe letters,  
owever,tlic fadt is placed beyond difpute,  
s vcih appear frem the tollowing extradt:  
“ In 1 757,” fay Di Frai.khn,“ being at  
fea in a iLet of nincty-lix fail bt-iind a-  
gainlt L&lt;&#x27;iiil})iirg, I obferved the wakes of  
two of the Ihips to be remarkably fmooth,  
while all the others were rutiled by the  
wind, which blew frefli. Being puzzled  
with the different appearance, I at laft  
pviinted it out to our captain, and aiked  
him the meaning of it; “ The cooks,  
fays he, have, I fuppofe, been juft empty¬  
ing their greafy water through the feup-  
pers, which has greafed the lides of thofe  
(hips a little;” and this anfwer he gave  
me with an air of Ibme little contempt,  
as to a perfon ignorant of what every bo¬  
dy clfe knew. In my own mind 1 at firft  
flighted his folution, though 1 was not  
‘able to think of another: But recollec-  
I ting what I had formerly read in Pliny,  
1 rcfolved to ifiake fomc experiment of  
the effedf of oil on water, when I (hould  
have an opportunity.  
  
“ Afterwards being again at fea in  
1761, 1 firft obferved the wonderful  
quictnefs of oil on agitated water, in the  
fwinging glafs lamp 1 made to hang up  
in the cabin, as defcribtd in my printed  
papers, p. 458. of the fourth edition.  
This 1 was continually looking at and  
confidering, as an appearance to me inex¬  
plicable. An old fea captain, then a paf-  
  
fenger with me, thought little of It, fup-  
pnfing it an ctfcdl of the fame kitid with  
that of oil put on water to Iniooth it;  
Which iie faid a prai^fice of the Ber¬  
mudians when they would ftrike fillip  
wdiich they c&#x27;t&#x27;uld not fee, if ihe furfac^  
of ihe water was n-flled by the wind.  
This praiftioe I had never before heard  
of, &lt;anct WA^ obliged to him for the infor*  
mation ; though I thouglit liim miftakeit  
as to the famenefs of the experiment,! hp  
onerations being different, as well as thp  
ertcifts. In one cafe, the water is fmooth  
till the oil is put on, and tiicn becomei  
agitated. In the other it i ♦ agitated be¬  
fore the oil is applied, and then bccomei  
fmooth.—The fame gentleman told’me^  
he had heard it was a pradicc with the  
filhermen of Lifb &gt;fi when about to returri  
into the river, (if they faw before theiri  
too great a furf upon the bar, which they  
apprehended might fill their boats in paf-  
fing) to empty a bottle or two of oil in¬  
to the fea, wliich would fupprefs the  
breakers, and&#x27;allow them to paf&gt; fafely t  
A confirmation of this I have not lincP  
had an opportunity of obtaining. But  
difcourfing r&gt;f it with another perfon&#x27;,  
who had often been in the Mediterrane¬  
an, I was infe^med that the divers there&#x27;,  
who, when under water in their bufinefs^  
need light, which the curling of the fur-  
face interrupts by the refradions* of (b  
mriuy little waves, let a ftnall quantity of  
oil now and then out of their moiiihsi  
which fifing to the furface fmootlis it,  
and permits the light to come down tcl  
them. All thefe informations F at timed  
revolved in my mind, and wondered tfi  
find no mention of them in our books of  
experimental philofophy. &#x27;  
  
At length being at Clapham, whert  
there is&#x27;, on the Common, a large poAd^  
which I obferved to be one day very  
rough with the wind, I fetched out.a  
criiet of oil, and dropl a little of it on the  
water. I faw it fpread itfclf with furprif-  
inu fwiftiiefs upon the fui face| but the  
effed of fmoothing the waves was ndt  
produced; fori had applied nt firft&#x27;on  
the leeward fide of the pond, where the  
Waves w&#x27;cre largeft, and the wind drove  
my oil back upon the Ibore. I then went  
to the windward fide, where they began  
to form&#x27;; and thetc the oil, th ugh not  
morcthan&#x27;^a tea fpoonful, produced an

fied by the wind, which blew frehh. Be-  
ing puzzled with the differing appear-  
ance, I at Jafl pointed it out to our

if ? ** The cooks,” fays he, ** have, I fup-

fome little contempt, as to a perfor ig-  
norant of what every body elfe knew.  
In my own mind [ at firtt flighted his fo-  
lution, thowgh I was not able to think

had formerly read in Pliny, 1 refolved  
to make fome experiment of the cffeét  
of oil on water, when I thould have op-  
portunity.  
  
** Afterwards, being again at fea, in  
3762, I fit obierved the wonderful  
quietnefs of oil on agitated water, in  
the {winging gla(s lamp I made to hang  
up in.the cabin, as deferibed in my  
printed papers, p. 438 of the fourth  
edition. This I was continually look-  
ing at and confidering as an appearance  
to me inexplicable. An old fea cap-  
tain, then a paflenger with me, thought  
little of it, fuppofing it an effedt of the  
fame kind with that of oil put on water  
to fmooth it, which he faid was a prac-  
tice of the Bermudians when they would  
ftrike fith, which they conid not fee, if  
the furface of the water was ruffled by  
  
  
  
the wind. This praétice I had never  
before heard of, and was obliged to him  
for the information ; though I thought  
him miftaken as to the famenefs of the  
experiment, the operations being d:ffe-  
rent, as well as she effeéts. In one  
cafe, the water is fmooth till the oil is  
put on, and then becomes agitated; in  
the other it !s agitated before the oi} is  
applied, and then becomes fmooth.—  
The fame gentleman told me, he had  
heard it was a praétice with the fither-  
men of Lifbon, when abont to return  
into the river, (if they faw before them  
too great a fu:f upon the bar, which  
they apprehended might fill their boats  
in pafling) to empty a bottle or two of  
oil into the fea, which would fupprefs  
the breakers, and allow them to pafs  
fafely : a confirmation of this I have  
not fince had an opportunity of obtain-  
ing. But dilcourting of it with ano-  
ther perfon, who had often been in the  
Mediterranean, I was informed that the  
divers there, who, when under water  
in their bufinefs, need hight, which the  
curling of the turface inter:upts by the  
refraétions of fo many little waves, let  
a fmal] quantity of oil now and then  
out of thir mouths, which rifing to the  
furface finooths it, and permits tne light  
to come down to them.—All thefe in-  
formations I at times revolved in my  
mind, and wondered to find no men-  
tion of them in our books of experi-  
mental philofophy.  
  
* At length, being at Claphe.n,  
where there 1s, on the common, a Jarge  
pond, which I obferved to be one day  
very rough with the wind, I fetched  
out a cruct of oiJ, and diopt a little of  
it on the water. I faw it tpread itfelf  
with furprifing fwiftnefs upon the (ur-  
face; but the effe&amp;t of {moothing the  
waves was not produced ; for I had ap-  
plied it firft on the teeward fide of the  
pond, where the waves were largetl, and  
the wind drove my oil back upon the  
fhore. I then went to the windward  
fide, where they began to form; and  
there the oil, thongh not more than a  
tea-{poonful, produced an inflant calm  
over a fpace feveral yards fquaie,  
wiich fpread amazingly, and extended  
itfelf gradually till it reached the lee-  
fide, making al! that quarter of the  
pond, perhaps half an acre, as fmooth  
as a looking-glafs.  
  
«© After this, I contrived to take  
with me, whenever I went into the  
country, 2 little oil in the upper hol-  
low joint of my bamboo-cane, with

* In thele experiments, one circum-  
ftance firuck me with particular fur-  
prize. This was the fudden, wide,  
and forcible fpreading of a diop of oil,  
on the face of the water, which I do  
not know that any body has hitherto  
confidered. If adrop of @il is put on  
a polifhed marble table, or on a look-  
ing glafs that lies horizontally, the  
drop remains in its place, {preading  
very little; but, when put on water,  
it. fpreads inftantly many feet round,  
becoming (0 thin as to produce the prif-  
matic colours, for a confiderable fpace,  
and beyond them fo much thinner as  
to be invilible, except in its effect of  
fmoothing the waves at a avach greater  
diftance. It feems as if a mutual re-  
pulfion between its particles took place  
as foon as it touched the water, and a  
vepulfion fo flrong as to a&amp; on other bo-  
dies (wimming on the surface, as Rraws,  
leaves, chips, &amp;c. forcing them to re-  
. cede every way from the drop, as from  
a center, leaving a large clear fpace.  
The quantity of this force, and the dif-  
tance to which it will operate, I have  
not yet afcertained; but I think it a

ters, however, the fact is placed beyond  
difpute, as will appear from the following  
extract;  
  
“ In 1757, fays Dr. Franklin, being at  
fea in a fleet of ninety-fix fail bound a-  
gainft Louifbourg, I obferved the wakes  
of two of the fhips to be remarkably  
{mooth, while all the others were ruffled

me with an air of fome little contempt, as

never before heard of, and was obliged to

him for the information ; tho’ I thought  
him miftaken as to the famenefs of the  
experiment, the operations being differ-  
ent, as well as the effects. In one cafe,  
the water is fmooth till the oil is put on,  
and then becomes agitated. In the other,  
it is agitated before the oil is applied,  
and then becomes fmooth. The fame

firft to attend particularly to it; and the various informations  
which he afterwards received relating to it, induced him to tr  
fome experiments on the fubject. Standing on the windward  
fide cf a large pond at Clapham, the (urface of which was ren-  
dered very rough with the wind, be poured a tea-/poonful of oil  
on the water, He had the pleafure to fee this {mall quantity

I was continually looking at and

thought little of it, fuppofing it  
an efeét of the fame kind, with that

never before heard of, and was  
obliged to him for the information;  
though I thought him mittaken as  
to the famenefs of the experiment,  
the operations being different, as  
well as the effects. In one cafe,  
the water is fmooth till the oil is  
put on, and then becomes a itated.  
In the other, it is agitate before  
the oil is applied, and then becomes  
{mooth.—T&#x27;he fame Gentleman

informations which he afterwards  
received rela-ting to it induced him to  
try some experiments on the subject.  
Standing on the windward side of a large  
pond, the surface of which was rendered  
very rough with the wind, he poured a  
tea-spoonful of oil on the water. This  
small quantity produced an instant calm  
over a space of se\eral yards square,  
which spread amazingly and extended  
itself gradually, till it reached the  
lee side, making all that quarter of the  
pond, per-haps half an acre, as smooth  
as a looking-glass. &#x27; On repeating this  
experiment, which constantly suc-ceeded,  
one circumstance struck him with  
particular surprise ; this was the  
sudden, wide, and forcible, spreading of  
a drop of oil on the face of the water,  
which, he adds,&quot; I do not know that any  
body has considered.&quot; When a drop of oil  
is put on aloo! ing-glass, or polished  
marble, it spreads very little; but on  
water it instantly expands into a circle  
extending several feet in diameter,  
becoming so thin as to produce the pris-  
matic colours, for a considerable space,  
&amp; beyond them so much thinner as to be  
invisible, except in its effects of  
smoothing the waves at a much greater  
distance. It seems, says Dr. Franklin,  
as if a mutual repulsion be. tween its  
particles took place as soon as it  
touched the water, and a repulsion so  
strong as to act on other bo-dies  
swimming on the surface, as straws,  
leaves, &amp;c. forcing them to recede every  
way from the drop, as from a center,  
leaving a large clear space. In endea-

that there seems to be no natural  
repulsion between water and air, such as  
to keep them from coming into contact  
with each other.-There-fore air, in  
motion, which is wind, in passing over  
the smooth surface of water, may rub, as  
it were, on that surface, and rise it  
into wriukles, which, if the wind  
continues, are the elements of future  
waves. The smallest does not immediately  
subside, but in subsi-ding raises nearly  
as much of the water next, to it. A  
small power, continually operating, will  
produce a great action : so that the  
first-raised waves being con-tinually  
acted upon by the wind, are, though the  
wind does not increase in strength,  
continually increased in magnitude,  
rising higher and extending their basis,  
so as to include a vast mass of water in  
each wave, which, in its motion, acts  
with great.violence. But if there be a  
mutual repulsion between the particles  
of oil, and no attraction bctw ecu oil  
and Avater, oildropt on Avaler will not  
be held together by adhesion to the spot  
on which it falls ; it will not be  
imbibed by the water; but be at liberty  
to expanel itself and spread on a sur-  
face, that prevents, perhaps,  
by&#x27;repeliing the oil, all im-mediate  
contact ; the: expansion will continue  
till the mutual repulsion between the  
paticles of oil is weak-ened and reduced  
to nothing by their distance. Dr.  
Franklin imagines, that the wind,  
blowing over water, thus covered with  
afilm of oil, cannot easily catch upon  
it, so as to raise the first wrinkles,  
nut slides over it, and leaves it smooth  
as it finds it. It moves a little the  
oil, indeed, which, being between it and  
the water, serves it to slide Avith, and  
prevents friction : hence the oil, dropt  
on the windward side of the pond,  
proceeds gradually to leeward, as may be  
seen by the smooth-ness it carries with  
it quite to the opposite side : for the  
wind, being thus prevented from raising  
the first wrin-kles, which he calls the  
elements of Avaves, cannot produce  
Avaves, Avhich are to be made by  
continually acting upon and enlarging  
those elements, and thus the Avhole pond  
is calmed Upon the whole, there is great  
room to suppose (notwithstanding the  
partial failure of an experiment made at  
Portmouth, by Dr. Franklin, and others),  
that seafaring people may de-rive  
advantages from using oil on particular  
occasion*» in order to moderate the  
violence of the Avaves, orto lessen th

a little oil on the sea, in order to&#x27;still its motion, that  
they might be enabled to see the oysters lying at its  
bottom: Sir Gilfred had often seen this done. Dr.  
Franklin was informed that many of the divers on the  
coast of Italy were accustomed to take a little oil in  
their mouths before they dived; when they had  
descended to a certain depth, they allowed the esca  
of the oil, which, rising to the surface by virtue of its  
lightness, spread in a thin film, which smoothed the

water-ripples, and allowed light to descend to a con-  
siderable depth. The fishermen of Lisbon, when  
about to return into the river, if they saw before them  
too great a surf upon the bar, were accustomed to  
empty a bottle or two of oil-into the sea, to still the  
breakers. Sir John Pringle was informed that the  
persons employed in the herring fishery off the coast  
of Scotland could see at a distance where the shoals of  
herrings were, by the smoothness of the water over  
them, occasioned, as he supposed, by some kind of  
oiliness proceeding from the bodies of the fish. It has  
been observed by the seal-catchers on the coast of  
Scotland, that when these animals are devouring a  
very oily fish, which they do under water, the waves  
above become remarkably smooth.

The incident which first drew Franklin’s attention  
to this subject he thus narrates :—‘ In 1757, being at  
sea in a fleet of ninety-six sail bound against Louis-  
bourg, I observed the wakes of two of the ships to be  
remarkably smooth, while all the others were ruffled  
by the wind, which blew fresh. Being puzzled with  
the differing appearance, I at last pointed it out to our  
captain, and asked him the meaning of it. ‘The cooks,’  
said he, ‘ have, I sup , been just emptying their  
greasy water through the scuppers, which has greased  
the sides of those ships a little!’ and this answer he  
gave me with an air of some little contempt, as toa  
person ignorant of what everybody else knew. In my

He showed that organised structure had nothing to do  
with the matter, for he produced similar movements  
by placing on the surface of water small oiled chips  
cut into the form of a comma (,); as the oil issued from  
the point of the comma, the chips began to rotate.  
  
The explanation which Franklin offered of the seda-  
tive effect of the oil upon waves is very ingenious. Air,  
when in motion, in the shape of wind, over the surface  
of smooth water, probably rubs, as it were, on that sur-  
face, and raises it into wrinkles, which, if the wind con-  
tinues, are the elements of future waves. The smallest  
wave, once raised, does not immediately subside and  
leave the neighbouring water quiet; but in subsiding  
raises nearly as much of the water next to it, in the  
same way as a stone dropped into water raises a series  
of concentric waves axound it. As a small power  
continually in operation will produce a great effect, so  
the small first-raised waves, being continually acted  
on by the wind, are, though the wind does not increase  
in strength, continually increased in magnitude, rising  
higher and extending their basis, so as to includea  
vast mass of water in each wave, which in its motion  
acts with great violence. This being the mode i

repulsive power which drives the particles of oil one  
from another, extending them into a film of the  
greatest possible tenuity. “ Now,” says he, “I ima-  
gine that the wind blowing over water thus covered  
with a fiim of oil cannot easily catch upon it, so as to  
raise the first wrinkles, but slides over it, and leaves it  
smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil, indeed,  
which, being between it and the water, serves it to  
slide with, and prevents friction, as oil does between  
those parts of a machine that would otherwise rub hard  
together. Hence the oil dropped on the windward  
side of a pond proceeds gradually to leeward, as may  
be seen by the smoothness it carries with it, quite to the  
opposite side ; for the wind being thus prevented from  
raising the first wrinkles, that I call the elements of  
waves, cannot produce waves, and thus the whole  
pond is calmed.”*

“ In 1757, being at sea in a fleet of ninety­  
six sail bound for Louisbourg, I observed the  
wakes of two of the ships to be remarkably  
smooth, while all the others were ruffled by  
the wind, which blew fresh. Being puzzled  
with the differing appearance, I at last point­  
ed it out to our captain, and asked him the  
meaning of it. ‘ The cooks,’ said he, &#x27;‘have,  
I suppose, been just emptying their greasy  
water through the scuppers, which has  
greased the sides of those ships a little;” and  
this answer he gave me with an air of some  
little contempt, as to a person ignorant of  
what everybody else knew. In my own  
mind I at first slighted his solution, though I  
was not able to think of another.

Transactions. After dropping a little oil  
inte the water, he states :  
“ I saw it spread itself with surprising  
swiftness upon the surface, but the effect of  
smoothing the waves was not produced ; for  
I had applied it first upon the leeward side  
of the pond, where the waves were largest,&#x27;  
and the wind drove my oil back upon the  
shore. I then went to the windward side,  
where they began to form ; and there the oil  
though not more than a tea-spoonful, produc­  
ed an istant calm over a space several yards  
square, which spread amazingly, and extend­  
ed itself gradually till it reached the lee-side  
making all that quarter of the pond, perhaps  
half an acre, as smooth as a looking glass.

“ I imagine,” says Franklin, accounting for  
the effect, “that the wind blowing over the

easily catch upon it, so as to raise the first

anchored about a quarter of a mile from theshore.  
A barge plied to windward of the long boat, as  
far from her as she was from the shore, making  
trips of about half a mile each ; oil being contin-  
ually poured from her, out of a large stone bot-  
tle, through a hole in the cork about as large as  
a goose quill. A party of observers placed them-  
selves on the shore, in a position to note if any  
change were produced in the surf by the action  
of the oil. Franklin did not find the effect upon  
the surf to be so great as he expected ; but the  
persons in the long-boat could observe a tract of  
smooth water the whole length of the distance  
on which the oil was poured, gradually spreading  
in breadth towards the long-boat. This water  
was smooth, but not actually level. The swell  
continued ; but the surface was not ruffled by  
wrinkles or smaller waves ; and there were none  
of the waves called by sailors “white caps’

ledge of one who had great aptitude for ferreting out  
the causes of thin mjamin Franklin. What he  
did and what he thought on the subject were after-  
wards placed upon record in the sixty-fourth volume  
of the Prt ical Transactions. How his attention  
became first di to the matter, he thus tells us:  
  
‘In 1757, being at sea, in a fleet of ninety-six sail, | face  
  
bound ibourg, I observed the wakes of  
two of the ships to be remarkably smooth, while all

meaning of it. “The cooks,” said he, “ have, I suppose,  
been just emptying their greasy water thro the  
sew which have greased the sides of those ships  
a little.” And this answer he gave me with an air of  
some little contempt, as to a person ignorant of what  
every else knew. In my own mind, I at first  
slighted his solution, though I was not able to think  
of another.’ In after-years, the circumstance came to  
his recollection, corroborated by many facts which had  
been communicated to him, and he resolved, thoroughly  
hilosopher as he was, to find out really  
does smooth the waves, and why it does so.  
The first thing he did was to make an iment  
in a pond on Clapham Common. He dropped « litle

Ww the waves were largest, and the wind drove m  
oil back upon the shore. I then went to the wind-  
ward-side, where they began to form ; and there the  
oil, though not more than a teaspoonful, produced an  
instant calm over a surface several yards square,  
which spread amazingly, and extended itself gradu-  
ally till it reached the lee-side, making all the quarter  
of the pond—perhaps half an acre—as smooth as a  
looking-glass.’ If —— figures ay cea, thi

continues, become the parents of other waves. Every  
wave, when once formed, instead of subsiding into per-  
fect quietness, subsides only to force up a neighbouring  
portion of water to an equal height—in the same way  
as a stone dropped into water raises a series of  
concentric waves around it. The small first-raised  
waves, being continually acted upon by the wind, are  
—even though the wind may not increase in strength  
—continually increased in magnitude, rising higher and  
extending their basis, so as to include a vast mass of

into a film of exquisite tenuity. ‘I imagine,’ he says,  
‘that the wind blowing over water thus covered  
with a film of oil cannot easily catch upon it, so as to  
raise the first wrinkles, but shdes over it, and leaves  
it smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil,  
indeed, which, being between it and the water, serves  
it to slide with, and prevents friction, as oil does  
between those parts of a machine that would other-  
wise rub hard pp Hence the oil dro on  
the windward-side of a pond proceeds ually to  
leeward, as may be seen by the smoothness it carries  
with it, quite to the opposite side ; for the wind bein  
thus prevented from raising the first wrinkles, whic  
I call the elements of waves, cannot produce the  
waves themselves; and thus the whole pond is  
calmed.’ The experiment at Portsmouth shewed  
that oil has not the effect of destroying the waves  
themselves: it reduces them to calm and gently  
swelling undulations. When the wind blows fresh,  
there are continually rising on the back of every great  
wave a number of small waves, which roughen its  
surface, and give the wind a kind of hold or purchase

it is by this the fishermen know where  
to find them. The fisherman at Gibral­

the sea in order to still its motion, that  
they may be enabled to see the oysters ly­

of oil into the sea which suppresses the

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ON THE USE OF OIL  
AT SEA.  
  
Dr Benjamin Franklin was a believer in what  
has been frequently pointed out in this Journal,  
namely, the power of oil to still the agitation of  
water, and he records several experiments as the  
ground of his belief. In a letter to Dr Brownrigg  
in 1773, he mentions that in 1757 he observed the  
wakes of two ships to be remarkably smooth,  
while the wakes of all the others were ruffled by  
the wind, which blew fresh. The captain of  
Franklin’s ship explained this by supposing that  
the cooks of the two ships had been emptying  
their greasy water through the scuppers. He was  
informed by fellow-passengers that the Bermu-  
dians when they would strike fish, the Lisbon  
fishermen when the surf was high on the bar, and  
Mediterranean divers when the rufiling of th

that herring-fishers could see at a distance where  
shoals of herring were by the smoothness of the  
water over them ; the erent being that some  
oiliness proceeded from the bodies of the herrings.  
The other story was that the harbour of Newport,  
Rhode Island, was observed to be always smooth  
while any whaling-vessels were in it. Franklin  
goes on to say that he showed his experiment to  
Count Bentinck of Holland, his son Captain  
Bentinck, and Professor Allemand, on ‘a large  
piece of water at the head of the Green Park ;’ and  
that the Count said he had received a letter from  
Batavia relative to the saving of a Dutch ship

half a mile from the shore, on a windy day. The  
experiment was but partially successful, since no  
material difference was observed in the height or  
force of the surf upon the shore; but there was  
a long tract of smoothed, not level water ; ‘and a  
wherry, on her way to Portsmouth, seemed to turn  
into that tract of choice, and to use it from end  
to end, as a piece of turnpike road.’ Franklin  
accounted for the want of complete success in this  
instance, by conjecturing that the mechanical force  
of the waves already raised by the wind must go  
on until exhausted, as a pendulum continues to  
swing after the original impulse has been with-  
drawn. He held, however, that the oil diminished  
the action of the wind on the waves already raised,  
  
and that it prevented the wind from raising new  
waves, He seems to accept Pliny’s statement, that  
the seamen of his time stilled the waves by pour-  
ing oil into the sea; and he adds: ‘It has been of  
late too much the mode to slight the learning of  
the ancients. The learned, too, are apt to slight  
too much the knowledge of the vulgar. The cool-  
ing by evaporation was long an instance of the  
latter. This art of smoothing the waves by oil is  
an instance of both.’

they had descended to a certain depth they allowed the  
  
escape of the oil, which, rising to the surface by virtue of |  
  
its lightness, spread in a thin film, which smoothed the  
water rippies and allowed light to descend to a considerable  
depth. The fishermen of Lisbon, when about to return into  
the river, it they saw before them too great a surf upon the  
bar, were accustomed to empty a bottle or two of oil into

Franklin thus narrates: ‘‘ In 1757, being at sea in a fleet  
of ninety-six sail, bound against Louisbourg, I observed the  
wakes of twe of the ships to be remarkably smooth, while  
all the others were ruffied by the wind, which blew fresh.  
Being puzzled with the differing appearance, I at last  
pointed it out to our captain, and asked him the meaning of  
it. ‘The cooks,’ said he, ‘have, I suppose, been just  
emptying their greasy weter through the scuppers, which  
  
hus greased the sides of those ships a little !’ and this an- |  
  
swer he gave me with an air of some little contempt, as to a)

shall be glad to have an authentic account of  
the Keswick experiment, and, if it comes up to  
the representations that have been made of it,  
Ishall not much hesitate to believe the old  
gentleman in another more wonderful phenom-  
enon he relates, of stilling a tempest only by  
tbrowing up a iittle vinegar into the air.  
  
Extract of a letter to Dr. Brownrigg, from  
Dr. Franklin, dated Landon, November 7th  
1773.  
  
Dear Sir—I thank you for the remarks of  
your learned friend at Carlisle. I had when  
@ youth, read and smiled ct Pliny’s  
account of a practice among seamen of  
his time, to still the wavos in a otorm  
by pouring oil into the sea, which he men-  
tions, as well as the uso made of oil by  
the diver; but the stilling a tempest by throw-  
ing vinegar intothe air had escaped me. I  
think, with your friend, that it has been of late  
too much the mode to slight the learning of the  
Ancients. The learned, too, are apt to slight  
too much the knowledge of the vulgar.  
  
The cooling by evaporation was long an in-  
tance of the latter. This art of smoothing the  
waves bylfoil is an instance of both,  
  
” + * * * . *  
  
In 1757, being at sea in a fleet of ninety-six  
sail bound against Louisbourg,I observed the  
wakes of two of the ships to be remark-  
ably smooth, while all the others were ruffied  
by the wind, which blewfresh. Being puzzled  
with the different appearance, I at last pointed  
it out to our captain, and asked him the jmecan-  
ing of it. “The cooks,” says he, “have, I sup-  
pose, been just emptying their greasy water  
through the scuppers, which has greased the  
sides of those ships a little.” At this answer  
he gave me with an air of some little contempt,  
astoa person ignorant of what everybody  
else knew. In my own mind, I at first slighted  
his solution, though I was not able to think of  
another; but recollecting what I had formerly  
read in Pliny, I resolved to make some experi-  
ment of the effect of oil on water, when I  
should hare onn-rtunity.

An old sea captain told me he had heard it  
was 1 practice with the fishermen of Lisbon,  
when about to return into the river (if they saw  
before them too great a surf upon the bar,  
which they apprehended might fill their boats  
in passing), to empty a bottle or two of oil into  
the sea, which would suppress the breakers and  
allow them to pass safely.  
  
A confirmation of thisI have not since had  
an opportunity of obtaining; but, discoursing  
of it with another person, who had often been  
in the Mediterranean, I was informed that the  
divers there, who, when under water in their  
business, need light, which the curling of the  
surface interrupts by refractions of so many  
little waves, let a smal! quantity of oil now and  
then out of their mouths, which, rising to the  
surface, smooths it,and permits the light to  
come down to them. All these informations I  
at times revolved in my mind, and wondered to  
find nomention of them in our books of ex-  
perimental philosophy.  
  
At length, being at Clapham, where there is,  
on the common, &amp; large pond, which I observed  
one day to be very rough with the wind,I  
fetched out a little cruet of oil and dropped a  
little of it on the water. Isaw it spread itself  
with surprising swiftness upon the surface, but  
the effect of smoothing the waves was not pro-  
duced, for I had applied it first on the leeward  
side of the pond, where the waves were largest,  
and the wind drove my oil back upon the shore.  
I then went to the windward side, where they  
began to form; and there the oil, though not  
more than a teaspoonful produced an instant  
calm over &amp; space several yards square, which  
spread amazingly, and extonded itecif gradually  
till it reached the lee side, making all that  
quarter of the pond, perhaps half and acre, as  
smooth as a looking-glass,  
  
After this I contrivod to take with mo, when-  
ever I went into the country, a littie oil in the  
upper hollow joint of my bamboo cane, with  
which I might repeat the experiment as oppor-  
tunity should offer, and I found it constantly  
to sueceed.  
  
In those experiments, one circumstance  
struck me with particular surprise. This was  
the sudden, wide and forciblo spreading of a  
drop of oil on the face of the watcr, whioh I  
do not know that anybody hag hitherto con-  
sidered.  
  
If a drop of oil is put on a highly polished  
marble table, or On a looking glass that lies  
horizontally, the drop remains in its place,  
spreading very little. But, when put on the  
water, it spreads instantly many feet roundc  
bocoming so thin asto produce the prismati-  
colors, for a considerable space, and boyond  
them so much thinner as to be invisible, oxcept  
in ita cffect of emoothing the waves at a much  
greater distance.  
  
It seems as if a mutual repulsion between its  
particles took place as soon as it touched the  
water, and a repulsion so strong as to act on  
other bodies swimming on the surface, as  
straw, leaves, etc., forcing them to rocede every  
way from the drop, as from a center, leaving a  
large, clear space.  
  
The quantity of this ferce,and the distance |  
  
to which it will operate, Ihave not yet ascer-  
tained; but I think ita curious inquiry, and |  
wish to understand whence it arises.

Our friend, Sir John Pringle, being soon  
after in Scotland, learned there, that those em-  
ployed in the herring fishery could at s dis-  
tance see where the shoals of herrings were,  
by the smoothness of the water over them,  
which might possibly be occasioned, he  
thought, by some oiliness proceeding from  
their bodies. A gentleman from Rhode Island  
told me it had been remarked that the harbor  
of Newport was ever smooth while any whal-  
ing vessels wore in it, which probably arose  
from henee, that the blubber which they  
sometimes bring looge in the hold, or the loak-  
age of their barrels, might afford somo oil, to  
mix with thet weter, which from time to time  
they pump ont, to keep their vessel free, and  
that some oil might spread over the surface of  
the water in the harbor, and prevent the form-  
ing of any waves.  
  
This prevention I would thus endeavor to  
explain:  
  
There seems to be no natural repulsion be-  
tween water and air, such as to keep them  
from coming into contact with each other.  
Hence we find a quantity of air in water, and if  
we extract it by means of the air pump, the  
same water, again exposed to the air, will soon  
imbibe an equal quantity.  
  
Therefore, air in motion, which is wind, in  
passing over the smooth surface of water, may  
rub, as it were, upon that surface and raise it  
in wrinkles, which, if the wind continues, are  
the elements of future waves.

Thus, the small, first-raised waves, being con-  
tinually acted upon by the wind, are, though  
the wind does not increase in strength, con-  
tinually increased in magnitude, rising higher  
and extending their bases,so as to include a  
vast mass of water in each wave, which, in its  
motion, acts with great violence.  
  
But if there be a mutual repulsion between  
the particles of oil, and no attraction between  
oil and water, oil dropped on water will not be  
held together by adhesion to the spot whereon  
it falls; it will not beimbibed by the water; it  
will be at liberty to expand itself; and it will  
spread on a surface that, besides being smooth  
to the most perfect degree of polish, prevents,  
perbaps by repelling the oil, all immediate con-  
  
  
  
tact, keeping it at a minute distance from  
itself; and the expansion will continue until the  
mutual repulsion between the particles of the  
oil is weakened and reduced to nothing by their  
distance.  
  
Now, I imagine that the wind, blowing over  
watar thus covered by a film of oil, cannot  
easily catch upon it,co as to raise the first  
wrinkles, but slides over it, and leaves it as  
smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil  
indeed, which, being between it and the water,  
serves it to slide with, and prevents friction, as  
oil does between those parts of a machine that  
would otherwise rub hard together,  
  
Hence, the oil dropped on the windward side  
of a pond proceeds gradually to leeward, as  
may be seen by the smoothness it carrie3 with  
it, quite to the opposite side. Fer the wind  
being thus prevented from raising! the first  
wrinkles—that I call the elements of a wave—  
cannot produce waves, which are to be made  
by continually acting upon and enlarging those  
elements, and thus the whole pond is calmed.  
  
Totally, therefore, we might suppress the  
waves in any required place, if we could come  
at the windward place where they take their  
rise. This, in the ocean, can seldom if ever be  
done. But perhaps something may be done on  
particular oceasions to moderate the violence  
of the waves when we are in the midst of  
them, and prevent their breaking, where that  
would be inconvenient.  
  
For, when the wind blows fresh, there are  
continually rising on the back of every great  
wave a number of small ones, which roughen  
ita surface and give the wind hold, as it were,  
to push it with greater force. This hold is di-  
minished by preventing the generation of  
those smail ones. And possibly, too, when a  
wave’s surface is oiled, the wind in passing  
over it may rather in some degree press it  
down, and contribute to prevent its rising  
again, instead of promoting it. This, as mere  
conjecture, would have little weight if the  
apparent effects of pouring oil into the midst  
of waves were not considerable, and as yet not  
otherwise accounted for.  
  
When the wind blows so fresh as that the  
waves are not sufficiently quick in obeying its  
impulse; their tops, being thinner and lighter,  
are pushed forward, broken, and turned over  
ina white foam. Common waves lift a vessel  
without entering it; but these, when large,  
sometimes break above and pour over it, doing  
great damage.  
  
But that this effect might in any degree be  
prevented, or the height and violence of waves  
in the sea moderated, we had no certain ac-  
count, Pliny’s authority for the practice of  
seamen in his time being slighted.  
  
Diseoursing lately on this subject with his  
excellency, Count Bentinck of Holland, his  
son, the Honorable Capt. Bentinck, and the  
learned professor, Allemand, a letter was men-  
tioned which had been received by the Count  
from Batavia, relative to the saving of a Dutch  
ship in a storm, by pouring oilinto the sea, I  
much desired to see that letter, and a copy of it  
was promised me, which I afterward received.

Franklin, being at sea in a fleet of ninety­  
six sail bound for Louisburg, observed the  
wakus of two of the ships to be remarkably  
smooth, while all the others were ruffled by  
the wind, which blew&#x27; fresh. Being puzzled,  
tie doctor at last pointed it out to the Cap­

&quot;The cooks,” said he, “have, 1 suppose,

To an acute mind like that of Franklin,  
this amounted well nigh to a revelation . An

thought little of it and told the doctor that  
It was a practice with the fishermen of Lis­  
bon, whon too great a surf swept the bar, to  
empty a bottle or two of oil into the sea,  
which would at once suppress the breakers  
and allow the crow to enter the river.  
Another gentleman from Rhode Island

 that when seals  
were devouring a very oily fish under water (which they fre-  
quently do) the waves above became remarkably smooth ;  
and at Newport, in Rhode Island, the sea was generally  
found to be smooth while any whaling ships were in the  
harbor, from which it was inferred that the leakage from  
the oil-barrels had been pumped up with the bilge-water  
from the holds of the ships and emptied into the ocean.  
  
Now, some of these facts came to the knowledge of that  
great inductive philosopher, Benjamin Franklin; and how  
his attention became first directed to the matter he has  
himself told us: ‘“ In 1757, being at sea, in a fleet of ninety-  
six sail, bound against Louisbourg, I observed the wakes  
of two of the ships to be remarkably smooth, while all the  
others were ruffled by the wind, which blew fresh. Being  
puzzled with the differing appearance, I at last pointed it  
out to our captain and asked him the meaning of it. ‘The  
cooks,’ said he, ‘ have, I suppose, been just emptying their  
greasy water through the scuppers, which has greased the  
sides of those ships a little.” And this answer he gave me  
with an air of some little contempt. In my own mind I  
at first slighted his solution, though I was not able to think  
of another.”  
  
But in after years the circumstance recurred to Frank-  
lin, corroborated by many other facts, and he resolved to  
find out whether oil really does smooth the waves, and why  
it does so. The first thing he did was to make an experi

ment on a pond at Clapham Common (London). He  
dropped a little oil on the water. ‘‘I saw it spread itself,”  
he says, “ with surprising swiftness upon the surface, but  
the effect of smoothing the waves was not produced, for I  
had applied it first upon the leeward side of the pond,  
where the waves were largest, and the wind drove my oil  
back upon the shore. I then went to the windward side,  
where they began to form; and there the oil, though not  
more than a teaspoonful, produced an instant calm over a  
surface several yards square, which spread amazingly and  
extended itself gradually till it reached the lee side, making  
all the quarter of the pond—perhaps half an acre—as  
smooth as a looking-glass.”  
  
His next experiment consisted in the use of a bamboo  
walking-stick, into the upper joint of which he put a little  
oil whenever he was about to walk into the country. This  
enabled him to confirm the result of the former experiment  
over and over again. On one occasion, while on a visit  
to Smeaton, the engineer, Franklin was told by Jessop,  
who afterwards became eminent in the same walk of life,  
that some flies, drowned ina cup of oil, were seen to rotate  
and move about as if alive. Franklin having before ob-  
served that a film of oil on the surface of water seemed to  
have a sort of

At length being at Clapham, where there is, on  
the common, a large pond, which I observed one  
day to be very rough with the wind, I fetched out  
a cruet of oil, and dropped a little of it on the  
water. I saw it spread itself with surprising  
swiftness upon the surface; but the effect of  
smoothing the waves was not produced; for I had  
applied it first on the leeward side of the pond,  
where the waves were greatest; and the wind  
drove my oil back upon the shore. I then went to  
the windward side where they began to forin; and  
there the oil, though not more than a teaspoonful,  
produced an instant calm over a space several  
yards square, which spread amazingly, and ex-  
tended itself gradually till it reached the lee side,  
making all that quarter of the pond, perhaps half  
an acre, as smooth as a looking-glass. After this  
I contrived to take with me, whenever I went into  
the country, a little oil in the upper hollow joint  
of my bamboo cane, with which I might repeat the  
experiment as opportunity should offer, and I found  
it constantly to succeed.
