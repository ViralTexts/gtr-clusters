carefully off with a very dry and warm  
rag. The thin coat of paraffine left  
adhering to the metal after this process  
will notbe perceptible to the eye ;  
being solid, it does not leave the  
greasy feeling that remains when oil or  
tallow has been used ; it does not  
affect in the slightest degree the

would prove excellent for the pro-

small quantities in the bones of all ani­
