Dear Sir  
Passy, April 22d. 1784  
  
I received your’s of the 15th. Instant, and the Memorial it inclosed. The account they give of your situation grieves me. I send you herewith a Bill for Ten Louis d’ors. I do not pretend to give such a Sum. I only lend it to you. When you shall return to your Country with a good Character, you cannot fail of getting into some Business that will in time enable you to pay all your Debts: In that Case, when you meet with another honest Man in similar Distress, you must pay me by lending this Sum to him; enjoyning him to discharge the Debt by a like operation when he shall be able and shall meet with such another opportunity.— I hope it may thus go thro’ many hands before it meets with a  
  
Knave that will stop its Progress. This is a Trick of mine for doing a deal of good with a little money. I am not rich enough to afford much in good works and so am obliged to be cunning and make the most of a little.— With best wishes for the success of your Memorial and your future prosperity, I am, Dear Sir, Your most obdt. Servt.

April 22, 1784i:,I sond you horo a bill  
for ton Louis d&#x27; or. I do not pretond to  
givo such a sum j I only lend it to you.  
When you shall return to your country  
you cannot fail of getting into somo  
businoss that will in timo enable you  
to&#x27; pay all your dobts. In that caso,  
whon you moot with, another honest man  
in similar distross, you must pay mo by  
lending this sum to him, enjoining him  
to discliargo tlio ddbt by liko  
operation whon ho shall bo able, and  
shall moot with such another  
opportunity. I hopo it may thus go  
through many hands before it meets with  
a knavo to stop its progress. This is a  
trick of mine for doing a good doal of  
good with a littlo inorjoy, I am not  
rich onougli to afford much in good  
work, and am so obliged to bo earning  
aud mako tho most of a little.
