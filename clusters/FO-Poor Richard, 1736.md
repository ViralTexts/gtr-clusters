Loving Readers,  
  
Your kind Acceptance of my former Labours, has encouraged me to continue writing, tho’ the general Approbation you have been so good as to favour me with, has excited the Envy of some, and drawn upon me the Malice of others. These Ill-willers of mine, despited at the great Reputation I gain’d by exactly predicting another Man’s Death, have endeavour’d to deprive me of it all at once in the most effectual Manner, by reporting that I my self was never alive. They say in short, That there is no such a Man as I am; and have spread this Notion so thoroughly in the Country, that I have been frequently told it to my Face by those that don’t know me. This is not civil Treatment, to endeavour to deprive me of my very Being, and reduce me to a Non-entity in the Opinion of the publick. But so long as I know my self to walk about, eat, drink and sleep, I am satisfied that there is really such a Man as I am, whatever they may say to the contrary: And the World may be satisfied likewise; for if there were no such Man as I am, how is it possible I should appear publickly to hundreds of People, as I have done for several Years past, in print? I need not, indeed, have taken any Notice of so idle a Report, if it had not been for the sake of my Printer, to whom my Enemies are pleased to ascribe my Productions; and who it seems is as unwilling to father my Offspring, as I am to lose the Credit of it. Therefore to clear him entirely, as well as to vindicate my own Honour, I make this publick and serious Declaration, which I desire may be believed, to wit, That what I have written heretofore, and do now write, neither was nor is written by any other Man or Men, Person or Persons whatsoever. Those who are not satisfied with this, must needs be very unreasonable.  
My Performance for this Year follows; it submits itself, kind Reader, to thy Censure, but hopes for thy Candor, to forgive its Faults. It devotes itself entirely to thy Service, and will serve thee faithfully: And if it has the good Fortune to please its Master, ’tis Gratification enough for the Labour of Poor  
  
R. Saunders  
  
Presumptuous Man! the Reason wouldst thou find  
Why form’d so weak, so little, and so blind?  
First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess  
Why form’d no weaker, blinder, and no less?  
Ask of thy Mother Earth, why Oaks are made,  
Taller or stronger than the Weeds they shade?  
Or ask of yonder argent Fields above,  
Why Jove’s Satellites are less than Jove?  
  
XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.  
  
Some have learnt many Tricks of sly Evasion,  
Instead of Truth they use Equivocation,  
And eke it out with mental Reservation,  
Which to good Men is an Abomination.  
Our Smith of late most wonderfully swore,  
That whilst he breathed he would drink no more;  
But since, I know his Meaning, for I think  
He meant he would not breath whilst he did drink.  
  
He is no clown that drives the plow, but he that doth clownish things.  
If you know how to spend less than you get, you have the Philosophers-Stone.  
The good Paymaster is Lord of another man’s Purse.  
Fish and Visitors stink in 3 days.

He that has neither fools, whores nor beggars among his kindred, is the son of a thunder gust.  
Diligence is the Mother of Good-Luck.  
He that lives upon Hope, dies farting.  
Do not do that which you would not have known.  
I Mon. March hath xxxi days.  
  
Whate’er’s desired, Knowledge, Fame, or Pelf,  
Not one will change his Neighbour with himself.  
The learn’d are happy Nature to explore,  
The Fool is happy that he knows no more.  
The Rich are happy in the Plenty given;  
The Poor contents him with the Care of Heav’n.  
Thus does some Comfort ev’ry State attend,  
And Pride’s bestow’d on all, a common Friend.  
  
Never praise your Cyder, Horse, or Bedfellow.  
Wealth is not his that has it, but his that enjoys it.  
Tis easy to see, hard to foresee.  
In a discreet man’s mouth, a publick thing is private.  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
  
By nought is Man from Beast distinguished  
More than by Knowledge in his learned Head.  
Then Youth improve thy Time, but cautious see  
That what thou learnest some how useful be.  
Each Day improving, Solon waxed old;  
For Time he knew was better far than Gold:  
Fortune might give him Gold which would decay,  
But Fortune cannot give him Yesterday.

Things that are bitter, bitterrer than Gall  
Physicians say are always physical:  
Now Women’s Tongues if into Powder beaten,  
May in a Potion or a Pill be eaten,  
And as there’s nought more bitter, I do muse,  
That Women’s Tongues in Physick they ne’er use.  
My self and others who lead restless Lives,  
Would spare that bitter Member of our Wives.  
  
He that can have Patience, can have what he will.  
Now I’ve a sheep and a cow, every body bids me good morrow.  
God helps them that help themselves.  
Why does the blind man’s wife paint herself?  
V Mon. July hath xxxi days.  
  
Who can charge Ebrio with Thirst of Wealth?  
See he consumes his Money, Time and Health,  
In drunken Frolicks which will all confound,  
Neglects his Farm, forgets to till his Ground,  
His Stock grows less that might be kept with ease;  
In nought but Guts and Debts he finds Encrease.  
In Town reels as if he’d shove down each Wall,  
Yet Walls must stand, poor Soul, or he must fall.  
  
None preaches better than the ant, and she says nothing.  
The absent are never without fault, nor the present without excuse.  
Gifts burst rocks.  
  
If wind blows on you thro’ a hole,  
Make your will and take care of your soul.  
  
The rotten Apple spoils his Companion.  
VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.  
  
The Tongue was once a Servant to the Heart,  
And what it gave she freely did impart;  
But now Hypocrisy is grown so strong  
The Heart’s become a Servant to the Tongue.  
Virtue we praise, but practise not her good,  
(Athenian-like), we act not what we know,  
As many Men do talk of Robin Hood  
Who never did shoot Arrow in his Bow.  
  
He that sells upon trust, loses many friends, and always wants money.  
  
Don’t throw stones at your neighbours, if your own windows are glass.  
The excellency of hogs is fatness, of men virtue.  
Good wives and good plantations are made by good husbands.  
Pox take you, is no curse to some people.  
VII Mon. September hath xxx days.

When you are sick, what you like best is to be chosen for a Medicine in the first Place; what Experience tells you is best, is to be chosen in the second Place; what Reason (i.e. Theory) says is best, is to be chosen in the last Place. But if you can get Dr. Inclination, Dr. Experience and Dr. Reason to hold a Consultation together, they will give you the best Advice that can be given.  
God heals, and the Doctor takes the Fees.

1. Before the middle of this Year, a Wind at N. East will arise, during which the Water of the Sea and Rivers will be in such a manner raised, that great part of the Towns of Boston, Newport, New-York, Philadelphia, the low Lands of Maryland and Virginia, and the Town of Charlstown in South Carolina, will be under Water. Happy will it be for the Sugar and Salt, standing in the Cellars of those Places, if there be tight Roofs and Cielings overhead; otherwise, without being a Conjurer, a Man may easily foretel that such Commodities will receive Damage.  
2. About the middle of the Year, great Numbers of Vessels fully laden will be taken out of the Ports aforesaid, by a Power with which we are not now at War, and whose Forces shall not be descried or seen either coming or going. But in the End this may not be disadvantageous to those Places.

Lovixe Reapers.—Your kind acceptance of  
my former labours has encouraged me to contin-  
ue writing, tho’ the general approbation you  
have been so good as to favor me with, has ex-  
cited the envy of some, and drawn upon me the  
malice of others. These i&#x27;l-willers of mine, des-  
pited at the great reputation I gain’d by exactly  
predicting another mau’s death, bave endeavoured  
to deprive me of it all at once in the most effect-  
ual manner, by reporting that | myself was never  
alive. They say, in short, that there is no such a  
man as Iam: and have spread this notion so  
thorough.!y in the country, that | have been fre-  
quently told itto my face by those that don’t know  
me. ‘hi; is not civil treatment, to endeavour to  
deprive me of my very being, and reduce meto a  
uva-entity in the opinion of the pubiick. But  
so long as I know myself to walk about, eat,  
irink and sleep, J am satisfied that there ts reallg  
such a man as I am, whatever they may say to  
‘he contrary. And the world may be satisfied  
‘ikewise, for if there was no such a man as [ ain  
how is it possible I should appear publickly te  
uundreds of people, as | have done for several  
years past, in print? I need not, indeed, have  
taken any notice of so idle a report, if it had not  
been for the sake of my printer, to whom my:  
enemies are pleased to ascribe my productions ;  
and who it seems is as unwilling to father my  
offspring as I am to lose the credit of it. — There-  
fore, to clear him entirely, as well as to vindicate  
my own honour, I make this publjck and serious  
declaration, which I desire may be believed, to  
wit: That what I have written heretofore, and do  
now write, neither was, nor is written by any other  
man or men, person or persons, whatsoever. ‘Those  
who are not satisfied with this, must needs be  
very unreasonable.

after she passed through the shadow she  
became more and moro bright till she  
required her full lustre. This was occa-  
sioned by a part of the sun&#x27;s rays being  
ob-structed, by, in fact, a partial  
eclipso of the sun at the lunar surface  
called the penumbra. The contact of the  
moon with the penumbra began nearly an  
hour before itacontact with tho shadow,  
and though not noticeable at first, the  
diminution of light caused by it was  
very marked some minutes before the  
first contact with the shadow. All lunar  
eclipses are universal-that is, visible  
at the same instant in all parts of the  
earth which have the moon above their  
horizon, and everywhere of the same  
magni-tude and duration. To obtain the  
time of first contact by our dooks it  
was simply necessary to add 10 hours to  
the Groonwicli time of the phenomenon as  
given in tim nautical almanac. The timo  
of &#x27;first contact by this calcu-lation  
was 10.33, as I had stated before-hand,  
and this &#x27;timo was confirmed by several  
observers. Tho eastern side of the moon,

from the north, is that which first

of this is that tne proper mo ion of the
