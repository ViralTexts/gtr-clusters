Thou, too, sail on, O ship of State!  
Sail on, O Union, strong and great!  
Humanity, with all its fears,  
With all the hopes of future years,  
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!  
We know what master laid thy keel,  
What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,  
Who made each mast, each sail, each rope,  
What anvils sang, what hammers beat,  
In what a forge and what a heat,  
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!  
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,  
&#x27;Tis of the wave and not the rock;  
&#x27;Tis but the flapping of the sail,  
And not a rent made by the gale!  
In spite of rock and tempest&#x27;s roar,  
In spite of false lights on the shore,  
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!  
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee:  
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, tears,  
Are all with thee—are all with thee!

sall on, sall on, oh ship of State  
Sail on, oh Union, strong and great;  
Humanity, with all its fears,  
With all its hopes of future years,  
hanging breathless on thy fate  
we know what master laid thy keel;  
what workman wrought thy ribs of steel  
Who made each mast, each sail, each rope  
What anvils rang, what hammers beat;  
what a forge and what a heat  
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope.  
Fear not each sudden sound and shock  
Tis of the wave and not the rock,  
but the flapping of the sail,  
And not a rent made by  
  
the  
  
gale!  
  
  
  
of rock and tempest roar  
pite of faise lights on the shore;  
en-nor feaf to breast the sea!  
 Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,

in-  
  
lumphant o&#x27;er our fears,  
  
 Are all with thee; are all with thee!
