Sail on, O Union, strong and great!  
Humanity, with all its fears,  
With all the hopes of future years,  
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!  
We know what master laid thy keel,  
What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,  
Who made each mast, each sail, each rope,  
What anvils sang, what hammers beat,  
In what a forge and what a heat,  
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!  
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,  
&#x27;Tis of the wave and not the rock;  
&#x27;Tis but the flapping of the sail,  
And not a rent made by the gale!  
In spite of rock and tempest&#x27;s roar,  
In spite of false lights on the shore,  
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!  
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee:  
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, tears,  
Are all with thee—are all with thee
