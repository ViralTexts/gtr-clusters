me, we will divide our selves as near as may be to be equally helpful; and such of us as may be spared shall assist others. And to prevent as much as in us lies, suspicious persons from coming into, or carrying any Goods out of such Houses as may be in Danger; Two of our Number shall constantly attend at the Doors, untill all the Goods and Effects that can be saved, are packed up and carried to some safe place to be appointed by the Owner, or such of our Company as shall be present, where one or more of us shall attend them ’till they can be conveniently delivered to or secured for the Owner. And upon our first hearing the Cry of Fire in the Night-time we will immediately cause two or more Lights to be set up in our Windows; and such of our Company whose Houses may be thought in Danger shall likewise place Candles in every Room, to prevent Confusion, and that their Friends may be able to give them the more speedy and effectual Assistance. And, moreover, as this Association is intended for a general Benefit, we do further agree, that when a Fire breaks out in any part of this City, though none of our Houses Goods or Effects may be in any apparent Danger, we will nevertheless repair thither with our Buckets, Bags and Fire Hooks, and give our utmost Assistance to such of our Fellow Citizens as may stand in need of it, in the same Manner as if they belonged to this Company: And if it shall appear at the next meeting of the Company after the breaking out of any Fire in this City, that any of our Members neglected to attend, with their Buckets, Bags and Fire hooks, or set up Lights as aforesaid, every such neglecting Member shall forfeit and pay to the use of the Company the sum of Two Shillings; unless they can assign some reasonable Cause to the Satisfaction of the Company
