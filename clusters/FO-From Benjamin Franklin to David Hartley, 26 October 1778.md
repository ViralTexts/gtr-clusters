 and Welfare, and her own Ingratitude.  
  
Young Jamie loved me well  
And sought me for his Bride  
But saving ane Crown  
He had nothing beside  
To make that Crown a Pound  
My Jamie gang’d to Sea  
And the Crown and the Pound  
Were all for me.  
  
Her Grief for their Separation is expressed very pathetically  
  
The Ship was a Wrack  
Why did not Jennie dee  
O why was I spared  
To cry Wae is me.  
  
There is no Doubt but that honest Jammie had still so much Love for her as to Pity her in his Heart, tho’ he might at the same time be not a little angry with her.

een all the Parties.  
Your Commissioners are acting very indiscreetly in America. They first spoke disrespectfully of our good Ally. They have since called in question the power of Congress to treat with them; and have endeavour’d to begin a Dispute about the detention of Bourgoynes Troops; an Affair which I conceive not to be within their Commission. They are vainly trying by Publications to excite the People against the Congress. Governor Jonston has been attempting to bribe the Members; and without the least Regard to Truth has asserted three Propostions which he says, he will undertake to prove; The two first of them I know to be false and I believe the third to be so. The Congress have refused to treat with the Commissioners while he continues one of them, and he has therefore resigned. These Gentlemen do not appear well qualify’d for their Business. I think they will never heal the Breach; but they may widen it.
