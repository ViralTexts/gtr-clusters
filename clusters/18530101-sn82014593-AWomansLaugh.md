Such persons are to be pitied; for laughter in grown people is a substitute devised by nature for the screams and shouts of boyhood, by which the lungs are strengthened and the health preserved. As the intellect ripens, shouting ceases, and we learn to laught as we learn to reason.  
  
A woman has no natural grace more bewitching than a sweet laugh. It is like the sound of flutes on water. It leaps from her heart in a clear, sparkling rill ; and the heart that hears it feels as if bathed in the exhilerating spring. Have you ever pushed an unseen fugitive through the trees, led on by her fairy laugh now here, now there, now lost, now found ? ; We have. - And we are pursuing the wandering voice to this day. Sometimes it comes to us in the midst of care, or sorrow, or irksome business ; and then we turn away and listen, and hear it rinsing through the room like a silver bell, with power to scare away the ill-spirits of the mind.
