Praise Yonr Wife.  
Praise your wife, man ; for pity’s sake give

She has made your home comfortable, your

There are many women to-day thirsting lor  
ho word of praise, the language of encourage­

know that if the floor is clean, manual labor has  
been performed to make it so. Tou know that  
if you can take from your draw a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, somebody’s fingers have  
ached in the toil of making it so fresh and n­  
greeablo, so smooth and lustrous. Everything  
that please the eye and the sense has been pro­  
duced by constant work, much thought, great  
care, and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appreciate  
these things, and feel a glow of gratitude for  
rhe numberless attentions bestowed upon them  
in sickness and in health, but they are so selfish  
in that feeling. They don’t come out with a  
a hearty, “Why, how pleasant you make things

constant work, much thought, great care and  
untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appreciate

truth.  
  
Soon or late to all our dwellings come the spectres of  
the mind,  
  
Doubts and fears and dread forebodings, in the dark  
peas dim-defined ;  
  
Round us threng the deep projections of the heart and  
of the brain,  
  
And our pride of strength is weakness, and the cun-  
ning hand is vain.  
  
Ia the dark we cry like children; and no answer from  
on high  
  
Breaks the crystal spheres of silence, and no white  
wings downward fly ;  
  
But the heav- nly help we pray for comes to faith and  
not to sight,  
  
And our prayers themselves drive backward ali the  
spirits of the night!

PRAISE YOUR WIFE.  
  
Praise your wife, man; for pity’s sake, give |  
  
her a little eacouragement—it won’t hurt her.  
  
She bas made your home comfortable, your |  
  
hearth brigtt and shining, your food agree-  
able; for pity’s sake, tell her you thank her,  
if nothing more. She don&#x27;t expect it—it will  
mske ber eyes open wider than they have done  
for these ten years; but it willdo her good,  
for all that, and you, too.  
  
There are many wemen, to day, thirsting for  
the word of praise, the language of encourage.  
ment. Through summer’s heat and winter&#x27;s  
toll they have drudged uncomplainingly ; and  
so accustomed have their fathers, brothers, and  
husbands become to their monotonous labors,  
that they look for and upon them as they do

down. Homely everyday life may be made  
beautiful by the appreciation of its very home-  
liness. You kaow that if the floor is clean,  
manual labor has been performed to make it  
so. You know, if you can take a clean shirt  
from your drawer whenever you want it, some-  
body’s fingers have ached in the toil of making  
it so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lus  
trous. Everything that pleases the eye and  
the sense has been produced by constant work,  
much thought, great care, and untiring efforts,  
bodily and mentally.  
  
Is it not that many men do not appreciate  
these thirgs, and feel a flow of gratitude for  
the numberless attentions bestowed upon them  
in sickness and health, that they are so selfish  
in their feeling? They don’t come out with a  
hearty, “‘ Why, how pleasant you make things  
look, wife;’”? or, “I am obliged to you for  
taking so much pains.’’ They thank the tailor  
for giving them &lt;&lt; fits ;”’? they thank the man in  
the full omnibus who gives them a seat; they  
thank the young lady who moves along in the  
concert-room; in short, they thank everybody  
and everything out of doors, because it is  
the custom, and come home, tip their chairs  
back, and their heads up, pull out the news-  
paper, grumble if wife asks them to take the  
baby, scold if the fire has gone down; or, if  
everything is just right, shut their mouth with  
a smack of satisfaction, but never say to her,  
‘¢] thaak you.”’  
  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if you  
did but show an ordinary civility towards those  
common articles of housekeeping—your wires ;  
if you gave the one hundred and sixtieth part  
of the compliments you almost choked them  
with before they were married; if you would  
stop the badinage about whom you are going to  
have when number one is dead, (such things  
wives may laugh at, but they sink deep some-  
times;) if you would cease to speak of their  
faults, however banteringly, before others—  
fewer women would seek for other sources of  
happiness than your cold, so so ish affection.  
Praise your wife, then, for all good qualities  
ste has, and you may rest assuced that her  
deficiencies are fully counterdalanced by your  
gwn.’’

will do Iter good for all that, and you too.  
There are many women to-day thirsting  
for the word of praise, the language of eo­

Hoinely. every day life may be made  
beautiful by an appreciation of its very  
houteliness. You know that if the floor is

make it so. You know that if you can take

smooth ad lustrous. Every thing that  
pleases the eye and the sense has been pro­

treat care, and untirii g efforts, bodily and  
mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appreci­  
ate these things, and feel a glow of grati­  
tude for the numberless attentions bestow­  
ed upon them in sickness and health, but  
they are so selfish in thut feeling. They  
don&#x27;t come out with a hearty Why, how  
pleasant you make thing- look, wife;&quot; nr  
&quot;I am obliged to yu for takiag so much

tbem &quot;tit;&quot; they thank the man in the full  
omnibus who gives them a seat; they thank  
the young lady who maves along in the  
concert room ; in short, they thank every­  
body and everything out of doors, because  
it is custom, and come home, tip their  
chairs back and their heels up, pull out the  
newspaper, grumble if wife asks them to  
take the buby. scold if the fire has g.tt  
down; or. if everything is just right, shut  
their mouths with a smack of satisfaction,  
but never say to her &quot;I thank you.&quot;

Praise Your Wife.  
  
Praise your wife, man; for pity’s sake  
give her a little encouragement; it won’t  
hurt her. She has made your home  
comfortable, your heart bright, your  
lood agreeable; for pity’s sake tell her  
you thank her, if nothing more. She  
don’t expect it; it will make her eyes  
open wider than they have for these  
last ten years; but it will do her good  
tor all that and you, too.  
There are many women to-day thirst­  
ing for a word of praise—the language  
of encouragement. Through summer’s  
heat and winter’s toil they have drud­  
ged uncomplainingly, and so accustom­  
ed have their fathers, brothers, and  
husbands become to their labors, that  
they look for and upon them as they do  
the daily rising of the sun and its daily  
going down. You know that if the  
door is clean, labor has been performed  
to make it so. You know that if you  
can take from the drawer a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, somebody’s  
lingers have toiled. Everything that  
pleases the eye and sense has been pro­  
duced by work, thought, care and ef­  
forts, bodily and mental.  
Many men appreciate these things  
and feel gratitude for the numberless  
attentions bestowed upon them in sick­  
ness and health; why don’t they come  
out with a hearty. “Why, how pleas­  
ant you make things look, wife,” or “1  
am obliged to you for taking so much  
pains.” They thank the tailor for a  
good tit; they thank the man in the  
horse car, who gives them a seat; they  
thank the young lady who moves  
along in the concert room; in short they  
thank everybody and everything out­  
of-doors, and come home, tip their  
chairs hack and their heels up, pull out  
the newspaper, scold if the fire has gone  
down; or if everything is just right,  
shut their mouths with a smack of  
satisfaction, but never say “1 thank  
you.”  
I tell you what, men, young and old,  
if you did but show the ordinary civil­  
ity toward your wives; if you gave one  
hundred and sixtieth part of the com­  
pliments you almost choked them be­  
fore they were married; if you would  
stop the badinage about whom you are  
going to have when the number one  
is dead (such things wives may laugh  
at, but they sink deep, sometimes); if  
you would cease to speak of their  
faults, however banteringly, before  
others—fewer women would seek for  
other sources of happiness. Praise  
your wife, then, for all her good quali­  
ties, and you may rest assured that her  
deficiencies are no greater than you
