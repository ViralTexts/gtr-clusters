Praise your wife, man ; for pity&#x27;s sake give her a little encouragement; it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has made your home comfortable, your health  
bright and shining, your food agreea­ble ; for pity&#x27;s sake tell her you

There are many women to-day thirsting for the word of praise, the language of encouragement. Through summer s heat and winter s toil they have drudged­ uncomplainingly, and so accustomed have their fathers, brothers and husbands become to their montonous labors, that they look for and upon them so they do the daily rising of the sun and its daily going down. Homely, every day life may be mad beautiful by an appreciation of its very homeliness You know that if the floor is clean, manual labor has been performed to make it so. You know that if you can take from your drawer a clean shirt whenever you &#x27;rant it, somebody&#x27;s fingers have ached ii the toil of making it so fresh and agreeable, s smooth and lustrous. Every thing that pleases the eye and the sense has been produced by constant work, much through great care, and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
  
It is not that many men do not appreciate these things, and feel a glow of gratitude for the numberless attentions bestowed upon them in sickness and in health, but they are so selfish in that feeling They don&#x27;t come out with hearty &quot;Why, how pleasant you make things look, wife ; I am obliged to you for taking so much pains.&quot; They thank the tailor for giving them &quot;fits ;&quot; they thank the man in the full omnibus who gives them a seat; they thank, the young lady who moves along in the concert room ; in short, they thank everybody and everything out of doors, because it is the custom, and come home, tip their chairs back and their heels up, pull out the newspaper, grumble if wife asks them  
to take the baby, scold if the fire has&#x27;got down ; or, if everything is just right, shut their mouths with a smack of satisfaction, but never say to her &quot;I thank you.&quot;  
  
I tell you what, men ; young and old, if you did but show an ordinary civility towards these common articles of house-keeping, your wives ; if you gave the one hundred and sixtieth part of the com­pliments you almost choked them with before the; were married ; if you would stop the badinage about whom you are going to have when number one is dead, (such things wives may laugh at but they sink deep sometimes :) if you would cease to speak o&#x27; their faults, however banteringly, before others, fewer women would seek? for other sources of happiness that your cold, so-so-ish affection.

Praise Yonr Wife.  
Praise your wife, man ; for pity’s sake give  
her a little encouragement; it won’t hurt her.  
She has made your home comfortable, your

•yes open wider than they have for these ten

There are many women to-day thirsting lor  
ho word of praise, the language of encourage­  
nent. Through summer’s heat and winter’s*  
oil they have drudged uncomplainingly, and so  
iccustoined have their father*, brothers, and  
uisbands become to their monotonous labors,

Homely every day life may be made beautiful  
by an appreciation of its very homeliness. You  
know that if the floor is clean, manual labor has  
been performed to make it so. Tou know that  
if you can take from your draw a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, somebody’s fingers have  
ached in the toil of making it so fresh and n­  
greeablo, so smooth and lustrous. Everything  
that please the eye and the sense has been pro­  
duced by constant work, much thought, great  
care, and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appreciate  
these things, and feel a glow of gratitude for  
rhe numberless attentions bestowed upon them  
in sickness and in health, but they are so selfish  
in that feeling. They don’t come out with a  
a hearty, “Why, how pleasant you make things  
look, wife;” or, “I am obliged to you for taking  
so much pains.” They thank the tailor for giv­  
ing them “fits;” they &quot;thank the man in full ora­  
nibns who gives them a seat; they thank the  
young lady who moves along in the concert­  
room ; in short, they thank everybody and ev­  
erything out of doors, because it it the custom,  
and come home, tip their chairs back and their  
heels up, pall out the newspaper, grumble if wife  
asks them to take to the baby, scold if the fire  
ima got down ; or, if everything is just right,]  
shut their mouths with a mock satisfaction, but  
never to say to her “1 thank you.&quot;  
I tell you what, tnen, young and old, if you  
did but show an ordinary civility towards those  
common articles of house-keeping, your wives;  
if yon gave the one hundred and sixtieth part of  
the compliments you almost choked them with

Praise Your Wife.  
  
Praise your wife, man; for pity’s sake  
give her a little encouragement; it won’t  
hurt her. She has made your home  
comfortable, your heart bright, your  
lood agreeable; for pity’s sake tell her  
you thank her, if nothing more. She  
don’t expect it; it will make her eyes  
open wider than they have for these  
last ten years; but it will do her good  
tor all that and you, too.  
There are many women to-day thirst­  
ing for a word of praise—the language  
of encouragement. Through summer’s  
heat and winter’s toil they have drud­  
ged uncomplainingly, and so accustom­  
ed have their fathers, brothers, and  
husbands become to their labors, that  
they look for and upon them as they do  
the daily rising of the sun and its daily  
going down. You know that if the  
door is clean, labor has been performed  
to make it so. You know that if you  
can take from the drawer a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, somebody’s  
lingers have toiled. Everything that  
pleases the eye and sense has been pro­  
duced by work, thought, care and ef­  
forts, bodily and mental.  
Many men appreciate these things  
and feel gratitude for the numberless  
attentions bestowed upon them in sick­  
ness and health; why don’t they come  
out with a hearty. “Why, how pleas­  
ant you make things look, wife,” or “1  
am obliged to you for taking so much  
pains.” They thank the tailor for a  
good tit; they thank the man in the  
horse car, who gives them a seat; they  
thank the young lady who moves  
along in the concert room; in short they  
thank everybody and everything out­  
of-doors, and come home, tip their  
chairs hack and their heels up, pull out  
the newspaper, scold if the fire has gone  
down; or if everything is just right,  
shut their mouths with a smack of  
satisfaction, but never say “1 thank  
you.”  
I tell you what, men, young and old,  
if you did but show the ordinary civil­  
ity toward your wives; if you gave one  
hundred and sixtieth part of the com­  
pliments you almost choked them be­  
fore they were married; if you would  
stop the badinage about whom you are  
going to have when the number one  
is dead (such things wives may laugh  
at, but they sink deep, sometimes); if  
you would cease to speak of their  
faults, however banteringly, before  
others—fewer women would seek for  
other sources of happiness. Praise  
your wife, then, for all her good quali­  
ties, and you may rest assured that her  
deficiencies are no greater than you
