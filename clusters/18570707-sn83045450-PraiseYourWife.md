Praise your wife, man ; for pity&#x27;s sake give her a little encouragement; it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has made your home comfortable, your health  
bright and shining, your food agreea­ble ; for pity&#x27;s sake tell her you  
thank her, if noth­ing more. She don&#x27;t expect it ; it will make her eyes open wider than they have for these ten years ; but it will do her good for all that, and you too.  
  
There are many women to-day thirsting for the word of praise, the language of encouragement. Through summer s heat and winter s toil they have drudged­ uncomplainingly, and so accustomed have their fathers, brothers and husbands become to their montonous labors, that they look for and upon them so they do the daily rising of the sun and its daily going down. Homely, every day life may be mad beautiful by an appreciation of its very homeliness You know that if the floor is clean, manual labor has been performed to make it so. You know that if you can take from your drawer a clean shirt whenever you &#x27;rant it, somebody&#x27;s fingers have ached ii the toil of making it so fresh and agreeable, s smooth and lustrous. Every thing that pleases the eye and the sense has been produced by constant work, much through great care, and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
  
It is not that many men do not appreciate these things, and feel a glow of gratitude for the numberless attentions bestowed upon them in sickness and in health, but they are so selfish in that feeling They don&#x27;t come out with hearty &quot;Why, how pleasant you make things look, wife ; I am obliged to you for taking so much pains.&quot; They thank the tailor for giving them &quot;fits ;&quot; they thank the man in the full omnibus who gives them a seat; they thank, the young lady who moves along in the concert room ; in short, they thank everybody and everything out of doors, because it is the custom, and come home, tip their chairs back and their heels up, pull out the newspaper, grumble if wife asks them  
to take the baby, scold if the fire has&#x27;got down ; or, if everything is just right, shut their mouths with a smack of satisfaction, but never say to her &quot;I thank you.&quot;  
  
I tell you what, men ; young and old, if you did but show an ordinary civility towards these common articles of house-keeping, your wives ; if you gave the one hundred and sixtieth part of the com­pliments you almost choked them with before the; were married ; if you would stop the badinage about whom you are going to have when number one is dead, (such things wives may laugh at but they sink deep sometimes :) if you would cease to speak o&#x27; their faults, however banteringly, before others, fewer women would seek? for other sources of happiness that your cold, so-so-ish affection. Praise your wife, then, for all good qualities she has. and you may rest assured that her deficiencies are fully coun­terbalanced by your own.

truth.  
  
Soon or late to all our dwellings come the spectres of  
the mind,  
  
Doubts and fears and dread forebodings, in the dark  
peas dim-defined ;  
  
Round us threng the deep projections of the heart and  
of the brain,  
  
And our pride of strength is weakness, and the cun-  
ning hand is vain.  
  
Ia the dark we cry like children; and no answer from  
on high  
  
Breaks the crystal spheres of silence, and no white  
wings downward fly ;  
  
But the heav- nly help we pray for comes to faith and  
not to sight,  
  
And our prayers themselves drive backward ali the  
spirits of the night!

PRAISE YOUR WIFE.  
  
Praise your wife, man; for pity’s sake, give |  
  
her a little eacouragement—it won’t hurt her.  
  
She bas made your home comfortable, your |  
  
hearth brigtt and shining, your food agree-  
able; for pity’s sake, tell her you thank her,  
if nothing more. She don&#x27;t expect it—it will  
mske ber eyes open wider than they have done  
for these ten years; but it willdo her good,  
for all that, and you, too.  
  
There are many wemen, to day, thirsting for  
the word of praise, the language of encourage.  
ment. Through summer’s heat and winter&#x27;s  
toll they have drudged uncomplainingly ; and  
so accustomed have their fathers, brothers, and  
husbands become to their monotonous labors,  
that they look for and upon them as they do  
the daily rising of the sun and its daily going  
down. Homely everyday life may be made  
beautiful by the appreciation of its very home-  
liness. You kaow that if the floor is clean,  
manual labor has been performed to make it  
so. You know, if you can take a clean shirt  
from your drawer whenever you want it, some-  
body’s fingers have ached in the toil of making  
it so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lus  
trous. Everything that pleases the eye and  
the sense has been produced by constant work,  
much thought, great care, and untiring efforts,  
bodily and mentally.  
  
Is it not that many men do not appreciate  
these thirgs, and feel a flow of gratitude for  
the numberless attentions bestowed upon them  
in sickness and health, that they are so selfish  
in their feeling? They don’t come out with a  
hearty, “‘ Why, how pleasant you make things  
look, wife;’”? or, “I am obliged to you for  
taking so much pains.’’ They thank the tailor  
for giving them &lt;&lt; fits ;”’? they thank the man in  
the full omnibus who gives them a seat; they  
thank the young lady who moves along in the  
concert-room; in short, they thank everybody  
and everything out of doors, because it is  
the custom, and come home, tip their chairs  
back, and their heads up, pull out the news-  
paper, grumble if wife asks them to take the  
baby, scold if the fire has gone down; or, if  
everything is just right, shut their mouth with  
a smack of satisfaction, but never say to her,  
‘¢] thaak you.”’  
  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if you  
did but show an ordinary civility towards those  
common articles of housekeeping—your wires ;  
if you gave the one hundred and sixtieth part  
of the compliments you almost choked them  
with before they were married; if you would  
stop the badinage about whom you are going to  
have when number one is dead, (such things  
wives may laugh at, but they sink deep some-  
times;) if you would cease to speak of their  
faults, however banteringly, before others—  
fewer women would seek for other sources of  
happiness than your cold, so so ish affection.  
Praise your wife, then, for all good qualities  
ste has, and you may rest assuced that her  
deficiencies are fully counterdalanced by your  
gwn.’’

Iiaise Your Wife.  
Praise your wife, men ; for pity&#x27;s sake,  
give her a little encouragement it won&#x27;t  
hurt her. She has made your home com­  
fortable, your hearth bright and shining,  
your food agreeable. For pity&#x27;s sake, tell  
her that you thank her, if nothing more.  
She don&#x27;t expect it; it will make her eyes  
open wider than they have for these ten  
years ; but it will do her good for all that,  
and you, too.  
There are many women to-day thirsting  
for the word of praise, the language of  
encouragement. Through summer&#x27;s heat  
and winter&#x27;s toil they have drudged un­  
complainingly ; and so accustomed have  
their fathers, brothers and husbands be­  
come to their monotonous labors, that  
they look for and upon them as they do  
upon the daily rising of the sun and its  
daily going down. Homely every-day life  
may be beautiful by an appreciation of its  
very homliness. You know that if the  
floor is clean, manual labor has been per­  
formed to make it so. You know that if  
you can take from your drawer a clean  
shirt whenever you want it, somebody&#x27;s  
fingers have ached in the toil of making it  
so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lus­  
trous. Everything that pleases the eye  
and the sense has been produced by con­  
stant work, much thought, great care aud  
untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appre­  
ciate these things, and feel a glow of grat­  
itude for numberless attentions bestowed  
upon them iu sickness and in health; but  
they are so selfish in that feeling. They  
don&#x27;t come out with a heart-, &quot;Why how  
pleasant you make things look, wife,&quot; or,  
&quot;I am obliged to you for taking so much  
pains.&quot; They thank the tailor for giving  
them HUsj&quot; they thank the man iu the  
full omnibus who gives them a seat ; they  
thank the young lady who moves along in  
the concert room ; in short, they thank  
everybody and evcrj&#x27;thing out of doors,  
because it is the custom ; and they come  
home, tip the chairs back and their heels  
up, pull out the newspaper, grumble if  
wife asks them to take the baby, scold if  
the fire has got down ; or, if everything is  
just right, shut their mouths with a smack  
of satisfaction, but never say to her, &#x27;I  
thank you.&quot;  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if  
you did but show an ordinary civility to­  
ward those common articles of housekeep­  
ing, 3&#x27;our wives; if you gave the one hun­  
dred and sixtieth part of the compliments  
you almost choked them with before they

badinage about who you are going to have  
wheu number one is dead, (such things  
wives may laugh at, but they sink deep,  
sometimes;) if you would cease to speak  
of their faults, however banteringly, be­  
fore others, fewer women would seek for  
other sources of happiness than your cold  
so-so-ish affection. 1&#x27;raise your wife, then,

Now, in God&#x27;s Heaven of Holy Love,  
Shriven of all her guile.  
Softly the pillows the old man&#x27;s head  
On her bosom of driven snow,  
Whispering tales of the olden time,  
Of the buried long ago.  
Faint, from the tall cathedral spire,  
Cometh a feeble shout;  
Heavenly now are the brazen bells  
Ringing the old year out.  
Gently his dream is fading away,  
The little ones all have flown;  
Yet not for a wearily passing year.  
Is he left upon earth alone.  
The bells that are ringing the old year out,  
Toll for the sexton dead,  
Lying upon the marble cold,  
Where he pillowed his weary head.

Praise your wife, man?do, for pity&#x27;s sake,  
give her a little encouragement. You may  
be assured it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has made  
your house comfortable, your hearth bright  
and shining, your food agreeable; for pity&#x27;s  
sake, tell her you thank her, if nothing more.  
She don&#x27;t expect it. It will make her eyes  
open wider than thev have been for this ten  
years, but it will do her good for all that, and  
you, too.  
There are many women to-day thirsting  
for the word of praise, the language of encouragement.  
Through summer&#x27;s heat, through  
winter&#x27;s cold, they have drudged uncomplainingly,  
and so accustomed are their fathers,  
brothers and husbands become to their monotonous  
labors, that they look for and upon  
them as they do the daily rising of the sun  
and its daily going down.  
Homely, every-day life may be made beautiful  
by an appreciation of its very homeliness.  
You are aware that, if the floor is clean,  
manual labor has been performed to make it  
so. You know that, if you can take from  
your drawer a clean shirt whenever you want  
it, somebody&#x27;s Angers have ached in the toil  
of making it so fresh and agreeable, so smoth  
and lustrous. Everything that pleases the  
eye and the sense has been produced by constant  
work, much thought, great care and untiring  
efforts, bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appreciate  
these things and feel a glow of gratitude for  
the numberless attentions bestowed upon them  
in sickness and in health, but they are so selAsh  
in that feeling. They don&#x27;t come out

ness and health; why don’t they come  
out with a hearty. “Why, how pleas­  
ant you make things look, wife,” or “1  
am obliged to you for taking so much  
pains.” They thank the tailor for a  
good tit; they thank the man in the  
horse car, who gives them a seat; they  
thank the young lady who moves  
along in the concert room; in short they  
thank everybody and everything out­  
of-doors, and come home, tip their  
chairs hack and their heels up, pull out  
the newspaper, scold if the fire has gone  
down; or if everything is just right,  
shut their mouths with a smack of  
satisfaction, but never say “1 thank  
you.”  
I tell you what, men, young and old,

ity toward your wives; if you gave one  
hundred and sixtieth part of the com­  
pliments you almost choked them be­

going to have when the number one

at, but they sink deep, sometimes); if  
you would cease to speak of their  
faults, however banteringly, before

Praise your wife, man; for pity&#x27;s

the eye and the sense has been pro­  
duced by work, thought, care, and  
efforts, bodily and mental.  
Many men appreciate these things,  
and feel gratitude for the number­  
less attentions bestowed upon them  
in sickness and health; why don’t  
they come out with a hearty “Why,  
how pleasant you make things look,

taking so much pains.” They thank  
the tailor for a good fit; they thank

For Husbands to Read.  
Praise your wife, ma.i; for pity’s  
sake give her a little encourage­  
ment; it won’t hurt her. She don’t  
expect it, it will make her eyes open  
wider than they have the last ten  
years; but it will do her good for all  
that, and you, too. There are many  
women today thirsting for a  
word of praise—the language of en­  
couragement. You know that if  
the floor is clean, labor has been  
performed to make it so. You  
know that it you can take from  
your drawer a clean shirt whenever  
you want it somebody’s lingers have  
toiled. Why don’t you come out  
with a hearty &quot;Why how pleasant  
you make t hings look, wife.” If you  
gave one hundredth or even one  
sixtieth part of the compliments  
you almost chocked with before you  
were, married; if you would stop the  
badinage about whom you are going  
to have when number one is dead  
(such tilings wives may laugh at,  
but they sink deep sometimes), few­
