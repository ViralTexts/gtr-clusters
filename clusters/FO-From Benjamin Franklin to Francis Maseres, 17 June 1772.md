Cravenstreet, June 17. 1772  
I thank you for the Pamphlet proposing to establish Life Annuities in Parishes, &amp;c. I think it an excellent one. In compliance with your Wish, pag. 25, 26 I send it back with a few Marginal Notes (perhaps of no great Importance) made in Reading it, requesting it may be return’d to me.  
In page 118 of Dr. Price’s Book on Annuities, 2d Edition, you will find mention made of an Institution in Holland. He had that Information from me. Those Houses are handsome neat Buildings with very comfortable Apartments, some form the sides of a Square, with Grass Plats and Gravel Walks, Flowers, &amp;c. and some have little separate Gardens behind each Apartment. Those for Men are called Oude Mannen Huyzen, for Women, Oude Vrouwen Huyzen. I think the different kinds sometimes make different Sides of the same Square. There is a Chappel for Prayers, a common Kitchen, and a common Hall in which they dine together. Two Persons such as best like one another, and chuse so to associate, are generally lodg’d in one Apartment, tho’ in separate Beds, that they may be at hand to assist each other in case of sudden Illness in the Night, and otherwise be mutually helpful. The Directors have also a Room to meet in, who form Rules for the Government of the House, hear Complaints, and rectify what is amiss. Gentlemen are Directors of the Oude Mannen Huys, Ladies of the Oude Vrouwen Haus. A Committee of Two are chosen every Year; who visit often, see the Rules observed, and take care of the Management. At the End of the Year, these are thank’d off, and as an honourable Memorial of their Service, their Names with the Year they served are added to the Gold-letter List on the Walls of the Room. All the Furniture is neat and Convenient, the Beds and Rooms kept clean and sweet by the Servants of the House; and the People appear to live happily.  
These Institutions seem calculated to prevent Poverty which is rather a better thing than relieving it. For it keeps always in the Public Eye a State of Comfort and Repose in old Age, with Freedom from Care, held forth as an Encouragement to so much Industry and Frugality in Youth as may at least serve to raise the required Sum, (suppose £50,) that is to intitle a Man or Woman at 50 to a Retreat in these Houses. And in acquiring this Sum, Habits may be acquired that produce such Affluence before that Age arrives as to make the Retreat unnecessary and so never claimed. Hence if £50 would (as by your Table) entitle a Man at 50 Years of Age to an Annuity of £19 3s. 6½d., I suppose that in such a House, Entertainment and Accommodations to a much greater Value might be afforded him; because the Right to live there is not transferrable, and therefore every unclaim’d Right is an Advantage to the House, while Annuities would probably all be claimed. Then it seems to me that the Prospect of a distant Annuity will not be so influencing on the Minds of young People, as the constant View of the Comfort enjoy’d in those Houses, in comparison of which even the Payment and Receipt of the Annuities are private Transactions.  
I write this in hopes you will after Consideration favour me with your Opinion whether (in Addition to your Plan, which will still have all its Advantage for small [sums?]) one or more such Houses in every County, would not probably be of great Use in still farther promoting Industry and Frugality among the lower People, and of course lessening the weight of the Poor Tax?

** CRAVEN STREET, June 17,  
“Str: Ithank you for the Pamphlets pro-  
sing to establish Life Annuities in Parishes,  
I think it an excellent one. In compli-  
ance with your wish, pages 25, 26, I send it  
ack with a few marginal notes (perhaps of  
0 great importance), made in reading it, re-  
lesting it may be returned to me.  
“In page 118 of Dr. Price’s Book on An-  
nuities, 2d Edition, you will find mention  
ade of an Institution in Holland. He had  
that information from me. Those Houses are  
handsome neat buildings, with very comfort-  
able Apartments; some form the sides of a  
square, with grass plats, and gravel walks,

flowers, &amp;c., and some have little separate  
gardens behind each Apartment. ‘Those for  
men are called Oude Mannen Huysen,; for  
women, Oude Vrouwen Huysen. 1 think the  
different kinds sometimes make different sides  
of the same square. ‘There is a Chapel for  
prayers, a common kitchen, and a common  
hall in which they dine together. Two per-  
sons, such as best like one another, and choose  
so to associate, are generally lodged in one  
apartment, tho’ in separate beds, that they  
may be at hand to assist each other in case  
of sudden illness in the night, and otherwise  
be mutually helpful.  
  
“The Directors have also a room to meet  
in, who form rules for the government of the  
House, hear complaints and rectify what is  
amiss. Gentlemen are Directors of the Oude  
Mannen Huys, Ladies of the Oude Vrouwen  
Haus. A committee of two are chosen every  
year, who visit often, see the rules observed,  
and take care of the management. At the  
end of the year, these are thanked off, and as  
an Honourable Memorial of their services,  
their names, with the year they served,  
added to the Gold Letter List on the walls  
of the room. All the furniture is neat and  
convenient, the beds and rooms kept clean  
and sweet by the Servants of the House; and  
the People appear to live happily.  
  
“ These Institutions seem calculated to pre-  
vent poverty, which is rather a better thing  
than Relieving it. For it keeps always in the  
Public Eye a state of comfort and repose in  
old age with freedom from care held forth as  
an encouragement to so much industry and  
frugality in youth as may at least  
raise the required sum (suppose / 50) that  
is to intitle a man or woman at 50 to a  
Retreat in those Houses. And in acquiring  
this sum habits may be acquired that produce  
such affluence before that age arrives as to  
make the retreat never  
claimed. Hence, if #50 would (as by your  
table) entitle a man at 50 years of age to an  
annuity of £19. 3. 6. 1-2, I suppose that [in]  
such a House entertainment and accommo  
dations to a much greater value might be af-  
forded him ; because the nght to live there is  
not transferable, and therefore every unclaimed  
right is an advantage to the House, whil  
Annuities would probably all be claimed.  
Then it seems to me that the prospect of a  
distant annuity will not be so influencing on  
the minds of young people, as the constant  
view of the comfort enjoyed in t  
in comparison of which even the /a)  
and Receipft of the annuities are private  
actions.

eration favor me with your opinion whether
