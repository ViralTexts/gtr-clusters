cap. 26. Preamble. Albeit the Dominion and Principality of Wales is and ever hath been united to and under the Imperial Crown of this Realm, whereof his Majesty is very Head, nevertheless because in the Principality divers rights, usages and laws are far discrepant from the Laws and Customs of this Realm, and also because the] People of that Dominion [have a speech not consonant to the natural Mother Tongue] used in this Realm.  
  
[And] some ignorant People made a Dis[tinction between the King’s] Subjects of the Realm and his Subjects of [Wales]  
[His] Highness therefore  
[Of his] Love to his Subjects of the Principality,  
[And to] bring the Subjects of his Realm and those of his [Dominion] to Concord and Unity.  
[By the] Advice of Lords and Commons, and Authority of the same hath enacted, that henceforth  
[The] said Country or Dominion of Wales shall be incorporated with his Realm of England.  
[It] seems clear, that before this Act, Wales was not under[stood as] within the Realm, tho’ subject to the same Prince. [And was] Subject to the Crown, tho’ not to the Parliament.  
[To sub]ject it to Laws made by the Latter it was thought [right?] to give it all the “Freedoms, Liberties, RIGHTS [and Laws], that the King’s Subjects naturally born within this [Realm had] and enjoy’d.”  
[And] among the rest § 29 the Right of sending Knights [and Burg]esses to Parliament.  
[The Sta]tute of the 34th and 35th. Hen. 8. cap. 13. Preamble sets forth, [that the] County Palatine of Chester had hitherto been excluded [from the] high Court of Parliament, to have any Knights and Burgesses [in the] said Court  
By Reason whereof  
[It] had sustained manifold Disherisons, Losses and Damages as well in [their Lands, Goods, and Bodies as in the good government of the Commonwealth of the country, and have been bound by the Statutes and yet had no Knights] or Burges[ses in the Court of Parliament for the said County Palatine, the inhabitants for] lack thereof have [often been touched and grieved with Acts and] Statutes made within the s[aid Court, as well derogatory unto the most] ancient Privileges and Liberties, and p[rejudicial to the common We]alth, quietness, rest, and Peace of the King’[s Subjects inha]biting within the same.  
  
For Remedy whereof  
It is enacted that the County of Chester [shall have] two Knights, and

The method taken by the advisers of Henry was to give his

quarrels betweeen them; to prevent which io future, the king “ofa -
