I have the Pleasure of informing you that it is propos’d to give you the Command of the great Ship we have built at Amsterdam. By what you wrote to us formerly, I have ventur’d to say in your Behalf, that this Proposition would be agreable to you. You will immediately let me know your Resolution: which that you may be more clear in taking, I must inform you of some Circumstances. She is at present the Property of the King, but as there is no War yet declar’d, you will have the Commission and Flag of the States, and act under their Orders and Laws. The Prince de Nassau will make the cruize with you. She is to be brought here under Cover as a French Merchantman; to be equipp’d and mann’d in France.

The other Commissioners are not acquainted with this Proposition as yet, and you see by the Nature of it that it is necessary to be kept a Secret till we have got the Vessel here, for fear of Difficulties in Holland, and Interception
