. “We had four houses in this city, and a vessel at one of the wharfs, struck and damaged by lightning last summer; one of the houses was struck twice in the same storm. But I have the pleasure to inform you, that our method of preventing such terrible disasters has, by a fact which like to have escaped our knowledge, given a very convincing proof of its great utility, and is now in higher repute with us than ever.  
“Hearing a few days ago, that Mr. William West merchant in this city, suspected that the lightning, in one of the thunderstorms last summer, had passed through the iron conductor which he had provided for the security of his house, I waited on him to inquire what ground he might have for such a suspicion. Mr. West informed me, that his family and neighbours were all stunned with a very terrible explosion, and that the flash and crack were seen and heard at the same instant; whence he concluded that the lightning must have been very near; and as no house in the neighbourhood had suffered by it, that it must have passed through his conductor. Mr. White, his clerk, told me, that he was sitting at the time by a window about two feet distant from the conductor, leaning against the brick-wall, with which it was in contact, and that he felt a smart sensation like an electric shock in that part of his body which touched the wall. Mr. West farther informed me, that a person of undoubted veracity assured him, that being in a door of an opposite house on the other side of the street, he saw the lightning diffused over the pavement, which was then very wet with rain, to the distance of two or three yards from the foot of the conductor: And that another person of very good credit told him, that he, being a very few doors off, on the other side of the street, saw the lightning above, darting in such direction, that it appeared to him to be directly over that pointed rod.  
“Upon receiving this information, and being desirous of farther satisfaction, there being no traces of the lightning to be discovered in the conductor, as far as we could examine it below, I proposed to Mr. West our going to the top of the house to examine the painted [pointed] rod; assuring him, that if the lightning had passed through it, the point must have been melted: And, to our great satisfaction, found it so. This iron rod extended in height about 9 feet and an half above a stack of chimneys to which it was fixed; it was somewhat more than half an inch diameter in the thickest part, and tapering to the upper end. The conductor, from the lower end of it to the earth, consisted of square iron nail rods, not much above a quarter of an inch thick, connected together by interlinking joints. It extended down the cedar roof to the eaves, and from thence down the wall of the house, four stories and a half, to the pavement, in Water-street, being fastened to the wall in several places by small iron hooks. The lower end was fixed to a ring in the top of an iron stake that was down about 4 or 5 feet into the ground. The above mentioned iron rod had a hole in the top of it, about two inches deep, wherein was inserted a brass-wire about two lines thick, and, when first put there, about ten inches long, terminating in a very acute point; but now its whole length is no more than seven inches and a half, and the top very blunt. Some of the metal appears to be missing, the slenderest part of the wire being, as I suspect, consumed into smoke. But some of it, where the wire was a little thicker, being only melted by the lightning, sunk down while in a fluid state, and formed a rough irregular cap, lower on one side than the other, round the upper end of what remained, and became intimately united therewith.  
“This was all the damage that Mr. West sustained by a terrible stroke of lightning. A most convincing proof of the great utility of this method of preventing its dreadful effects.

our knowlege, given a very convincing proof of its great uti-  
lity, and is now in higher repute with us than ever,  
  
¢ Hearing afew days ago, that Mr, William Weft, Mer-  
chant in this city, fufpected that the lightning, in one of the  
thunder-ftorms laft f{ummer, had pafled through the iron con-  
duftor, which he had provided for the fecurity of his houfe, I

flafh and crack were feen and heard at the fame inftant: whence  
he concluded, that the lightning muft have been very near ; and  
as na houfe in the neighbourhood had fuffered by it, that it muft

which it was in contact; and that he felt a fmart fenfation,  
like an electrical fhock, in that part of his body which touched  
the wall. Mr. Weft farther informed me, that a perfon of un-  
doubted veracity aflured him, that, being in the door of an op-  
pofite houfe on the other fide of Water-ftreet, (which you know  
js but narrow) he faw the lightning diffufed over the pavement,  
which was then very wet with rain, to the diftance of two or  
three yards from the foot of the conductor. And that another  
perfon, of very good credit, told him, that he, being a few  
doors off, on the other fide of the ftreet, faw the lightning  
above, darting in fuch dire@ion, that it appeared to him to be  
dire&amp;tly over that pointed rod.  
  
¢ Upon receiving this information, and being defirous of far-  
ther fatisfaction, there being no traces of the lightning to be  
difcovered in the conduétor, as far as we could examine it be-  
low, I propofed to Mr. Weft, our going to the top of the houfe,  
  
to examine the pointed rod; afluring him, thatif the igntning |  
  
had pafled through it, the point muft have been melted; and,  
to our great fatisfaction, we found it fo. This iron rod extend-  
ed in height about nine feet and a half above a ftack of chim-  
nies to which it was fixed; (but I fuppofe, three or four feet  
would have been fufficient).. It was fomewhat more than half  
an inch diameter in the thickeft part, and tapering to the upper  
end. The conductor, from the lower end of it to the earth,  
confifted of fquare iron nail-rods, not much above a quarter of  
an inch thick, connected together by interlinking joints. It ex-  
tended down the cedar roof to the eaves, and from thence down  
the wall of the houfe, four ftory and a half, to the pavement in  
Water-ftreet ; being faftned to the wall, in feveral places, by  
{mall iron hooks. “The lower end was fixed to a ring in the  
top of an iron ftake, that was driven about four or five feet into  
the ground. ‘The above-mentioned iron rod had a hole in the  
top of it, about two inches deep, wherein was inferted a brafs  
wire, about two lines thick, and when firft put there, about ten  
inches long, terminating in a very acute point; but now its  
whole length was no more than feven inches and a half, and the  
top very blunt. Some of the metal appears to be miffing; the  
flendereft part of the wire being, as I fufpect, confumed into  
{moke. But fome of it, where the wire was a little thicker,  
being only melted by the lightning, funk down while in a fluid  
fiat¢, and formed a rough irregular cap, lower on one fide than  
the other, round the upper end of what remained, and became  
intimately united therewith.  
  
* This was al! the damage that Mr. Weft fuftained by a ter-  
rible ftroke of lightning : A moft convincing proof of the great  
utility of this method of preventing its dreadful effects. Surely
