Richard Grant White, says Scott, though  
the most vivid, imaginative and creative of  
novelists, is one of the most incorrect of writ-

William Cooper, an officer of a lunatic asy-  
lum in England, recently put a patient into a  
bath, and with brutal carelessness turned on  
hot water instead of cold, thus scalding the  
poor madman to death. He was arrested and  
committed for manslaughter, which intensely  
surprised him, ,
