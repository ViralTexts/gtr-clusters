T0U5G INDIAN PRINCE  
From Good Words.  
In that strange &quot;fortuitous concourse  
of atoms&quot; which streams perpetually  
from the most distant parts of the  
world into that Alexandria of the  
West London the cosmopolitan­  
there came to as last summer a young  
Indian sovereign prince, tne juanara  
jah of Kclapoor.  
It was the first time that a reigning  
Hindoo bad ever ventured to travel  
so far, and the Journey was a great  
event among his people, who were  
much distressed at the idea of his  
crossing the Bea. The whole under-  
takinir was one. indeed, reauirins  
degree of resolution which it is diffi  
cult for us to realize. He belonged.  
however, to the Mabratias, who are  
more enterprising than most races of  
tne Aunaoos. rte naa naa an isngusn  
tutor and an officer of the Indian sei  
vice residing with him snoke Eneliah  
well and had acquired a certain knowl  
edge or modern History ana or ine  
politics and statesmen of the day.  
which enabled him to be interested in  
the conversation going on around  
him.  
He was barely twenty, though he  
looked much older; a small made man  
with extremely slender bands and  
feet, bis complexion of that pleasant­  
ly brown color which looks as if it had  
been Just ripened by the sun, not  
scorched black; the eyes very large  
lustrous, without much expression;  
and a contemplative, rather child  
like look: his white teeth shone bril  
liantly, however, when he Bpoke and  
lighted up the dark face.  
A kindly, gentle young prince, not  
wanting in intelligence, with a sort of  
easy dignity, as oi one used to be obey­  
ed, but apparently quite contented to  
remain languidly In the place where  
he nannened to be. so mac one won  
dered the more to see him venturing  
so far from home.  
He was ordinarily dressed in a kind  
of dark green cloth coat, with a curi­  
ous edifice on his head, formed of rolls  
of red muslin twisted into thin coils,  
without which be was never seen in  
public, any more than Louis XIV.  
without his wig. He would have con  
sidered it an act of rudeness on his  
part to show himself bareheaded  
though he puiiea on ius turuan wnen  
with his own people only. He had  
never been seen alone in his life, and  
used to sit chatting and laughing with  
his attendants on terms of perfect  
ease, curiously mixed with the Orien  
tal depth ol respect and leverance wnn  
which they treated him.  
He was already married, and a child  
had been born to him previous to his  
departure. &quot;Only a girl,&quot; however,  
much to his disappointment, as a  
daughter could not inherit, The  
Mahrattas are monogamists; but sov­  
ereigns and very great chiefs are some­  
times, though for reasons of state poli­  
cy, allowed by the &#x27;sages&#x27; to take a  
second wile.  
He had expressed a wish to see ordi  
nary country life in England, and ac­  
cordingly went to pay a visit in a  
country home. He came attended by  
three of his thirteen native servants,  
his English footman, and the English  
officer who accompanied him every­  
where; but the accommodation requir­  
ed for the native suite was not exces­  
sive. The Rajah himself (accepted a  
bed, but slept on the outside of it,  
wrapped in a manificient pelisse of  
scarlet cloth embroidered with gold.  
The attendents lay in rugs on the floor  
in their masters room and tne dress­  
ing room adjoining. His religious  
ablutions every morning were long  
and most scrupulously performed.  
Everything about him was kept with  
great cleanliness and nicety but to  
be touched by no intrusive housemaid.  
There was at first some difficulty in  
the arrangements concerning food.  
Not only must the killing and the  
cooking be done by the hands of the  
orthodox, but the passing of the shad­  
ow of any but a &quot;twice born&quot; over  
the result, wnen prepared, wouia  
render it unfit to eat. All approach  
during these operations is warded off  
most energetically.  
A small garden house having been  
some fellow, clad in brown cloth, with  
red turban HKe his master&#x27;s tne  
&quot;cook.&quot; of rather darker shade, in  
white garments, with a red fez: and a  
third tall fellow, whom the English  
servants nicknamed &quot;the kitchen-  
maid.&quot; in blue, with a turban, en  
camped there with an immense chest  
i . i i ia 4, rwn  
wmcn tcey oruu&amp;iib wiuu uiem. Auej  
built their charcoal fire in the corner,  
and established themselves beside it,  
squatting with their multitudinous  
copper vessels, big and little, without  
handles, used alike to cook on the  
fire and to felch water, as they would  
use none which they did not them­  
selves draw at the well.  
They brought their own rice, spices.  
meat and flour with them, and ac  
cepted nothing but live fowls, eggs.  
and vegeiaotes; wey were very uoerai  
in giving away their food, to which  
the cloves, curry powder, etc., which  
they used for everything alike, gave  
a certain sameness of firery taste al  
most intolerable to western palates,  
but wbicn was otherwise very good.  
They all ate with their fingers, but  
scrupulously wasnea tneir nanus ai­  
terward. The rest of the day the at  
tendants sat munching cloves and  
nuts of various descriptions, ttmoking  
from a common pipe, which each  
passed on after taking a single whiff.  
One of them was always left on guard  
less the vessels, etc, should be touch­  
ed, and so defiled. They were ex­  
tremely intelligent, and snowed them­  
selves very quick in comprehending  
everything with little language but  
that or signs by tnose wnonaa to aeai  
with them.  
A morning room was given up to  
Rajah, with an entrance on the gar­  
den, through which his meats were  
brought without danger of contamina  
tion the cook in ms wmie garments  
his feet bare on the rough gravel, but  
his head scrupulously covered (Indi­  
an respect is snown in a way exactly  
the opposite of European manners),  
bearing it aloft on one hand, the  
arm bent back, a little tray covered  
with a napkin. The Rajah was ex­  
tremely kind and courteous, making  
very pleasantly such pretty little  
speeches as his metier ot Prince requir­  
ed. &quot;I am enamored of your garden,&quot;  
he said to the recture&#x27;s wife, as she  
showed him her parterres.. He had  
even got up the little bits of society  
&quot;slang,&quot; and declared he had &quot;enjoy­  
ed the visit immensely!&quot; He played  
eacerlv at croquet, and the wide, green  
English lawn under the shadow of  
the trees was an oasis of common in­  
terest for the dusky little Eastern  
Prince, and the fair haired, fair com­  
plexioned Western girls and children,  
very curious to watch and consider  
amongst the dearth ot points where in­  
tercourse was possible; while at a re­  
spectful distance his three attendants  
stood following the success of their  
master&#x27;s strokes with extreme interest.  
Aajaram was an heir only by adop­  
tion, as the previous sovereign of Kol­  
apoor had no son. He succeeded to  
the principality about two years ago.  
The little state contains about a mil­  
lion inhabitants, including feudateries,  
over whom the sovereign has power  
of life and death; and a tolerably large  
revenue is collected from the inhabi­  
tant, thanks to its Inexhaustibly fer­  
tile soil, where the same crops nave  
come up on the same ground for cen­  
turies, without manure and without  
signs of failure.  
About the beginning of last year the  
young Prince determined to spend the  
lime ueiore rescuing uis majority in a  
pilgrimage to Englaud, which he  
reached in June. He hired a house in  
London, and worked hard at seeing

as soon as the breath was out ,of the  
Rajah&#x27;s body, his poor attendant began  
their preparations, intending at first to  
ourn it, on tne .bung &#x27;Arno, tne . very  
midst of the city, as the ceremony  
must be performed on the banks of a  
river.&#x27; This, of coune. could not be

ou Augustus jraKBt uuuuueu . permis  
sion rrom tne Italian authorities to al  
low the funeral to be carried out after  
midnight, at the end of the Cascine,  
two miles from the town.  
It was a dark night: a Mustering  
north wind was , blowing. and the  
cold was biting, says an eye-witness;  
the pile had been built already breast  
njgn, ana near it was a fire, rouud  
which a group of Hindoos were stand  
ing sadly and silenay. &quot;The Rajah  
was the kindest and best of masters,  
and these poor&#x27; fellows are as grieved  
at his loss as if he were their own  
father,&quot; was the affectionate tribute of  
his English servant 1 . ..&#x27;,4 V -  
.Presently came up an omnibus con  
taining &#x27; the body, which was then  
brought ont upon a plank. : As it was  
borne along, the light from two feeble  
lanterns fell on the placid features of  
young anu apparently corpulent  
man: The turban and a. richly, em­  
broidered robe : which wrapped the  
corpse were of . bright scarlet; the  
bracelet, necklaces and jewels around  
his neck and arms were said to be of  
great value, and were all afterward  
consumed in the fire. The body was  
then laid reverentially upon the pile.  
One attendant placed betel-nut iu the  
mouth and hand; a second piled cam­  
phor around it another muttered sev  
eral prayers. A Brahmin priest per  
formed strange ceremonies with a  
white linen cloth, which be folded and  
unfolded., offering Tip nravers while  
kneading dough, to be placed along­  
sidetbe corpse, which was then care-.  
nujy rencea in with logs and Planks.  
forming a sort of box, into which were  
thrown perfumes ana essences: fresh  
logs were piled up for about a couple  
of yards more; camphor, and a mix  
ture oi beeswax anu turpentine, and  
a quantity of brushwood and shavings  
were added, and the mass was then  
kindled. . The flames shot up brilliant  
driven by a strong gust of wind.  
throwing a lurid glare on the numer  
ous spectators, the muddy Arno, &#x27;the  
macs tuumps oi trees, not yet quite  
bare of leaves, and the groups of Indi  
ans of every different shade of color  
from coal black to light brown, with  
weir glistening wnue teetn, and tur­  
bans differing in shape according to  
the rank of the wearers. Each had  
his settled station near the funeral fire,  
and stood gazing intently on it during  
the long, cold hours with a kind of  
mournful, forlorn resignktion which  
was extremely - loucniDg many . oi  
them weeping bitterly. At seven in  
the morning the wood was all con-.  
8umed, the embers were extinguished  
by, water rrom tne river, tne ashes  
were collected and placed in a porce­  
lain jar to be carried borne. &#x27; Every­  
thing used in the funeral pile was then  
taken out in a boat and sunk in mid­  
stream, and the attendant laid fresh  
earth on the spot itself, traced in the  
form of a heart around which were  
then placed some vessels containing  
rice. Then ail the .Hindoos knelt and  
prayed with their faces to the ground  
Uie dismal ceremony . was finished,  
and the forlorn retinue departed in  
silence, bearing with them - the vasei  
with tne ashes to be thrown into the  
Ganges when they should reach their  
native land. The next day they bad  
all left Florence. ; -  
And thus, far from his Indian, aud  
even bis English friends, his country,  
his young wife and child, amongst  
men of an alien religion, of foreign  
and unsympathizhig race, the poor  
boy Rajah passed away

A YOUNH &#x27;INDIAN&#x27; I&#x27;lUXCE  
1&#x27;rout Oood Words. &#x27;  
In tliatstrance &quot;fortuitous eoncourse  
  
of atoms&quot; which streams perpetually  
from tho most distant parts of the  
world Into that Alexandria of the  
West London tho , cosmopolitan  
there came to us last summer a young  
Indian sovereign prince, tho Mahara  
jah of Kolapoor.  
it was cue lirsi lime mat u reicnuiK  
Hindoo had ever ventured to travel  
so far, and the Journey was a great  
event among his people, who wero  
much distressed at the idea of his  
crossing the sea. The whole under­  
taking was one, indeed, requiring a  
degree of resolution which it is dilll­  
oult for us to realize. He belonged,  
however, to the Mahrutias, who are  
more enterprising than most races of  
Uie JllndOOS. XIO UUU uau nu Xing&quot;-..  
ntiiwr of the Indian sei  
vice residing with him spoke LiigUsh  
well and had acquired a certain knowl­  
edge of modem history aud of the  
politics aud statesmen of tho day,  
which enabled him to be interested in  
the conversation going on around  
him. . .  
He was barely twenty, though ho  
looked mucholder; a small mado man  
with extremely slender hands and  
feet, his complexion of thut pleasant­  
ly brown color which looks as if it hud  
iuHt rinened bv tho sun. not  
scorched black; the eyes very largo  
lustrous, without much expression;  
and a contemplative, rather child  
like look; his white teetli suono uru­  
llantly, however, when he spoke and  
lighted up the dark face.  
A kindly, gentle young prince, not  
wanting in intelligence, with a sort of  
easy dignity, as of one used to bo obey­  
ed, but apparently quite contented to  
remain languidly In the plaoo where  
ho .happened to be, so that one won­  
dered the more to see bitn venturing  
so far from home.  
He was ordinarily dressed in a mud  
of dark green cloth coat, with a curi­  
ous edifice on his head, formed of rolls  
of red muslin twisted into thin coils,  
without which re was never seen hi  
public, any more . than Louis XIV.  
without his wiir. Ho would have con  
sidered it an act of rudeness on his  
part to show himself bareheaded  
tnougu ne puiieu ou iiis iiiruan wuun  
with his own people only. He had  
nnver linen seen alone ill his life, and  
used to sit chatting and laughing witli  
his attendants ou terms of perfect  
ease, curiously mixed with the Orien­  
tal depth of respect aud levcranco with  
whlon tney treaieu mm.  
Ho was already married, aud a child  
had been born to him previous to his  
departure. &quot;Only u girl,&quot; however,

daughter could not inherit, The  
Mahrattas aro monogamists; but sov­  
ereigns and very great chiefs are some­  
times, though for reasons of state poli­  
cy, allowed by the &#x27;sages&#x27; to talse n  
second wife.  
He had expressed a wish tosr c ordi  
nary country life in England, and ac­  
cordingly went to pay a visit In a  
country home. He came attended by  
three of nis thirteen native servants,  
hisEnellsh footman, and the EiikUsIi  
olllcer who accompanied him every­  
where; but the accommodation requir­  
ed for the native suite wns not exces­  
sive. The ltajah himself accepted a  
bed, hut slept on tno oiusiuo oi ic,  
wrapped in a mauifleiout pelisse of  
scarlet cloth embroidered with gold.  
Tho atteudeuts lay in rues on the lloor  
in their master&#x27;s room and tho dress­  
Incr room adjoining. &#x27;His rellg!oti3  
ablutions every morning were long  
aud most scrupulously penormou.  
Everything about him was kept with  
great cleanliuess and nicely but to  
be touched uy no intrusive iiouseimiui.  
There was at first some difficulty in  
the arrangements concerning food.  
Not oulv must tho killing and the  
cooking bo done by the hands of the  
orthodox, but the passing 3i me simu­  
ow of any but a &quot;twice born&quot; over  
the result, when prepared, wouui  
render it unfit to eat. All approach  
during these operations is warded oil&#x27;  
most energetically.  
A small garden liouso laving been  
cleared out, Duuderbar, a tall, hand­  
some fellow, clad in brown cloth, with  
a red turban like his master&#x27;s the  
&quot;cDok.&quot; of rather darker shade, m  
white garments, with a red fez: and a  
third tall fellow, whom tho English  
servants nicknamed &quot;tho kitchen-  
maid,&quot; in blue, with a turban, en  
camped there with an immense chest  
which they brought with them. They  
built their charcoal fire in the comer,  
and established themselves beside it.  
squatting with their multitudinous  
copper vessels, Dig aim nine, without  
handles, used alike to cook on 11: e  
fire and to fetch water, as they would  
use none which they did not them  
selves draw at the well.  
Thev brought their own rice, snices.  
meat, and flour with them, and ac  
cepted nothing but live fowls, eggs,  
and vegetables; they wero very liberal  
in giving away their foot!, to which  
the cloves, curry powtier, etc., winon  
Lev used for everything alike, gave  
a certain sameness or hrery taste ut­  
most intolerable to Western palates,  
but which was otherwise very good.  
They all ate with their fingers, but  
scrupulously washed their hands af  
terward, rue rest oi tne tiny uie iu­  
tendauta sat munching cloves and  
nuts of various descriptions, smoking  
from a common pipe, which eueli  
naKsfid on after taking a single wl.iil.  
One of thein was always left ou guard  
less the vessels, etc., should be touch­

tremely Intelligent, and showed them­  
selves very quick in comprehending  
everything with little language but  
that or signs by tnoso wnonau to ului  
with tliem.  
A morning room was given up to  
Bajuh. with an entrance on the gar­  
den, through which his meats were  
brought without danger or contamina­  
tion tho cook in his white garments  
his feet bare on the rough gravel, but

A TOUStt IXDIAX TRIXCE  
1 From Good Words.  
In that strange &quot;fortuitous concourse  
of atoms&quot; which streacs perpetually  
from the most distant parts of the  
world into that Alexandria of the  
West London the cosmopolitan  
there came to us last summer a young  
Indian sovereign prince, the Mahara­  
jah of Kclapoor.  
It was the first time that a reigning  
Hindoo had ever ventured to travel  
so far, and the journey was a great  
event among bis people, who were  
much distressed at the idea of his  
crossing the sea. The whole under­  
taking was one, indeed, requiring a  
degree of resolution which it is difli­  
culffor us to realize. He belonged,  
however, to the Mahratias, who are  
more enterprising than most races of  
the Hindoos. He bad had an English  
tutor and an officer of the Indian eei­  
vice residing with him spoke English  
well and had acquired a certain knowl­  
edge of modern history and of the  
politics and statesmen of the day.  
which enabled him to be interested iu  
the conversation going on around  
him.  
He was barely twenty, though he  
looked much older; a small made man  
with extremely slender hands and  
feet, his complexion of that pleasant­  
ly brown color which looks as if it had  
been just ripened by the sun, not  
scorched black; the eyes very large  
lustrous, without much expression;  
and a contemplative, rather child­  
like look; his white teeth shone bril­  
liantly, however, when he spoke and  
lighted up the dark face.  
A kindly, gentle young prince, not  
wanting in intelligence, with a sort of  
easy dignity, as of one used to be obey­  
ed, but apparently quite contented to  
remain languidly in-the place where  
he happened to be, so that one won­  
dered the more to see him venturing  
so far from home.  
He was ordinarily dressed in a kind  
of dark green cloth coat, with a curi­  
ous edifice on his head, formed of rolls  
of red muslin twisted into thin coils,  
without which te was never seen in  
public, any more than Louis XIV.  
Without his wig. He would have con­  
sidered it an act of rudeness on his  
part to show himself bareheaded  
though he pulled off Lis turban when  
with his own people only. He had  
never been seen alone in his life, and  
used to sit chatting and laughing with  
his attendants on terms of perfect  
ease, curiously mixed with the Orien­  
tal depth of respect and leverauce with  
which they treated him.  
He was already married, and a child  
had been born to him previous to his  
departure. &quot;Only a girl,&quot; however,  
much to his disappointment, as a  
daughter could not inherit, The  
Mahrattas are monogamists; but sov  
ereigns and very great chiefs are some  
times, though lor reasons of state poli  
cy, allowed by the &#x27;sages&#x27; to take a  
second wife.  
He had expressed a wish to see ordi  
nary country life in England, and ac  
cordingly went to pay a visit in a  
country home, lie came attended by  
three of his thirteen native servants,  
his English footman, and the English  
officer who accompanied him every  
where; but the accommodation requir  
ed for the native suite was not exces  
sive. The Rajah himself accepted a  
bed, but Blept on the outside of it,  
wrapped in a maniflcient nelisse of  
scarlet cloth embroidered with gold.  
The attendents lay in rugs on the floor  
in their master&#x27;s room and the dress­  
ing room adjoining. His religious  
ablutions every morning were long  
aud most scrupulously performed.  
Everything about him was kept with  
great cleanliness and nicety but to  
be touched by no intrusive housemaid.  
There was at first some difficulty in  
the arrangements concerning food.  
Not only must the killing and the  
cooking be done by the hands of the  
orthodox, but the passing al the shad­  
ow of any but a &quot;twice born&quot; over  
the result, when prepared, would  
render it unfit to eat. All approach  
during these operations is warded off  
most energetically.  
A small garden house having been  
cleared lout, Dunderbar, a tall, hand­  
some fellow, clad in brown cloth, with  
a red turban like Lis master&#x27;s the  
&quot;caok,&quot; of rather darker shade, In  
white garments, with a red fez; and a  
third tall fellow, whom the English  
servants nicknamed &quot;the kitchen­  
maid,&quot; in blue, with a turban, en­  
camped there with an immense chest  
which they brought with them. They  
built their charcoal fire in the corner,  
and established themselves beside it,  
squatting with their multitudicous  
copper vessels, big and little, without  
handles, used alike to cook on the  
fire and to fetch water, as they would  
use none which they did not them­  
selves draw at the well.  
They brought their own rice, spices,  
meat, and flour with them, and ac­  
cented nothing but live fowls, eirgs,  
and vegetables; they were very liberal  
in giving away their food, to which  
the cloves, curry powder, etc., which  
they used for everything tlike, gave  
a certain sameness of nrery taste al­  
most intolerable to Western palates,  
but wThich was otherwise very good.  
They all ate with their fingers, but  
scrupulously washed their hands af­  
terward. The rest of the day the at­  
tendants sat munching cloves and  
nuts of various descriptions, smoking  
from a common pipe, which each  
passed on after taking a single whiff.  
One of them was always left on guard  
less the vesselSj etc., should be touch­  
ed, and so denied. They were ex­  
tremely intelligent, and showed them­  
selves very quick in comprehending  
everything with little language but  
that of sigus by those who had to deal  
with them.  
A morning room was given  
uj to  
iiajah, with an entrance on the gar  
ueu, vurougu wuicu um meats were  
brought without danger of contamiua-  
tion the cook in his white garments

showed him her parterres. He had

eagerly at croquet, and the w:de, green

The Httle state contains about a mil­  
lion inhabitants, including feudateries,  
over whom the sovereign has power  
of life and death; and a tolerably large  
revenue ia collected from the inhabi­  
tantt, thanks to its inexhaustibly fer  
tile soil, where the same crops have  
come up on the same ground for cen  
tunes, without manure and without  
signs or failure.  
About the beginning of last year the  
young Prluco determined to spend the  
time before reaching his majority in a  
pilgrimage to England, which he  
reached in June. He hired a house in  
jjonaon, and worKea card at seeing  
the sights required from a conscien­  
tious traveler; attended debates in both  
Houses of Pariiment, was present at a  
Queen&#x27;s ball in gorgeous apparel,  
where, In his cloth of gold tisues, neck­  
laces, and strings of jewels, he looked  
like the prince in a fairy tale. He  
paid a visit to the Queen at Windsor,  
who he said, &quot;was very kind;&quot; attend­  
ed a meeting of the British Association  
at Liverpool, where, being asked to  
speak, he said a few words much to  
the satisfaction of his audience on his  
! Intention to do all in his power to en­  
courage the cultivation of cotton on  
his return to India; went into Scotland  
where he distributed the prizes at a  
great volunteer festival, and made a  
second little speech, greatly to the pur­  
pose, about the good feeling growing  
up between East and West, and on  
the friendly relations of India . to En­  
gland. He ended by a vtait to the  
Maharajah Daleep Singh, in Suffolk,  
which he is said to have much enjoy­  
ed. He seemed much pleased, alto­  
gether, with his treatment during his  
whol stay, and was turning his steps  
homeward to India througn Belgium,  
the Tyrol, and Italy, the way by Paris  
where he otherwise wished to have  
gone, iieing blocked by the war, when  
e was overtaken by the winter.  
The Bnow fell, and his followers  
were extremely anxious to carry back  
a box of the strange stuff to &quot;show  
them at home.&quot; Even the moderate  
degree of cold In an English October  
had tried the men very painfully, and  
probably affected poor Rajaram him,  
self. He was taken 111 at Florence  
with heart complaint, from which he  
had already suffering before at Inn­  
spruck on his journey. Nothing,  
probably, could nave been of much  
use in such a case; he disliked being  
attended by Western physicians, and  
the end was very sudden at last,  
though the best doctors in Florence  
were summoned to his aid for the satis­  
faction of his most careful and judici­  
ous guardian, Captain West, Almost  
assoonasthe breath was out of the  
Rajah&#x27;s body, his poor attendant began  
their preparations,, intending at first to  
burn it, on the Lung &#x27;Arno, the very  
midst of the city, as the ceremony  
must be performed on the banks of a  
river. This, of course, could not be  
germitted, and with much difficulty  
ir Augustus Paget obtained permis­  
sion from the Italian authorities to al­  
low the funeral to be carried out after  
midnight, at the end of the Cascine,  
two miles from the town.  
It was a dark night; a blustering  
north wind was blowing, and the  
cold was biting, says an eye-witness;  
the pile had been built already breast  
high, and near it was a fire, rouud  
which a group of Hindoos were stand­  
ing sadly aud silently. &quot;The Rajah  
was the kindest and best of masters,  
and these poor fellows are as grieved  
at his loss as if he were their own  
father,&quot; was the affectionate tribute of  
his English servant.  
Presently came up au omnibus con­  
taining the body, which . was then  
brought out upon a plank. As it was  
borne along, the light from two feeble  
lanterns fell on the placid features of  
a young ami apparently corpulent  
man. The turban and a richly em­  
broidered robe which wrapped the  
corpse were of bright scarlet; the  
bracelet, necklaces and jewels around  
his neck and arms were said to be of  
great value, and were all afterward  
consumed in the fire. The body was  
then laid reverentially upon the pile.  
One at tendant placed betel-nut In the  
mouth and hand; a second piled cam­  
phor around it, another muttered sev  
eral prayers. A lirahmin priest per­  
formed strange ceremonies with a  
white linen cloth, which he folded and  
unfolded, offering up prayers while  
kneading dough, to be placed along­  
side the corpse, which was then care­  
fully fenced in with logs and planks,  
form ing a sort of box, into which were  
thrown perfumes and essences; fresh  
logs were piled up for about a couple  
of yards more; camphor, and a mix­  
ture of beeswax and turpentine, and  
a quantity of brushwood and shavings  
were added, and the mass was then  
kindled. The llames shot up brilliant  
driven by a strong gust of wind,  
throwing a lurid glare on the numer­  
ous spectators, the muddy Arno, the  
black clumps of trees, not yet quite  
bare of leaves, and the groups of Indi­  
ans of every different shade of color  
from ooal black to light brown, with  
their glistening white teeth, and tur­  
bans differing in shape according to  
the rank of the wearers. Each had  
his settled station near the funeral fire,  
and stood gazing intently on it during  
the long, cold hours with a kind of  
mournful, forlorn resignation which  
was extremely touching many of  
them weeping bitterly. At seven in  
the morning the wood was all con-  
! sumed, the embers were extinguished  
i by, water rrom the river, the ashes  
j were collected and placed in a orce-  
lain jar to be carried home. Every­  
( thing used in the funeral pile was then  
i taken nut in a boat and sunk iu mid  
stream, and the attendant laid iresu  
earth on the spot itself, traced in the  
form of a heart, a rouud which were  
then placed some vessels containing  
rice. Then all the Hindoos knelt and  
t prayed with their faces to the ground  
j uie nismai ceremony was niuueu,  
amj the forlorn retinue departed in  
eilene, bearing with them the vase  
wjtn the ashes to be thrown into the  
Ganges when they should reach their  
native land. The next day they had  
I an left Florence.

bout the beginning of last year the  
young Prince determined to spend the  
time before reaching his majority in a  
pilgrimage to England, which he  
reached in June. He hired a house in  
London, and worked hard at seeing  
the sights required from a conscien­  
tious traveler; attended debates in both  
Houses of Parliment, was present at a  
Queen&#x27;s ball in gorgeous apparel,  
where, in his cloth of gold tisues, neck­  
laces, and strings of jewels, he looked  
like the prince in a fairy tale. He  
paid a visit to the Queen at Windsor,  
who he said, &quot;was very kind;&quot; attend  
ed a meeting of the British Association  
at Liverpool, where, being asked to  
speak, he said a few words much to  
the satisfaction of his audience on his  
intention to do all in his power to en  
courage the cultivation of cotton on  
his return to India; went into Scotland  
where he distributed the prizes at a  
great volunteer festival, and made a  
second little speech, greatly to the pur.­  
pose, about the good feeling growing  
up between East and West, and on  
the friendly relations of India to En­  
gland. He ended by a visit to the  
Maharajah Daleep Singh, in Suflolk,  
which he is said to have much enjoy.­  
ed. He seemed much pleased, alto­  
gether, with his treatment during his  
whole stay, and was turning his steps  
homeward to India through Belgium,  
the Tyrol, and Italy, the way by Paris  
where he otherwise wished to have  
gone, being blocked by the war, when  
he was overtaken by the winter.  
The snow fell, and his followers  
were extremely anxious to carry back  
a box of the strange stuff to &quot;show  
them at home.&quot; Even the moderate  
degree of cold in an English October  
had tried the men very painfully, and  
probably affected poor Rajaram him­  
self. He was taken ill at Florence  
with heart complaint, from which he  
had already suffering before at Inn­  
spruck on his journey. Nothing,  
probably, could have been of much  
use in such a case; he disliked being  
attended by Western physicians, and  
the end was very sudden at last,  
though the best doctors in Florence  
were summoned to his aid for the satis­  
faction of his most careful and judici­  
ous guardian, Captain West. Almost  
as soon as the breath was out of the  
Rajah&#x27;s body, his poor attendant began  
their preparations, intending at first to  
burn it, on the Lung &#x27;Arno, the very  
midst of the city, as the ceremony  
must be performed on the banks of a  
river. This, of course, could not be  
permitted, and with much difficulty  
Sir Augustus Paget obtained permis-  
Sloh from the Italian authorities to al  
low the funeral to be carried out after  
midnight, at the end of the Cascine,  
two miles from the town.  
It was a dark night; a blustering  
north wind was blowing, and the  
cold was biting, says an eye-witness;  
the ple had been bullt already breast  
high, and near it was a fire, rouud  
which a group of Hindoos were stand  
ing sadly and silently. &quot;The Rajah  
was the kindest and best of masters,  
and these poor fellows are as grieved  
at his loss as if he were their own  
father,&quot; was the affectionate tribute of  
brought out upon a plank. As it was  
borne alona, the light from two feebl  
anterns fell on the placid features of  
e e o  
a young and apbarently corpulent  
man. The turban and a richly eme  
broidered robe which wrapped the  
were of bright searlet, the  
 e e o  o e o eo o  
bracelet, necklaces and jewels around  
his neck and arms were said to be of  
great value, and were all afterward  
consumed in the fire. The body was  
then laid reverentially upon the pile.  
One attendant placed betel-nut in the  
 mouth and hand; a second piled cam-  
phor around it, another muttered sey-  
eral prayers. A Brahmin priest per­  
formed strange ceremonies with a  
white linen cloth, which he folded and  
unfolded, offering up prayers while  
Kneading dough, to be placed along­  
side the corpse, which was then care­  
fully fenced in with logs and planks,  
forminga sort of box, into which were  
thrown perfumes and essences; fresh  
logs were piled up for about a couple  
of yard mor campor and a min­  
ture of beeswax and turpentine, and  
a quantity of brushwood and shavings  
were added, and the mass was then  
kindled. The flames shot up brilliant  
driven by a strong gust of wind,  
throwing a lurid glare on the numer­  
ous spectators, the muddy Arno, the  
black clumps of trees, not yet quite  
bare of leaves, and the groups of Indi  
ans of every different shade of color  
from coal black to light brown, with  
their glistening white teeth, and tur  
bans differing in shape according to  
the rank of the wearers. Each had  
his settled station near the funeral fire,  
and stood gazing intently on it during  
the long, cold hours with a kind of  
mournful, forlorn resignation which  
was extremely touching--many of  
them weeping bitterly. At seven in  
the morning the wood was all  
and the forlorn retinue departed in  
silence, bearing with them the vase  
with the ashes to be thrown into the  
Ganges when they should reach their  
native land. The next day they had
