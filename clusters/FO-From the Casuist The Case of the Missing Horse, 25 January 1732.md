To the Printer of the Gazette.  
According to the Request of your Correspondent, T.P. I send you my Thoughts on the following Case, by him proposed, viz.  
A Man bargained with another, for the Keeping of his Horse six Months, while he made a Voyage to Barbadoes. At his Return, he demands the Horse. The Man who had him to keep, assures the Owner, that his Horse stray’d away, or was stolen, within a few Days after he receiv’d him, and that he has not heard of him since. The Owner then demands the Value of his Horse in Money. Query, Whether the Man who took the Horse to keep, may not justly demand a Deduction of so much as the Keeping of the Horse would have amounted to for six Months, according to the Agreement?  
It does not appear they had any Dispute about the Value of the Horse, whence we may conclude there was no room for such Dispute, it being well known how much he cost, and that he could not honestly have been sold again for more.  
But the Value of the Horse is not express’d in the Case, nor the Sum agreed for keeping him six Months; wherefore in order to our more clear Apprehension of the Thing, let Ten Pounds represent the Horse’s Value, and Three Pounds the Sum agreed for his Keeping.  
Now the sole Foundation on which the Keeper can ground his Demand of a Deduction, for Keeping a Horse he did not keep, is this; Your Horse, he may say, which I was to restore to you at the end of 6 Months, was worth Ten Pounds; If I now give you Ten Pounds, ’tis an equivalent for your Horse, and equal to returning the Horse itself: Had I return’d your Horse, (value £10) you would have paid me £3 for his Keeping, and therefore would have receiv’d in Fact but £7 clear; you then suffer no Injury if I now pay you £7; and consequently you ought in Reason to allow me the remaining £3 according to our Agreement.  
But the Owner of the Horse may possibly insist upon being paid the whole Sum of Ten Pounds, without allowing any Deduction for his Keeping after he was lost; and that for these Reasons.  
1. Unless an express Agreement be made to the contrary, ’tis always suppos’d when Horses are put out to keep, that the Keeper runs the Risque of them, (unavoidable Accidents only excepted, wherein no Care of the Keeper can be supposed sufficient to preserve them, such as their being slain by Lightning, swept away by sudden Floods, or the like). This you yourself tacitly allow, when you offer to restore me the Value of my Horse. Were it otherwise, People, having no Security against a Keeper’s Neglect or Mismanagement, would never put Horses out to keep.  
2. Keepers, considering the Risque they run, always demand such a Price for keeping Horses, that if they were to follow that Business continually, they may have a living Profit, tho’ they now and then pay for a Horse they have lost. And if they were to be at no Risque, they could afford to keep Horses for less than they usually have: So that what a Man pays more for his Horse’s Keeping, than the Keeper could afford to take if he ran no Risque, is in the Nature of a Premium for the Insurance of his Horse. If I then pay you for the few Days you kept my Horse, you ought to restore me his full Value.  
3. You acknowledge that my Horse eat of your Hay and Oats but a few Days, ’tis unjust then to charge me for all the Hay and Oats that he only might have eat if you had kept him, in the Remainder of the 6 Months, and which you have now good in your Stable. If, as the Proverb says, ’tis unreasonable to expect a Horse should void Oats, who never eat any; ’tis certainly as unreasonable to expect Payment for those Oats.  
4. If Men in such Cases as this, are to be paid for keeping Horses when they were not kept; then they have a great Opportunity of wronging the Owners of Horses: For, by privately selling my Horse for his Value £10 soon after you had him in Possession, and returning me only £7 at the Expiration of the Time, demanding £3 as a Deduction agreed for his Keeping; you get that £3 clear into your Pocket; beside the Use of my Money 6 Months for nothing.  
5. But, you say, the Value of my Horse being £10 if you deduct £3 for his Keeping, and return me £7 ’tis all I would in fact have receiv’d, had you return’d my Horse; therefore, as I am no Loser, I ought to be satisfied. This Argument, were there any weight in it, might equally serve to justify a Man in selling, as abovesaid, as many of the Horses he takes to keep, as he conveniently can, putting clear into his own Purse, all that Charge their Owners must have been at for their Keeping, and returning the rest; for this being no Loss to the Owners, he may say, Where no Man is a Loser, Why may not I be a Gainer? I need only answer to this, That I allow the Horse cost me but £10 nor could I have sold him for more, had I been dispos’d to part with him; but this can be no Reason why you should buy him of me at that Price, whether I will sell him or not. ’Tis plain I valued him at £13 otherwise I should not have paid £10 for him, and agreed to give you £3 more for his Keeping till I had Occasion to use him. Thus, tho’ you pay me the whole £10 which he cost me (deducting only for his Keeping those few Days) I am still a Loser; I lose the Charge of those Days Keeping, I lose the £3 at which I valued him above what he cost me, and I lose the Advantage I might have made of my Money in 6 Months, either by the Interest, or by joining it to my Stock in Trade in my Voyage to Barbadoes. And all this I lose by your Negligence.  
6. And lastly, Whenever a Horse is put to keep, the Agreement naturally runs thus: The Keeper says, I will feed your Horse 6 Months on good Hay and Oats, if at the End of that Time you will pay me £3. The Owner says, If you will feed my Horse 6 Months on good Hay and Oats, I will give you £3 at the End of that Time. Now we may plainly see, the Keeper’s Performance of his Part of the Agreement must be antecedent to that of the Owner; and the Agreement being wholly conditional, the Owner’s Part is not in Force till the Keeper has performed his. You then, not having fed my Horse 6 Months, as you agreed to do, there lies no Obligation on me to pay you for 6 Months Feeding.  
Thus we have heard what can be said on both sides. Upon the whole, I am of Opinion, that no Deduction should be allow’d for the Keeping of the Horse after the Time of his straying. I am Yours, &amp;c.

To the Printer of the Gazette.  
  
According to the request of your correspondent &#x27;T.  
P., I send you my thoughts on the following case by him  
proposed, viz :  
  
A man bargains for the keeping of his horse six  
months, whilst he is making a voyage to Barbadoes.  
The horse strays or is stolen soon after the keeper has  
him in possession. When the owner demands the value  
of his horse in money, may not the other as justly de-  
mand so much deducted as the keeping of the horse six  
months amounts to?  
  
It does not appear that they had any dispute about  
the value of the horse, whence we may conclude there  
was no reason for such dispute, but it was well known  
how much he cost, and that he could not honestly have  
been sold again for more. But the value of the horse is  
not expressed in the case, nor the sum agreed for keep-  
ing him six months; wherefore in order to our more  
clear apprehension of the thing, let ten pounds represent  
the horse’s value and three pounds the sum agreed for  
his keeping.  
  
Now the sole foundation on which the keeper can  
found his demand of a deduction for keeping a horse he  
did not keep, is this. Your horse, he may say, which I  
was to restore to you at the end of six months was worth ten  
pounds; if I now give you ten pounds it is an equivalent for  
your horse, and equal to returning the horse itself. Had I  
returned your horse (value 101.) you would have paid me  
three pounds for his keeping, and therefore would have  
received in fact but seven pounds clear. You then suffer  
no injury if I now pay you seven pounds, and consequently  
you ought in reason to allow me the remaining three pounds  
according to our agreement.  
  
But the owner of the horse may possibly insist upon  
being paid the whole sum of ten pounds, without allow-  
ing any deduction for his keeping after he was lost, and  
that for these reasons.  
  
1. It is always supposed, unless an express agree-  
ment be made to the coutrary, when horses are put out  
to keep, that the keeper is at the risque of them (una-  
voidable accidents only excepted, wherein no care of the  
keeper can be supposed sufficient to preserve them, such  
as their being slain by lightning or the like.) This you  
yourself tacitly allow when you offer to restore me the value  
of my horse. Were it otherwise, people having no secu-  
rity against a keeper’s neglect or mismanagement would  
never put horses out to keep.  
  
2. Keepers considering the risque they run, always  
demand such a price for keeping horses, that if they  
were to follow the business twenty years, they may  
have a living profit, though they now and then pay for  
a horse they have lost ; and if they were to be at no  
risque they might affurd to keep horses for less than  
they usually have. So that what a man pays for his  
horse’s keeping, more than the keeper could afford to  
take if he ran no risque, is in the nature of a premium  
for the insurance of his horse. If I then pay you for the  
Sew days you kept my horse, you should restore me his full  
value.  
  
3. You acknowledge that my horse eat of your hay  
and oats but a few days. It is unjust then to charge  
me for ali the hay and oats that he only might have eat  
in the remainder of the six months, and which you have  
now still good in your stable. If, as the proverb says,  
it is unreasonable to expect a horse should void oats who  
never eat any, it is certainly as unreasonable to expect  
payment for those oats.  
  
4, If men in such cases as this are to be paid for keep-  
ing horses when they were not kept, then they have a  
great opportunity of wronging the owners of horses.  
For by privately selling my horse for his value (ten  
pounds) soon after you had him in possession, and re-  
turning me at the expiration of the time only seven  
pounds, demanding three pounds as a deduction agreed  
for his keeping, you get that 31. clear into your pocket,  
besides the use of my money six months for nothing.  
  
5. But you say, the value of my horse being ten  
pounds, if you deduct three for his keeping and return  
me seven, it is all I would in fact have received had  
you returned my horse; therefore as I am no loser I  
ought to be satisfied: this argument, were there any  
weight in it, might serve to justify a man in selling as  
above, as many of the horses he takes to keep as he  
conveniently can, putting clear int» his own pocket  
that charge their owner must have been at for their  
keeping, for this being no loss to the owners, he may  
say, where no man is a loser why should not I be a gainer.  
I need only answer to this, that I allow the horse cost  
me but ten pounds, nor could [ have sold him for more,  
had I been disposed to part with him, but this can be  
no reason why you should buy him of me at that price,  
whether I will sell him or not. For it is plain I valued  
hum at thirteen pounds, otherwise I should not have  
paid ten pounds for him and agreed to give you three  
pounds more for his keeping, till 1 had occasion to use  
him. Thus, though you pay me the whole ten pounds  
which he cost me, (deducting only for his keeping those  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
few days) I am still a loser; I lose the charge of those

days’ keeping; I lose the three pounds at which I  
valued him above what he cost me, and I lose the ad-  
vantage I might have made of my money in six months,  
cither by the interest or by joining it to my stock in  
trade in my voyage to Barbadoes.  
  
6. Lastly, whenever a horse is put to keep, the agree-  
ment naturally runs thus: The keeper says I will feed  
your horse six months on good hay and oats, if at the  
end of that time you will pay me three pounds. The  
owner says, if you will feed my horse six months on  
good hay and oats, I will pay you three pounds at the  
end of that time. Now we may plainly see, the keep-  
er’s performance of his part of the agreement must be  
antecedent to that of the owner; and the agreement  
being wholly conditional, the owner’s part is not in  
force till the keeper has performed his. You then not  
having fed my horse six months, as you agreed to do, there  
lies no obligation on me to pay for so much feeding.  
  
Thus we have heard what can be said on both sides.  
Upon the whole, I am of opinion that no deduction  
should be allowed for the keeping of the horse after the  
time of his straying. I am yours, &amp;c.
