Dear Sir,  
Passy, Nov. 9. 1779.  
I have received several kind Letters from you which I have not regularly answered. They gave me however great Pleasure, as they acquainted me with your Welfare, and that of your Family &amp; other Friends: and I hope you will continue writing to me as often as you can do it conveniently.  
I thank you much for the great Care &amp; Pains you have taken in regulating &amp; correcting the Edition of those Papers. Your Friendship for me appears in almost every Page; and if the Preservation of any of them should prove of Use to the Publick, it is to you that the Publick will owe the Obligation. In looking them over, I have noted some Faults of Impression, that hurt the Sense, and some other little Matters, which you will find all in a Sheet under the Title of Errata. You can best judge whether it may be worth while to add any of them to the Errata already printed, or whether it may not be as well to reserve the whole for Correction in another Edition, if such should ever be. Inclos’d I send a more perfect Copy of the Chapter.  
If I should ever recover the Pieces that were in the Hands of my Son, and those I left among my Papers, in America, I think there may be enough to make three more such Volumes; of which a great part would be more interesting.  
As to the Time of publishing, of wh

was at that time another of my Acquaintance in London. I was not 19 Years of Age when it was written. In 1730 I wrote a Piece on the other side of the Question, which began with laying for its Foundation this Fact, That almost all Men in all Ages and Countrys, do have at times made use of Prayer. Thence I reasoned, that if all things are ordain’d, Prayer must among the rest be ordain’d. But as Prayer can procure no Change in Things that are ordain’d, Praying must then be useless and an Absurdity. God would therefore not ordain Praying if every thing else was ordain’d. But Praying exists; therefore all other Things are not ordain’d, &amp;c.
