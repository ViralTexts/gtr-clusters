Philada. Jany. 23. 1763  
I received with great Pleasure my Dear Friend’s Favour of December 20. as it inform’d me that you and yours are all well.  
Mrs. Franklin admits of your Apology for dropping the Correspondence with her, and allows your Reasons to be good; but hopes when you have more Leisure it may be renew’d. She joins with me in congratulating you on your present happy Situation. She bids me say, she supposes you proceeded regularly in your Arithmetic, and that, before you got into Multiplication, you learnt Addition, in which you must often have had Occasion to say, One that I CARRY, and two, makes Three. And now I have writ this, she bids me scratch it out again. [But] I am 10th to deface my Letter, so e’en let it [stand].  
I thank you for your kind Invitation. I purpose a Journey into New England in the Spring or Summer coming. I shall not fail to pay my Respects to you and Mr. Greene when I come your Way. Please to make my Compliments acceptable to him.  
I have had a most agreable time of it in Europe; have in company with my Son, been in most Parts of England, Scotland, Flanders and Holland; and generally have enjoy’d a good Share of Health. If you had ask’d the rest of your Questions, I could more easily have made this Letter longer. Let me have them in your next. I think I am not much alter’d; at least my Esteem and Regard for my Katy (if I may still be permitted to call her so) is the same, and I believe will be unalterable whilst I am &amp;c.

Philadelphia, July 23, 1763.  
  
I received with great pleasure my dear friend’s  
letter of December 20, which informed me that  
you and yours are all well. Mrs. Franklin admits  
  
our apology for dropping the correspondence with  
  
er, and allows your reasons to be good, but hopes  
when you have more leisure it may be resumed.  
She joins me in congratulating you on a present  
happy situation. She bids me say she sup  
you proceed regularly in your arithmetic, and that  
before you got into multiplication you learnt addi-  
tion, in which you must often have had occasion to  
say, that I carry one and two make three ; and now]  
have writ this she bids me scratch it out again, but  
I am loth to deface my letter, so I let it go. * * *

of England, Scotland, Flanders and Holland, and  
generally have enjoyed a good share of health.  
If you had asked the rest of your questions, I  
could more easily have made this letter longer.  
Let me have them in your next. I think I am not  
much altered ; at least my esteem and my regard for  
my Katy (if I still may be permitted to call her so)  
are the same, and I believe will be unalterable
