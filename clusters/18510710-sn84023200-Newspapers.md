NEWSPAPERS. Judge Longstreet says: &quot;Small is the sum that is required to patronize a newspaper, and most amply remunerated is the patron. I care not how humble and unpretending the gazette which he takes, it is next to impossible to fill a sheet fifty-two times a year without putting into it something that is worth the subscription price. Every parent whose son is off to school should be supplied with a newspaper, and most amply remunerated is the patron. I well remember what a difference there was between those of my schoolmates who had, and those who had not, access to newspapers. Other things being equal, the first were always decidedly superior to the last, in debate and composition at least. The reason is plain—they had command of more facts. A newspaper is a history of current events, as well as a curious and interesting miscellany, and which youth will peruse with delight when they will read nothing else.&quot;

Judge Longstreet, of Georgia, sets forth  
the value of a newspaper:  
&quot;Small is the sum that is required to pat­  
ronize a newspaper, and most amply re­  
munerated is the patron. I care not how  
humble and unpretending the gazette he
