NEWSPAPERS. Judge Longstreet says: &quot;Small is the sum that is required to patronize a newspaper, and most amply remunerated is the patron. I care not how humble and unpretending the gazette which he takes, it is next to impossible to fill a sheet fifty-two times a year without putting into it something that is worth the subscription price. Every parent whose son is off to school should be supplied with a newspaper, and most amply remunerated is the patron. I well remember what a difference there was between those of my schoolmates who had, and those who had not, access to newspapers. Other things being equal, the first were always decidedly superior to the last, in debate and composition at least. The reason is plain—they had command of more facts. A newspaper is a history of current events, as well as a curious and interesting miscellany, and which youth will peruse with delight when they will read nothing else.&quot;

nd for the information of all I will i  
| give a certain remedy. &quot;When any one runs  
a nail or any other sharp instrument into aDy  
part of the body, take a common smoke pipe,  
fill it well, then take a cloth or silk handkerchief,  
place it over the bowl of the pipe,  
and blow the smoke through the stem into  
the wound; two or three pipe fulls will be  
sufficient to set the wound discharging. I  
have tried it myself, and five others, and  
found it gave immediate relief. If the  
wound has been some days standing, it will  
open again if the tobacco is good. Try it  
any one who may chanee to get such a  
wound.
