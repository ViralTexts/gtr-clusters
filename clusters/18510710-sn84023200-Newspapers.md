NEWSPAPERS. Judge Longstreet says: &quot;Small is the sum that is required to patronize a newspaper, and most amply remunerated is the patron. I care not how humble and unpretending the gazette which he takes, it is next to impossible to fill a sheet fifty-two times a year without putting into it something that is worth the subscription price. Every parent whose son is off to school should be supplied with a newspaper, and most amply remunerated is the patron. I well remember what a difference there was between those of my schoolmates who had, and those who had not, access to newspapers. Other things being equal, the first were always decidedly superior to the last, in debate and composition at least. The reason is plain—they had command of more facts. A newspaper is a history of current events, as well as a curious and interesting miscellany, and which youth will peruse with delight when they will read nothing else.&quot;

the water has not run for 20 years.  
Thomas James Esq., of ibis city says that  
pork is his! In I&#x27;iOi but , forty seven  
years ogo! he informs us he chartered tho  
brig Dominique, built and owned by Dud­  
ley Woodbridge and the celebrated Blaner­  
hassett, at Marietta, and intended to load  
said vessel at the mouth of the Scioto.  
In taking down &quot;the pork, from Chilli­  
cothe to tho vessel, one of the boats stove  
just above old Alexandria, in Scioio, and  
35 barrels were lost. 1 lie water was  
very high, olid Mr. Jjiries claims that the  
barrel found is one which floated to the  
spot in which it was found the other day.  
By the way. he adds; that John Mcuiy,  
Esq., (another pioneer merchant of Chilli-  
coihe,) was a partner in the pork opera­  
tion; and the advemuie was of the first  
pork ever taken out ol our river except  
200 barrels which Mr. James carried south  
the year before, viz: in 1803. At the  
time the barrol was lost, Mr. James was  
enroute to tho West InJies, where he sold  
his charge and then sailed the brig to Phi­  
ladelphia, with sugar for James &amp;Wood-bridge.-

how humble and uupretending the gazette

there was between those of my school mates  
who had and those who had not access to  
newspapers. Other things being equal, the  
first were decidedly superior to the last in

Gena Cass, in the Washington Republic,  
The statement that the Democratic pap  
er at Detroit, dissaproving the Lecompton  
Constitution, is &quot;the organ of ten. Ca  
is erroneous. Gren. Cass knows &quot;the true  
Prince&quot; by instinct, and has not differed  
seriously for more than half a century  
with the incumbent of the Presidential  
office. He is too much of a patriot for  
that. Furthermore there never has been  
and never will be, a newspaper which  
could be the organ of Genea Cass. That  
is beyond the power of the press, great as  
it is. Nobody but Genea Cass can truly  
represent Gen. Cass. Mr. Buchanan is  
for the Kansas Constitution: ditto, Gena  
Cass.  
ThE VALUE OF NEWSPAPERS. Judge  
Longstreet, of Georgia, thus sets forth the  
value of a newspaper:  
Small is the sum that is required to pa  
tronize a newspaper, and most amply re  
munerated is the patron. I care not how  
humble and unpretending the gazette he  
takes, it is next to impossible to fill a pa­  
per fifty-two times a year without some  
thing in it that is worth the subscription  
price.  
Every parent whose son is off from home  
should supply him with a paper. I well  
remember what a difference there was be  
tween those of my schoolmates who had  
and who had not, access to newspapers.  
Other things being equal, the first were  
decidedly superior to the last in composi

The reason is plain--they had command
