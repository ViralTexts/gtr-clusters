For which Purpose I shall probably set off the day after tomorrow.” Two days hence was August 17, but it would be another week before Franklin finished writing all the letters he wanted Temple to deliver. As for the trip’s duration, the intended stay of “a few Weeks” turned into a few months, much to Franklin’s distress.  
  
Dear Son,  
Passy, Augt. 16. 1784  
  
I received your Letter of the 22d past, and am glad to find that you desire to revive the affectionate Intercourse that formerly existed between us. It will be very agreable to me. Indeed nothing has ever hurt me so much and affected me with such keen Sensations, as to find my self deserted in my old Age by my only Son; and not only deserted, but to find him taking up Arms against me, in a Cause wherein my good Fame, Fortune and Life were all at Stake. You conceived, you say, that your Duty to your King &amp; Regard for your Country requir’d this. I ought not to blame you for differing in Sentiments with me in Public Affairs. We are Men, all subject to Errors. Our Opinions are not in our own Power; they are form’d and govern’d much by Circumstances that are often as inexplicable as they are irresistible.— Your Situation was such that few would have censured your remaining Neuter, tho’ there are Natural Duties which precede political Ones, and cannot be extinguish’d by them. This is a disagreable Subject. I drop it. And we will endeavour as you propose mutually to forget what has happened relating to it, as well as we can.—  
I send your Son over to pay his Duty to you. You will find him much improv’d. He is greatly esteem’d and belov’d in this Country, and will make his Way any where. It is my Desire that he should Study the Law, as a necessary Part of Knowledge for a public Man, and profitable if he should have occasion to practise it. I would have you therefore put into his Hands those Law-books you have viz. Blackstone, Coke, Bacon, Viner, &amp;c. &amp;c. He will inform you, that he received the Letter sent him by Mr Galloway, and the Paper it enclos’d, safe. On my leaving America I deposited with that Friend for you a Chest of Papers, among which was a Manuscript of 9 or 10 Volumes relating to Manufactures, Agriculture, Commerce, Finance, &amp;c. which  
  
cost me in England about 70 Guineas; and Eight Quire Books containing the Rough Drafts of all my Letters while I liv’d in London. These are missing. I hope you have got them. If not, they are lost.— Mr Vaughan has publish’d in London a Volume of what he calls my Political Works. He proposes a second Edition. But as the first was very incompleat, and you had many Things that are omitted, for I used to send you sometimes the Rough Drafts, &amp; sometimes the printed Pieces I wrote in London, I have directed him to apply to you for what may be in your Power to furnish him with, or to delay his Publication till I can be at home again—if that may ever happen. I did intend returning this Year; but the Congress, instead of giving me Leave to do so, have sent me another Commission, which will keep me here at least a Year longer; and perhaps I may then be too old and feeble to bear the Voyage. am here among a People that love and respect me, a most amiable Nation to live with, and perhaps I may conclude to die among them; for my Friends in America are dying off one after another, and I have been so long abroad that I should now be almost a Stranger in my own Country. I shall be glad to see you when convenient, but would not have you come here at present. You may confide to your Son the Family Affairs you wished to confer upon with me, for he is discreet. And I trust that you will prudently avoid introducing him to Company that it may be improper for him to be seen with. I shall hear from you by him, and any Letters to me afterwards, will come safe, under Cover directed to Mr Ferdinand Grand, Banker at Paris.  
  
Wishing you Health, and more Happiness than it seems you have lately experienced, I remain, Your affectionate Father  
  
B. Franklin

“Dear Son, Passy, Aug. 16, 1784,  
  
I received your letter of the 22d inst.  
and am glad to find that you desire to  
revive the affectionate intercourse that  
formerly existed between us. It will be  
very agreeable to me: indeed nothing  
has ever hurt me so much, and affected  
me with such keen sensations, as to find  
myself deserted in my old age by my  
only son ; and not only deserted, but to  
find him taking up arms against me ina  
cause, wherein my good fame, fortune,  
and life, were all at stake. You con-  
ceived, you say, that your duty to your  
King and regard for your Country re-  
quired this. I ought not to blame you  
for differing in sentiment with me in  
public affairs. We are men, all subject  
to errors, Our opinions are not in our  
own power; they are formed and go-  
verned much by circumstances that are  
often as inexplicable as they are irre-  
sistible. Your situation was such, that  
few would have censured your remain-  
ing neuter, though there are natural  
duties which precede political ones, and  
cannot be extinguished by them. This is .  
a disagreeable subject: I drop it. And  
we will endeavour, as you propose, mu-  
tually to forget what has happened  
relating to it, as well as wecan. I send  
your son over to pay his duty to you.  
You will find him much improved. He  
is greatly esteemed and beloved in this  
Country, and will make his way any  
where. It is my desire that he should  
study the Law, as a necessary part of  
knowledge for a public man, and profit-  
able if he should have occasion to prac-  
tise it. I would have you, therefore,  
put into his hands those Law-books you  
have, viz, Blackstone, Coke, Bacon,  
Viner, &amp;c. &amp;c. He will inform you,

deposited with that friend for you a  
chest of papers, among which was a  
manascript of nine or ten volumes, re-  
lating to manufactures, commerce, fi-  
nance, &amp;c. which cost me in England  
about seventy guineas ; and eight quire  
books, containing the rough draughts  
of all my letters while 1 lived in London.  
These are missing; I hope you have  
got them: if not, they are lost. Mr.  
Vaughan has published, in London, a  
volume of what Ae calls my Political  
Works: he proposes a second edition ;  
but, as the first was very incomplete,  
and you had many things that were  
omitted (for I used to send you some-  
times the rough drafts, and sometimes  
the printed pieces, 1 wrote in London),  
I have directed him to apply to you for  
what may be in your power to furnish  
him with, or to delay his publication till  
I can be at again — if that may  
ever happen. I did intend returning  
this year; but the Congress, instead of  
giving me leave to do so, have sent me  
another Commission, which will keep  
me here at least a year longer; and  
perhaps I may then be too old and feeble  
to bear the veyage. I am here among  
a people that love and respect me, a  
most amiable Nation to live with; and  
  
I may conclude to die among  
ae my friends in America are  
dying off one after another; and I have  
been so long abroad, that | should now  
be almost a stranger in my own country.  
I shall be glad to see you when conve-  
nient, but would not have you come  
here at present. You may confide to  
your son the family affairs you wished to  
confer upon with me, for he is discreet :  
and I trust that you will prudently  
avoid introducing him to company that  
it may be improper for him to be seen  
with. I shall hear from you by bim;  
and letters to me afterwards will come  
safe under cover directed to Mr. Ferdi-  
nand Grand, banker, at Paris. —Wishing  
you health, and more happiness than it  
seems you have lately experienced, I  
remain your affectionate father,  
  
B. FRANKLIN.”
