Passy, June 24. 1778  
On reading again the Prospectus and Explanation of your Intended Print, I find the whole Merit of giving Freedom to America, continues to be ascrib’d to me, which, as I told you in our first Conversation, I could by no means approve of, as it would be unjust to the Numbers of wise and brave Men who by their Arms and Counsels have shared in the Enterprize and contributed to its Success, (as far as it has yet succeeded) at the Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes. My Proposition to you was, and continues to be, that instead of naming me in particular, in the Explanation of the Print, it should be said, The Congress, represented by a Senator in Roman Dress, &amp;c. As it stands, I cannot consent to accept the Honour you propose to do me by dedicating the Print to me, which I understand is in this Country considered, as an Approbation. And in my own Country, it would hurt my Character and Usefulness if I were to give the least Countenance to such a Pretention, by recommending or promoting the Sale of a Print so explain’d. Upon these Considerations I must request that if you are determin’d to proceed in the Engraving, you would in a new Prospectus change the Explanation, as above propos’d; and dedicate the Print not to me but to the Congress.

“ Passy, 24 June, 1778.  
  
“Sir: On reading again the prospectus and  
explanation of your intended print, I find the  
whole merit of giving freedom to America  
continues to be ascribed to me, which, as I  
told you in our first conversation, I could by  
no means approve of, as it would be unjust to  
the number of wise and brave men who, by  
their arms and counsels, have shared in the  
enterprise and contributed to its success (as  
far as it has yet succeeded) at the hazard of  
their lives and fortunes.  
  
“ My proposition to you was, and continues  
to be, that, instead of naming me in particular  
in the explanation of the print. it should be  
said, “ The Congress, represented by a Senator  
in Roman dress, &amp;c.” As it stands, I cannot  
consent to accept the honor you propose to  
do me by dedicating the print to me, which,  
I understand, is in this country considered as  
an approbation; and in my own country it  
would hurt my character and usefulness, if I  
were to give the least countenance to such a  
pretension, by recommending or proposing the  
sale of a print so explained. Upon these  
considerations, I must request that, if you are  
determined to proceed in the engraving, you  
would, in a new prospectus, change the ex-  
planation as above proposed, and dedicate the  
print not to me, but to the Congress.”
