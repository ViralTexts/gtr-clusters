I was sometimes vex’d with an Itching on the Back, which I observ’d particularly after eating freely of Beef. And sometimes after long Confinement at Writing with little Exercise, I have felt sudden pungent Pains in the Flesh of different Parts of the Body, which I was told were scorbutic. A journey used to free me of them.  
In 1773, being in Ireland, I was, after a plentiful Dinner of Fish the first Day of my Arrival, seiz’d with a violent Vomiting and Looseness. The latter continued, tho’ more moderate as long as I staid in that Kingdom, which was 4 or 5 Weeks.  
On my Return I first observ’d a kind of Scab or Scurff on my Head, about the Bigness of a Shilling. Finding it did not heal, but rather increas’d I mention’d it to my Friend Sir J.P. who advis’d a mercurial Water to wash it, and some Physic. It slowly left that Place but appear’d in other Parts of my Head. He also advis’d my abstaining from salted Meats and Cheese, which Advice I did not much follow, often forgetting it.  
In 1775 I went to America. On the Passage I necessarily ate more Salt Meat than usual with me at London. I immediately enter’d the Congress, where and with the Committee of Safety, I sat great Part of that Year and the next 10 or 12 Hours a day without Excerscise. We lost 3 Members in those Years by Apoplexies, viz. Mr. Randolf, M. Bory, and Mr. Lynch. I had frequent Giddinesses. I went to Canada. On the Passage I suffer’d much from a number of large Boiles. In Cana

6 I lived chiefly on Salt Beef, the Fowls being too hard for my Teeth. But being poorly nourish’d, I was very weak at my Arrival; Boils continu’d to vex me, and the Scurff extending over all the small of my Back, on my Sides, my Legs, and my Arms, besides what continued under my Hair, I apply’d to a Physician, who order’d me Bellosto’s Pills and an Infusion of a Root call’d [blank in MS.] I took the Infusion a while, but it being disagreable, and finding no Effect I omitted it. I continu’d longer to take the Pills; but finding my Teeth loosning and that I had lost 3, I desisted the Use of them. I found that Bathing stop’d the Progress of the Disorder. I therefore took the Hot Bath twice a Week two Hours at a time till this last Summer. It always made me feel comfortable, as I rubb’d off the softned Scurff in the warm Water; and I otherwise enjoy’d exceeding good Health. I stated my case to Dr. Ingenhausz, and desired him to show it to Sir J.P. and obtain his Advice. They sent me from London some Medicines; but Dr. Ingenhausz proposing to come over soon, and the Affair not pressing, I resolved to omit taking the Medicines till his Arrival.  
In July the Disorder began to diminish, at first slowly, but afterwards rapidly; and by the Beginning of October, it had quitted entirely my Legs Feet Thighs, and Arms, and my Belly, a very little was left on my Sides, more on the small of my Back, but the whole daily diminishing.

During a trip in Ireland  
in 1773, Franklin, “after a  
plentiful dinner of fish the  
first day of my arrival,”  
was taken sick, and though  
not invalided, he did not  
altogether recover for four  
or five weeks. “On my re-
