After the Recess of Parliament the great Off[icers] of State generally go into the Country, and no publick Business except what may be immediately necessary, is done or taken into Consideration till the next Session brings them together again. Being much Confind to the town by business in the Winter I Usually take the Opportunity of the recess to make a Journey of two or three Months with [visits and?] Daily Exercise in the open air to recover and Establish my health. I was accordingly absent when your Respected Letter of June 22d. arrived here. I return’d just before the meeting of Parliament and take this first Convenient Opportunity of Acknowledging and Answering it.  
I was much concern’d at the Disallowance of your paper Money Act, thinking the reasons against it not well founded and that it was impossible to conceive [of them;?] indeed I told their Lordships at the board of trade that the Parliament could never mean by their Restraining Act to Exempt the Treasurer of any Province or the trustees of the Loan office from being Oblig’d to receive and take [up their notes?] or Bills they had [emitted?].  
Their answer was, that the words of the act were ag[ainst] the Bills being made a legal tender in any Case [what]ever and the business of the board was to follow the Letter of the act. They were not to Judge of the Meaning or Intention of Parliament. And I am now of Opinion that if a new act be framed and Passed without the 49th Clause which obliges the trustees to receive the bills in Discharge of the Mortgages, your Agent here may be able, Especially if it provides for the troops to get [it] confirm’d tho there is in truth a rooted prejudice in the Board against paper money. If I Should be here at the time when such an act is Presented for All[owance,] you may Depend on my Using my best Endeavours for the Service of the Province in that as well [as in] Every other wherein its Interest is Concerned.  
I am Extreamly griev’d that any Misunderstanding Should arise between the Assembly and the Governor, but I hope the same is by this time Adjusted and the Harmony between you Restor’d. With great Esteem and respect for your Character I have the Honour to be, Sir Your most Obedient and Most Humble Servant

London, Feb. 6, 1772.  
After the Recess of Parliament the  
great Officers of State generally go into  
the Country, and no publick Business,ex­  
cept what may be immediately necessary,  
is done or taken into Consideration till  
the next Session brings them together  
again. Being much Confined to the  
town by business in the Winter, I usu­  
ally take the Opportunity of the recess  
to make a Journey of two or three Mnoths  
vith Daily Exercise in the open air to  
recover and establish my health. I wa  
accor dingly absent when your Respected  
Letter of June 22d arrived here. I re  
turned Just before the meeting of Par­  
liament &amp; take this first Convenient  
Opportunity of acknowledging a an­  
swering it.  
I was much concern&#x27;d at the Disal­  
lowance of your Paper Money Act,  
thinking the reason against it not well  
founded a that it was impossrble to con­  
ceive (indeed I told their Lord ships at  
the board of trade) that the Parliamenl  
could never mean by their Restrainin  
Act to Exempt the Treasurer of an  
Province of the Trustees of the Loan  
Office from be Oblig&#x27;d to receive &amp; take  
up the notes or Bills they had Issued.  
Their answ er was, that the words of the  
act were against the Bills being made a  
legal tender in any case whatever and  
the business of the board was to follow  
the letter of the act, they were not to  
Judge of the Meaning or Intention of  
Parliament. And I am now of the Opin-  
on that if a new act be framed and Pass.  
edithout the 49th Clause which O­  
bliges he trustees to receive the Bills in  
Discharge of the Mortgages, your Agent  
here may be a ble, especially if it pro  
vides for the trouns, to get it fore&#x27;  
through, the there is in truth a rooted  
prejudice in the Boar against paper  
money. IfI should be her&#x27;e at the time  
when such an act is Presented for  
you may Depend on my using my best  
endeavours for the Service of the Proy-  
ince in that as well as in Every othe.&quot;  
where in its Interest is concerned.  
i at atroanly arteved that any mis-  
I i cateumy Siet    
assembly a the Governor but I  
Assembly a the Governor, but I hope  
 the same is by this time A djusted and the  
Harmony between you Restored.  
With great Esteem &amp; Respect for  
your character I have the Honour to be,  
Sir  
Your most Obedient and  
Most Humble Servant
