ssy, May 27. 1778  
I received yours of the 18th. inclosing one for the Countess of Selkirk which I forward this Day via Holland as you desire. It is a gallant Letter, and must give her Ladyship a high and just Opinion of your Generosity and Nobleness of Mind.  
The Dirty Insinuation you mention is of a Piece with many others from the same Quarter; the natural Produce of base Minds, who feeling no other Motive in their own Breasts, but sordid self-Interest, imagine no other Motive can exist in others, and therefore it is to that alone they ascribe the most praiseworthy Actions.

return from this expedition, Jones wrote his well-known letter  
to Lady Selkirk, and, as Dr. Franklin said of it, that it was  
“a gallant letter, which must give her ladyship a high and just  
opinion of Captain Jones’s generosity and nobleness of mind, it  
no doubt deserved praise.” To us, however, it appears con-  
ceived in a wretched taste, and utterly unworthy of a person of  
true bravery. In ape to Lady Selkirk that his object in  
besetting her house in order to kidnap her husband that he  
might be made instrumental to a general discharge of prisoners,  
and that her plate was taken merely to satisfy his sailors, wh
