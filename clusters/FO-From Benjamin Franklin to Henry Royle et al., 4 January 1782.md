hand of Mr Wild.  
There is no doubt but that a Body of sober, industrious &amp; ingenious Artisans, Men of honest and religious Principles, such as you and your Friends are describ’d to be, would be a valuable Acquisition to any Country; and I am certain you would meet with a kind &amp; friendly Reception in Pensylvania, &amp; be put into Possession of all the Rights and Privileges of free Citizens: But neither that Government nor any other in America that I know of has ever been at any public Expence to augment the Number of its Inhabitants. All who are establish’d there have come at their own Charge. The Country affords to Strangers, a good Climate, fine wholesome Air, Plenty of Provisions, good Laws, just and cheap Government, with all the Liberties civil &amp; religious that reasonable Men can wish for. These Inducements are so great, &amp; the Number of People in all the Nations of Europe who wish to partake of them is so considerable, that if the States were to undertake transporting People at the Expence of the Public, no Revenues that they have would be sufficient.

asked for information:  
  
“There is no doubt but that a body of sober,  
industrious, and ingenious artists, mer of hon-  
est and religious principles, such as you and  
your friends are described to be, would be a  
Valuable acquisition to any country; and I am  
certain you woula meet with a kind and friendly  
reception in Pennsylvania, and be put into pos-  
session of all the rights and privileges of free  
citizens; but peither that Government nor any  
other in America that I know of has ever been  
at public expense to augment the number of its  
inhabitants. All who are established there have  
eome at their own charge. The country affords  
to strangers a good climate, fine, wholesome air,  
  
lenty of provisions, good laws, just and cheap  
Gorecnmeat, with all the liberties, civil and  
religious, that reasonable men Can wish for.  
These inducements are so great and the number  
of people in all nations of Europe who wish te  
take of them is so considerable that if the  
Brates were to undertake transporting people at  
the expense of the people, no revenues that they  
have would be sufiicient.” 3
