Singer.  
  
Fair Venus calls, her Voice obey;  
In Beauty’s Arms spend Night &amp; Day.  
The Joys of Love all Joys excell,  
And Loving is certainly Living well.  
  
Chorus.  
  
O No!  
Not so!  
For honest Souls know,  
Friends and a Bottle still bear the Bell.  
  
Singer.  
  
Then let us get Money, like Bees lay up Honey,  
We’ll build us new Hives, &amp; store them well;  
The Sight of our Treasure shall yield us great Pleasure,  
We’ll count it, &amp; chink it, &amp; jingle it well:  
  
Chorus.  
  
O No!  
Not so!  
For honest Souls know,  
Friends and a Bottle still bear the Bell.  
  
Singer.  
  
If this does not fit ye, lets govern the City;  
In Power is Pleasure, no Tongue can tell.  
By Crouds tho’ you’re teased, your Pride shall be pleased,  
And this can make Lucifer happy in Hell.  
  
Chorus  
  
O No!  
Not so!  
For honest Souls know,  
Friends and a Bottle still bear the Bell.  
  
Singer.  
  
Then toss off your Glasses, &amp; scorn the dull Asses,  
Who missing the Kernel, still gnaw the Shell.  
What’s Love, Rule or Riches? Wise Solomon teaches  
They’re Vanity, Vanity, Vanity still.  
  
Chorus.  
  
That’s true,  
He knew;  
He ’ad try’d them all through.  
Friends and a Bottle still bore the Bell.
