to be owing to Electric Fire, produced by Friction between the Particles of Water and those of Salt. Living far from the Sea I had then no opportunity of making Experiments on the Sea Water: And so embraced this opinion too hastily.  
For in 1750 and 1751, being occasionally on the Sea Coast, I found, by Experiments, that Sea Water in a Bottle, tho’ at first it would by Agitation appear luminous, yet in a few hours it lost that Virtue; hence, and from this, that I could not by agitating a Solution of Sea Salt in Water produce any Light, I first began to doubt of my former Hypothesis, and to suspect that the luminous appearance in Sea Water must be owing to some othe

ing against non-electric Cushions, draw the electric Fire from the Earth; and that the rising Vapours might receive that fire from the Air, and by such means the Clouds become electrified.  
If this were so, I imagined that by forcing a constant violent Stream of Air against my Prime Conductor, by Bellows, I should electrify it negatively, the rubbing Particles of Air, drawing from it part of its natural Quantity of the electric Fluid. I accordingly made the Experiment, but it did not succeed.  
In September 1752, I erected an Iron Rod to draw the Lightning down into my House, in order to make some Experiments on it, with two Bells to give Notice when the Rod should be electrified. A Contrivance obvious to every Electrician.  
I found the Bells rang sometimes when there was no Lightning or Thunder, but only a dark Cloud over the Rod; that sometimes after a Flash of Lightning they would suddenly stop; and at other times, when they had not rang before, they would, after a Flash, suddenly begin to ring; that the Electricity was sometimes very faint, so that when a small Spark was obtained, another could not be got for sometime after; at other times the Sparks would follow extremely quick, and once I had a continual Stream from Bell to Bell, the size of a Crow-Quill. Even during the same Gust there were considerable variations.  
In the Winter following I conceived an Experiment, to try whether the Clouds were electrified positively, or negatively: but my pointed Rod, with its Apparatus, becoming out of Order, I did not refit it ’till towards the Spring, when I expected the warm Weather would bring on more frequent Thunder Clouds.  
The Experiment was this: To take two Vials, charge one of them with Lightning from the Iron Rod, and give the other an equal Charge by the electric Glass Globe thro’ the prime Conductor: When charged, to place them on a Table within three or four Inches of each other, a small cork Ball being suspended by a fine Silk Thread from the Cieling, so as it might play between the Wires. If both Bottles then were electrify’d positively, the Ball being attracted and repelled by one, must be also repelled by the other. If the one positively, and the other negatively; then the Ball would be attracted and repelled alternately by each, and continue to play between them as long as any considerable Charge remained.

en over the Rod was in the same positive State. This was near the End of the Gust.  
But this was a single Experiment; which however destroys my first too general Conclusion, and reduces me to this, That the Clouds of a Thunder Gust are most commonly in a negative State of Electricity, but sometimes in a positive State.  
The latter I believe is rare; for tho’ I soon after the last Experiment set out on a Journey to Boston, and was from home most part of the Summer, which prevented my making farther Trials and Observations; yet Mr. Kinnersley returning from the Islands just as I left home, pursued the Experiments during my Absence, and informs me, that he always found the Clouds in the negative State.  
So that for the most part in Thunder Strokes, ’tis the Earth that strikes into the Clouds, and not the Clouds that strike into the Earth.  
  
Those who are versed in electrical Experiments, will easily conceive that the Effects and Appearances must be nearly the same in either case; the same Explosion, and the same Flash between one Cloud and another, and between the Clouds and Mountains, &amp;c. the same rending of Trees, Walls, &amp;c. which the electric Fluid meets with in its Passage, and the same fatal Shock to animal Bodies; and that pointed Rods fixt on Buildings or Masts of Ships, and communicating with the Earth, or Sea, must be of the same Service in restoring the Equilibrium silently between the Earth and Clouds, or in conducting a Flash or Stroke, if one should be, so as to save harmless the House or Vessel: For Points have equal Power to throw off, as to draw on the electric Fire, and Rods will conduct up as well as down.  
But tho’ the Light gained from these Experiments makes no Alteration in the Practice, it makes a considerable one in the Theory. And now we as much need an Hypothesis to explain by what means the Clouds become negatively, as before to show how they became positively electrify’d.  
I cannot forbear venturing some few Conjectures on this Occasion; They are what occur to me at present; and tho’ future Discoveries should prove them not wholly right, yet they may in the mean time be of some use, by stirring up the Curious to make more Experiments and occasion more exact Disquisitions.  
I conceive then, that this Globe of Earth and Water, with its Plants, Animals and Buildings, have, diffused thro’out their Substance, a Quantity of the Electric Fluid, just as much as they can contain, which I call the natural Quantity.  
That this natural Quantity is not the same in all kinds of common Matter under the same Dimensions, nor in the same kind of common Matter in all Circumstances; but a solid Foot, for instance, of one kind of common Matter may contain more of the Electric Fluid than a solid Foot of some other kind of common Matter; and a pound weight of the same kind of common Matter, may, when in a rarer State, contain more of the electric Fluid than when in a denser State.  
For the electric Fluid, being attracted by any Portion of common Matter, the Parts of that Fluid, (which have among themselves a mutual Repulsion) are brought so near to each other by the Attraction of the common Matter that absorbs them, as that their Repulsion is equal to the condensing Power of Attraction in common Matter, and then such Portion of common Matter will absorb no more.  
Bodies of different kinds having thus attracted and absorbed what I call their natural Quantity, i.e. just as much of the electric Fluid as is suited to their Circumstances of Density, Rarity, and Power of Attracting, do not then show any Signs of Electricity among each other.  
And if more electric Fluid be added to one of these bodies, it does not enter, but spreads on the Surface, forming an Atmosphere, and then such Body shows Signs of Electricity.  
I have in a former Paper compared common Matter to a Sponge, and the electric Fluid to Water: I beg leave once more to make use of the same Comparison to illustrate farther my Meaning in this particular.  
When a Sponge is somewhat condensed by being squeezed between the Fingers, it will not receive and retain so much Water as when in its more loose and open State.  
If more squeezed and condensed, some of the Water will come out of its inner Parts and flow on the Surface.  
If the Pressure of the Fingers be intirely removed, the Sponge will not only resume what was lately forced out, but attract an additional Quantity.  
As the Sponge in its rarer State will naturally attract and absorb more Water, and in its denser State will naturally attract and absorb less Water; we may call the Quantity it attracts and absorbs in either State, its natural Quantity, the State being considered.  
Now what the Sponge is to Water, the same is Water to the Electric Fluid.  
When a Portion of Water is in its common dense State, it can hold no more electric Fluid than it has; if any be added, it spreads on the Surface.  
When the same Portion of Water is rarifyed into Vapour, and forms a Cloud, it is then capable of receiving and absorbing a much greater Quantity; there is room for each particle to have an electric Atmosphere.  
Thus Water in its rarifyed state, or in the form of a Cloud, will be in a negative State of Electricity; it will have less than its natural Quantity; that is, less than it is naturally capable of attracting and absorbing in that State.  
Such a Cloud, then, coming so near the Earth as to be within the striking Distance, will receive from the Earth a Flash of the Electric Fluid; which Flash, to supply a great extent of Cloud, must sometimes contain a very great Quantity of that Fluid.  
Or such a Cloud, passing over Woods of tall Trees, may from the Points and sharp edges of their moist Top Leaves receive silently some Supply.  
A Cloud being by any means supplied from the Earth may strike into other Clouds that have not been supplied, or not so much supply’d; and those to others, ’till an Equilibrium is produced among all the Clouds that are within striking Distance of each other.  
The Cloud thus supplied, having parted with much of what it first received, may require and receive a fresh Supply from the Earth, or from some other Cloud, which by the wind is brought into such a Situation as to receive it more readily from the Earth.  
Hence repeated and continual Strokes and Flashes ’till the Clouds have all got nearly their natural Quantity as Clouds; or ’till they have descended in Showers, and are united again with this terraqueous Globe, their Original.  
Thus Thunder Clouds are generally in a negative State of Electricity compared with the Earth, agreeable to most of our Experiments; yet as by one Experiment we found a Cloud electrised positively, I conjecture that, in that Case, such Cloud after having received what was, in its rare State, only its natural Quantity, became compressed by the driving Winds, or some other means, so that part of what it had absorbed was forced out, and formed an electric Atmosphere around it in its denser State

er in a clearer Light.  
One seemingly material Objection arises to the new Hypothesis, and it is this. If Water in its rarify’d State as a Cloud, requires and will absorb more of the electric Fluid than when in its dense State as Water, why does it not acquire from the Earth all it wants at the Instant of its leaving the Surface, while it is yet near, and but just rising in Vapour? To this Difficulty I own I cannot at present give a Solution satisfying to myself. I thought however that I ought to state it in its full Force, as I have done, and submit the whole to Examination.  
And I would beg leave to recommend it to the Curious in this Branch of Natural Philosophy, to repeat with care and accurate Observation the Experiments I have reported in this and former Papers relating to positive and negative Electricity, with such other relative ones as shall occur to them, that it may be certainly known whether the Electricity communicated by a Glass Globe be really positive. And also I would request all who may have an Opportunity of observing the recent Effects of Lightning on Buildings, Trees, &amp;c. that they would consider th

aterials for Conducting. Metalline Rods, therefore, of Sufficient Thickness, and extending from the highest Part of an Edifice to the Ground, being of the best Materials and compleat Conductors, will, I think, secure the Building from Damage; either by restoring the Equilibrium so fast as to prevent a Stroke, or by conducting it in the Substance of the Rod as far as the Rod goes, so that there shall be no Explosion, but what is above its Point, between that and the Cloud.

troke in the following manner. An Eye so situated as to view horizontally the under Side of a Thunder Cloud, will see it very ragged, with a Number of separate Fragments or petty Clouds one under another, the lowest sometimes not far from the Earth. These, as so many Stepping-Stones, assist in conducting a Stroke between the Cloud and a Building. To represent these by an Experiment. Take two or three Locks of fine loose Cotton, connect one of them with the Prime Conductor by a fine Thread of two Inches (which may be spun out of the same Lock by the Fingers) another to that, and the third to the second, by like Threads. Turn the Globe, and you will see these Locks extend themselves towards the Table (as the lower small Clouds do towards the Earth) being attracted by it: But on presenting a sharp Point erect under the lowest, it will shrink up to the second, the second to the first, and all together to the Prime Conductor, where they will continue as long as the Point continues under them. May not in like manner, the small electrised Clouds, whose Equilibrium with the Earth is soon restored by the Point, rise up to the main Body, and by that means occasion so large a Vacancy, as that the grand Cloud cannot strike in that Place?

But tho’ the practice is the fame, whether the clouds be  
electrified negatively or pofitively, it is not fo with re-  
yard to the omer ; and we have as much need of an h  
thelis to explain by what means the clouds become negatively,  
as before to fhew how they became pofitively, electrified, This  
Mr. Franklin has attempted to account for, in the following  
manner :  
  
‘ I conceive,’ fays he, ‘ that this globe of earth and water,  
* with its plants, animals, and buildings, have, diffufed through-  
* out their fubftance, a quantity of electric fluid, juft as much as  
* they can contain, which I call the natural quantity.  
  
‘ That this natural quantity is not the fame in all kinds of  
common matter under the fame dimenfions, nor in the fame  
kind of common matter in all circumftances ; but a folid  
foot, for inftance, of one kind of common matter, may con-  
tain more of the electric fluid than a folid foot of fome other  
kind of common matter ; and a pound weight of the fame  
kind of common matter may, when in a rarer ftate, contain  
more of the electric fluid than when in a denfer ftate.  
  
© For the electric fluid, being attra&amp;ted by any portion of  
common matter, the parts of that fluid (which have among  
themfelves a mutual repulfion) are brought fo near to each  
other, by the attraction of the common matter that abforbs  
them, as that their repulfion is equal to the condenfing  
power of attraction in common matter ; and then fuch pos-  
tion of common matter will abforb no more.  
  
© Bodies of different kinds having thus attracted and ab-  
forbed what I call their natural quantity, i. ce. juft as much

‘For DECEMBER, 1754. 419  
  
45 Ihave, in a former paper, compared common matter to  
a {ponge, and the eleétric fluid to water: I beg leave once  
more to make ufe of the fame comparifon, to illuftrate far«  
ther my meaning in this particular.  
  
« When a {ponge is fomewhat condenfed by being fqueezed  
between the fingers, it will not receive and retain io much  
water as when in its more loofe and open ftate.  
  
© If more {queezed and condenfed, fume of the water will  
come out of its inner parts, and flow on the furface.  
  
‘ If the preflure of the fingers be entirely removed, the  
{ponge will not only refume what was lately forced out, but  
attract an additional quantity.  
  
‘ As the fponge in its rarer ftate will xaturally attraé and  
abforb mare water, and in its denfer {tate will naturally ate  
tract and abforb /e/s water, we may call the quantity it at-  
tracts and abforbs in either ftate, its natural guantity, the ftate  
being confidered.  
  
« Now what the fponge is to water, the fame is water to  
the electric fluid,  
  
¢« When a portion of water is in its common denfe ftate, it  
can hold no more electric fluid than it has; if any be added,  
it fpreads on the furface.  
  
« When the fame portion of water is rarified into vapour,  
and forms a cloud, it is then capable of receiving and ab-  
forbing a much greater quantity ; there is room for each par  
ticle to have an electric atmofphere.  
  
¢ Thus water, in its rarified ftate, or in the form of a cloud,  
will be in a negative ftate of electricity ; it will have lefs than  
its natural guzantity ; that is, lefs than it is naturally capable  
of attracting and abforbing in that ftate.  
  
© Such a cloud, then, coming fo near the earth, as to be with-  
in the ftriking diftance, will receive from the earth a flafh  
of the electric uid; which flafh, to fupply a great extent  
of cloud, muft fometimes contain a very great quantity of  
that fluid.  
  
‘ Or fuch a cloud pafling over woods of tail trees, may,  
from the points and fharp edges of their moift top-leaves,  
receive filently fome fupply.  
  
‘ A cloud being by any means fupplied from the earth, may  
ftrike into other clouds that have not been fupplied, or not  
fo much fupplied ; and thole to others, till an equilibrium is  
produced among all the clouds that are within {triking dif-  
tance of eacb other. .

only its natural quantity, became comprefled by the driving  
winds, or fome other means, fo that part of that it had ab-  
forbed, was forced out, and formed an electric atmofphere

it is in its denfe ftate as water, why does it not acquire, from  
the earth, all it wants, at the inftant of its leaving the furface,

a fine silk thread from the ceiling, so as to play between the wires. If  
both bottles then were electrified positively, the ball being attracted and  
then repelled by the one, must be repelled by the other. If the one

‘In September, 1752, I erected an iron rod to draw the light-  
ening down into my house,’’ Franklin writes to Collinson, a year  
later, ‘‘in order to make some experiments on it with two: bells, to  
give notice when the rod should be electrify’d, a contrivance ob-  
vious to every electrician. I found the bells rang sometimes when  
there was no lightning or thunder, but only a dark cloud over the  
rod ; that sometimes, after a flash of lightning, they would sud-  
denly stop, and at other times, when they had not rang before,  
they would, after a flash, suddenly begin to ring; that the elec-  
tricity was sometimes very faint, so that when a small spark was  
obtain’d another could not be got for some time after; at other  
times the sparks would follow extremely quick ; and once I had a  
continual stream from bell to bell the size of a crow quill. Even  
during the same gust there were considerable variations.’’ The fol-  
lowing winter he charged two phials, one with lightning from the  
iron rod, the other, equally, by the electric glass globe, and sus
