Sir  
Passy Sept. 30. 1779.  
I received but Yesterday Morning just as I was going out of Town; the Letter you did me the honour of writing to me dated the 26 Inst. respecting my supplying you with Money for your Support in Spain. As I cannot furnish that Expence, and there is not, in my Opinion, any likelihood at present of your being received at that Court, I think your Resolution of returning forthwith to America, is both wise &amp; honest.  
With great Respect, I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient and most humble Servant  
B Franklin
