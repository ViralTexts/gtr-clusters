 and then, it is done with a Stroke and Crack. As the Pasteboard Tube hangs loose on Silk Lines; when you approach it with the Punch Iron, it likewise will move towards the Punch; being attracted, while it is charg’d. But if at the same Instant a Point be presented, as before, it retires again, for the Point discharges it.  
Take a Pair of large Brass Scales, of two (or more) Feet Beam; the Cords of the Scales being Silk. Suspend the Beam by a Packthread from the Cieling, so that the Bottom of the Scales may be about a Foot from the Floor. The Scales will move round in a Circle by the Untwisting of the Packthread. Set the Iron Punch on End upon the Floor, in such a Place, as that the Scales may pass over it, in making their Circle; then Electrify one Scale by applying the Wire of a charged Vial to it. As they move round, you see the Scale draw nigher to the Floor, and dip more when it comes over the Punch; and if that be placed at a proper Distance, the Scale will snap and discharge it’s Fire into it. But if a Needle be stuck on the End of the Punch, it’s Point upwards, the Scale instead of drawing nigh to the Punch and snapping, discharges it’s Fire silently, thro’ the Point, and rises higher from the Punch. Nay even if the Needle be plac’d upon the Floor, near the Punch, it’s Point upwards, the End of the Punch tho’ so much higher than the Needle, will not attract the Scale and receive it’s Fire, for the Needle will get it and convey it away, before it comes nigh enough for the Punch to act. And this is constantly observable in these Experiments, that the greater Quantity of Electricity in the Pastboard Tube, the farther it strikes or discharges its Fire. And the Point likewise will draw it off at a still greater Distance.  
Now if the Fire of Electricity, and that of Lightning, be the same; as I have endeavoured to shew at large in a former Paper; this Pastboard Tube and these Scales may represent electrified Clouds. If a Tube only 10 Foot long, will strike and discharge it’s Fire on the Punch at 2 or 3 Inches Distance; an electrified Cloud of perhaps 10,000 Acres may strike and discharge on the Earth at a proportionably greater Distance. The horizontal Motion of the Scales over the Floor may represent the Motion of the Clouds over the Earth, and the Erect Iron Punch a Hill or high Building: and then we see how electrified Clouds passing over Hills or high Buildings, at too great a Height to strike, may be attracted lower till within their striking Distance. And lastly if a Needle fixt on the Punch, with it’s Point upright, or even on the Floor, below the Punch, will draw the Fire from the Scale silently at a much greater than the striking Distance and so prevent it’s descending towards the Punch; Or if in it’s Course, it would have come nigh enough to strike, yet, being first deprived of it’s Fire it cannot; and the Punch is thereby secured from the Stroke. I say, if these Things are so, may not the Knowledge of this Power of Points be of Use to Mankind; in preserving Houses, Churches, Ships &amp;c. from the Stroke of Lightning; by Directing us to fix on the highest Parts of those Edifices upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground; or down round one of the Shrouds of a Ship and down her Side, till it reach’d the Water? Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!  
21. To determine the Question, Whether the Clouds that contain Lightning are electrified or not, I would propose an Experiment to be try’d where it may be done conveniently.  
On the Top of some high Tower or Steeple, place a Kind of Sentry Box big enough to contain a Man and an electrical Stand. From the Middle of the Stand let an Iron Rod rise, and pass bending out of the Door, and then upright 20 or 30 feet, pointed very sharp at the End. If the Electrical Stand be kept clean and dry, a Man standing on it when such Clouds are passing low, might be electrified, and afford Sparks, the Rod drawing Fire to him from the Cloud. If any Danger to the Man should be apprehended (tho’ I think there would be none) let him stand on the Floor of his Box, and now and then bring near to the Rod, the Loop of a Wire, that has one End fastened to the Leads; he holding it by a Wax-Handle. So the Sparks, if the Rod is electrified, will Strike from the Rod to the Wire and not affect him.  
22. Before I leave this Subject of Lightning, I may mention some other Similarities between the Effects of that and those of Electricity. Lightning has often been known to strike People blind. A Pigeon that we struck dead to Appearance by the Electrical Shock, recovering Life, droopt

The Stains on the upper and under Glass are exactly similar in the Minutest Stroak, as may be seen by holding them to the Light. The Metal appears to have been not only melted, but even to be vitrified, or otherwise so driven into the Pores of the Glass as to be protected by it from the Action of the strongest Aqua fortis or Aqua Regia.

Hence we see the Impossibility of Success in the Experiments proposed to draw out the effluvial Virtues of a Non-electric as Cinnamon for Instance, and mixing them with the Electrical Fluid, to convey them with that into the Body, by including it in the Globe, and then Applying Friction &amp;c. For tho’ the Effluvia of Cinnamon and the Electrical Fluid, should mix within the Globe, they would never come out together thro’ the Pores of the Glass, and so go to the Prime Conductor. For the Electrical Fluid itself can not come thro’, and the Prime Conductor is always supply’d from the Cushion, and that from the Floor.

fied body more rapidly than a blunt one. He suspended a scale-  
beam by a pack-thread from the ceiling of a room, and to the ends  
of the beam he attached a pair of large brass scales by silk  
cords. One of the scales was electrified, and an iron punch was  
set on the end upon the floor. The scales moved round in a  
circle by the untwisting of the pack-thread ; and when the charged  
scale came over the punch, it dipped toward it, and discharged its  
electricity in the form of a spark. But when a needle was fastened  
to the end of the punch, the electricity was discharged silently,  
without the scale dipping toward the point.  
  
Now, says Franklin, if the fire of electricity, and that of light-  
  
ning, be the same, as I have endeavored to show at large in a  
  
former paper, these scales may represent electrified clouds. The  
horizontal motion of the scales over the floor may represent the  
motion of the clouds over the earth; and the erect iron punch, a  
hill or high building; and then we see how electrified clouds,  
passing over hills or high buildings at too great a height to strike,  
may be attracted lower, till within their striking distance. And if  
a needle, fixed on the punch with its point upright, will draw the  
fire from the scale silently, at a much greater than the striking  
distance, may not the knowledge of this power of points be of  
some use to mankind in preserving houses, churches, and ships  
from lightning? Would not pointed rods of metal, extending from  
the highest parts of those edifices to the earth or water, probably  
draw the electrical fire silently out of a cloud before it came near  
enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and  
terrible mischief ?*  
  
So fully is this sagacious man possessed of the idea that light-  
ning is electricity, that he immediately proceeds to describe the  
experiment by which their identity may be demonstrated. His  
directions are as follows :—  
  
“On the top of some high tower, or steeple, place a kind of sentry-  
box, big enough to contain a man and an electrical stand. From the  
middle of the stand let an iron rod rise and pass, bending out of the  
  
door, and then upright, twenty or thirty feet, pointed very sharp at the

respondence, p. 49.  
  
Franklin also brings forward in this paper some new analogies  
between the éffects of electricity and lightning. Lightning had  
been known to strike people blind; he made a chicken blind by an

it to give a spark at the distance of two inches,  
strong enough, as he said, “to make one’s

a needle to the conductor, at more than a foot

‘** Place a narrow strip of leaf gold between two strips of glass, with  
ends hanging out loose beyond the glass. Bind the glasses together  
with silk, and send the flash coat it from a large electrified jar. Then,  
if your strips of glass remain whole, you will see in several places a  
metallic stain on both the glasses. The metal appears to have been not

the glass as to be protected by it from the action of the strongest aqua

ruptive electric discharge, to rend apart the particles of bodies with a

Even before the identity of electricity and

argued as early as 1749, “may not the know-

mankind, in preserving houses, churches,  
ships, &amp;c from the stroke of lightning, by  
directing us to fix, on the highest parts of  
those edifices, upright rods of iron made  
sharp as a needle, and gilt to prevent rust-

down the outside of the building into the  
ground, or down round one of the shrouds  
of a ship, and down her side till it reaches  
the water? Would not these pointed rods
