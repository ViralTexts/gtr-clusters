When I consider my own Weakness, and the discerning Judgment of those who are to be my Audience, I cannot help blaming my self considerably, for this rash Undertaking of mine, it being a Thing I am altogether ill practis’d in and very much unqualified for; I am especially discouraged when I reflect that you are all my intimate Pot Companions who have heard me say a 1000 silly Things in Conversations, and therefore have not that laudable Partiality and Veneration for whatever I shall deliver that Good People commonly have for their Spiritual Guides; that You have no Reverence for my Habit, nor for the Sanctity of my Countenance; that you do not believe me inspir’d or divinely assisted, and therefore will think your Selves at Liberty to assent or dissent agree [written above: approve] or disagree [written above: disapprove] of any Thing I advance, canvassing and sifting it as the private Opinion of one of your Acquaintance.

he Authority of Reason itself. It might be judg’d an Affront to your Understandings should I go about to prove this first Principle, the Existence of a Deity and that he is the Creator of the Universe, for that would suppose you ignorant of what all Mankind in all Ages have agreed in. I shall therefore proceed to observe: 1. That he must be a Being of great Wisdom; 2. That he must be a Being of great Goodness and 3. That he must be a Being of great Power. That he must be a Being of infinite Wisdom, appears in his admirable Order and Disposition of Things, whether we consider the heavenly Bodies, the Stars and Planets, and their wonderful regular Motions, or this Earth compounded of such an Excellent mixture of all the Elements; or the admirable Structure of Animal Bodies of such infinite Variety, and yet every one adapted to its Nature, and the Way of Life it is to be placed in, whether on Earth, in the Air or in the Waters, and so exactly that the highest and most exquisite human Reason, cannot find a fault and say this would have been better so or in another Manner, which whoever considers attentively and thoroughly will be astonish’d and swallow’d up in Admiration.  
2. That the Deity is a Being of great Goodness, appears in his giving Life to so many Creatures, each of which acknowledge it a Benefit by their unwillingness to leave it; in his providing plentiful Sustenance for them all, and making those Things that are most useful, most common and easy to be had; such as Water necessary for almost every Creature’s Drink; Air without which few could subsist, the inexpressible Benefits of Light and Sunshine to almost all Animals in general; and to Men the most useful Vegetables, such as Corn, the most useful of Metals as Iron, and the most useful Animals, as Horses, Oxen and Sheep, he has made easiest to raise, or procure in Quantity or Numbers: each of which particulars if considered seriously and carefully would fill us with the highest Love and Affection. 3. That he is a Being of infinite Power appears, in his being able to form and compound such Vast Masses of Matter as this Earth and the Sun and innumerable Planets and Stars, and give them such prodigious Motion, and yet so to govern them in their greatest Velocity as that they shall not flie off out of their appointed Bounds nor dash one against another, to their mutual Destruction; but ’tis easy to conceive his Power, when we are convinc’d of his infinite Knowledge and Wisdom; for if weak and foolish Creatures as we are, by knowing the Nature of a few Things can produce such wonderful Effects; such as for instance by knowing the Nature only of Nitre and Sea Salt mix’d we can make a Water which will dissolve the hardest Iron and by adding one Ingredient more, can make another Water which will dissolve Gold and render the most Solid Bodies fluid—and by knowing the Nature of Salt Peter Sulphur and Charcoal those mean Ingredients mix’d we can shake the Air in the most terrible Manner, destroy Ships Houses and Men at a Distance and in an Instant, overthrow Cities, rend Rocks into a Thousand Pieces, and level the highest Mountains. What Power must he possess who not only knows the Nature of every Thing in the Universe, but can make Things of new Natures with the greatest Ease and at his Pleasure!  
Agreeing then that the World was at first made by a Being of infinite Wisdom, Goodness and Power, which Being we call God; The State of Things ever since and at this Time must be in one of these four following manners, viz.  
1. Either he unchangeably decreed and appointed every Thing that comes to pass; and left nothing to the Course [of] Nature, nor allow’d any Creature free agency. or  
2. Without decreeing any thing, he left all to general Nature and the Events of Free Agency in his Creatures, which he never alters or interrupts. or  
3. He decreed some Things unchangeably, and left others to general Nature and the Events of Free agency, which also he never alters or interrupts; or  
4. He sometimes interferes by his particular Providence and sets aside the Effects which would otherwise have been produced by any of the Above Causes.  
  
I shall endeavour to shew the first 3 Suppositions to be inconsistent with the common Light of Reason; and that the 4th is most agreeable to it, and therefore most probably true.  
In the 1. place. If you say he has in the Beginning unchangedably decreed all Things and left Nothing to Nature or free Agency. These Strange Conclusions will necessarily follow; 1. That he is now no more a God. ’Tis true indeed, before he had made such unchangeable Decree, he was a Being of Power, Almighty; but now having determin’d every Thing, he has divested himself of all further Power, he has done and has no more to do, he has ty’d up his Hands, and has now no greater Power than an Idol of Wood or Stone; nor can there be any more Reason for praying to him or worshipping of him, than of such an Idol for the Worshippers can be never the better for such Worship. Then 2. he has decreed some things contrary to the very Notion of a wise and good Being; Such as that some of his Creatures or Children shall do all Manner of Injury to others and bring every kind of Evil upon them without Cause; that some of them shall even blaspheme him their Creator in the most horrible manner; and, which is still more highly absurd that he has decreed the greatest Part of Mankind, shall in all Ages, put up their earnest Prayers to him both in private and publickly in great Assemblies, when all the while he had so determin’d their Fate that he could not possibly grant them any Benefits on that Account, nor could such Prayers be any way available. Why then should he ordain them to make such Prayers? It cannot be imagined they are of any Service to him. Surely it is not more difficult to believe the World was made by a God of Wood or Stone, than that the God who made the World should be such a God as this.  
In the 2. Place. If you say he has decreed nothing but left all things to general Nature, and the Events of Free Agency, which he never alters or interrupts. Then these Conclusions will follow; He must either utterly hide him self from the Works of his Hands, and take no Notice at all of their Proceedings natural or moral; or he must be as undoubtedly he is, a Spectator of every thing; for there can be no Reason or Ground to suppose the first—I say there can be no Reason to imagine he would make so glorious a Universe meerly to abandon it. In this Case imagine the Deity looking on and beholding the Ways of his Creatures; some Hero’s in Virtue he sees are incessantly indeavouring the Good of others, they labour thro vast difficulties, they suffer incredible Hardships and Miseries to accomplish this End, in hopes to please a Good God, and obtain his Favour, which they earnestly Pray for; what Answer can he make them within himself but this; take the Reward Chance may give you, I do not intermeddle in these Affairs; he sees others continually doing all manner of Evil, and bringing by their Actions Misery and Destruction among Mankind: What can he say here but this, if Chance rewards you I shall not punish you, I am not to be concerned. He sees the just, the innocent and the Beneficent in the Hands of the wicked and violent Oppressor; and when the good are at the Brink of Destruction they pray to him, thou, O God, art mighty and powerful to save; help us we beseech thee: He answers, I cannot help you, ’tis none of my Business nor do I at all regard these things. How is it possible to believe a wise and an infinitely Good Being can be delighted in this Circumstance; and be utterly unconcern’d what becomes of the Beings and Things he has created; for thus, we must believe him idle and unactive, and that his glorious Attributes of Power, Wisdom and Goodness are no more to be made use of.  
In the Third Place. If you say he has decreed some things and left others to the Events of Nature and Free Agency, Which he never alters or interrupts; Still you unGod him, if I may be allow’d the Expression; he has nothing to do; he can cause us neither Good nor Harm; he is no more to be regarded than a lifeless Image, than Dagon, or Baall, or Bell and the Dragon; and as in both the other Suppositions foregoing, that Being which from its Power is most able to Act, from its Wisdom knows best how to act, and from its Goodness would always certainly act best, is in this Opinion supposed to become the most unactive of all Beings and remain everlastingly Idle; an Absurdity, which when considered or but barely seen, cannot be swallowed without doing the greatest Violence to common Reason, and all the Faculties of the Understanding.  
We are then necessarily driven into the fourth Supposition, That the Deity sometimes interferes by his particular Providence, and sets aside the Events which would otherwise have been produc’d in the Course of Nature, or by the Free Agency of Men; and this is perfectly agreeable with what we can know of his Attributes and Perfections: But as some may doubt whether ’tis possible there should be such a Thing as free Agency in Creatures; I shall just offer one Short Argument on that Account and proceed to shew how the Duties of Religion necessary follow the Belief of a Providence. You acknowledge that God is infinitely Powerful, Wise and Good, and also a free Agent; and you will not deny that he has communicated to us part of his Wisdom, Power and Goodness; i.e. he has made us in some Degree Wise, potent and good; and is it then impossible for him to communicate any Part of his Freedom, and make us also in some Degree Free? Is not even his infinite Power sufficient for this? I should be glad to hear what Reason any Man can give for thinking in that Manner; ’tis sufficient for me to shew tis not impossible, and no Man I think can shew ’tis improbable, but much more might be offer’d to demonstrate clearly that Men are in some Degree free Agents, and accountable for their Actions; however, this I may possibly reserve for another separate Discourse hereafter if I find Occasion.  
Lastly If God does not sometimes interfere by his Providence tis either because he cannot, or because he will not; which of these Positions will you chuse? There is a righteous Nation grievously oppress’d by a cruel Tyrant, they earnestly intreat God to deliver them; If you say he cannot, you deny his infinite Power, which [you] at first acknowledg’d; if you say he will not, you must directly deny his infinite Goodness. You are then of necessity oblig’d to allow, that ’tis highly reasonable to believe a Providence because tis highly absurd to believe otherwise.  
Now if tis unreasonable to suppose it out of the Power of the Deity to help and favour us particularly or that we are out of his Hearing or Notice or that Good Actions do not procure more of his Favour than ill Ones. Then I conclude, that believing a Providence we have the Foundation of all true Religion; for we should love and revere that Deity for his Goodness and thank him for his Benefits; we should adore him for his Wisdom, fear him for his Power, and pray to him for his Favour and Protection; and this Religion will be a Powerful Regulater of our Actions, give us Peace and Tranquility within our own Minds, and render us Benevolent, Useful and Beneficial to others.

When I consider my own weakness and the discern-  
ing judgment of those who are to be my audience, I  
cannot help blaming myself considerably for this rash  
undertaking of mine, being a thing I am altogether un-  
practiced in and very much unqualified for; but I am  
especially discouraged when I reflect that you are all  
my intimate pot companions, who have heard me say a  
thousand silly things in conversation, and therefore have  
not that laudable partiality and veneration for whatever  
I shall deliver that good people commonly have for their  
spiritual guides ; that you have no reverence for my  
habit nor for the sanctity of my countenance ; that you  
do not believe me inspired or divinely assisted, and  
therefore will think yourselves at liberty to assert or  
dissert, approve or disapprove of any thing I advance,  
canvassing and sifting it as the private opinion of one  
of your acquaintance. These are great disadvantages  
and discouragements, but I am entered and must pro-  
ceed, humbly requesting your patience and attention.  
  
I propose at this time to discourse on the subject of  
our last conversation, the Providence of God in the go-  
vernment of the world. It might be judged an affront  
to your understandings should I go about to prove this  
first principle, the existence of a Deity, and that he is  
the Creator of the Universe, for that would suppose you  
ignorant of what all mankind in all ages have agreed in.  
I shall therefore proceed to observe that he must be a  
being of infinite wisdom, as appears in his admirable  
order and disposition of things, whether we consider the  
heavenly bodies, the stars and planets and their won-  
derful regular motions, or this earth compounded of such  
an excellent mixture of all the elements; or the admira-  
ble structure of animate bodies of such infinite variety,  
and yet every one adapted to its nature and the way of  
life it is to be placed in, whether on earth, in the air, or  
in the water, and so exactly that the highest and most  
exquisite human reason cannot find a fault and say this  
would have been better so, or in such a manner, which  
whoever considers attentively and thorouglily will be  
astonished and swallowed up in admiration.

That the Deity is a being of great goodness, appears  
in his giving life to so many creatures each of which  
acknowledge it a benefit, by their unwillingness to leave  
it; in his providing plentiful sustenance for them all,  
and making those things that are most useful, most com-  
mon and easy to be had; such as water, necessary for  
almost every creature to drink; air, without which few  
could subsist; the inexpressible benefits of light and  
sunshine to almost all animals in general; and to men  
the most useful vegetable such as corn, the most useful  
of metals as iron &amp;c, the most useful animals as horses,  
oxen and sheep he has made easiest to raise or procure  
in quantity or numbers ; each of which particulars, if  
considered seriously and carefully, would fill us with the  
highest love and affection.  
  
That he is a being of infinite power appears in his  
being able to form and compound such vast masses of  
matter, as this earth and the sun and innumerable stars  
and planets, and give them such prodigious motion, and  
yet so to govern them in their greatest velocity as that  
they shall not fly out of their appointed bounds, nor  
dash one against another for their mutual destruction.  
But ’tis easy to conceive his power, when we are con-  
vinced of his infinite knowledge and wisdom; for if  
weak and foolish creatures as we are by knowing the  
nature of a few things can produce such wonderful  
effects; such as for instance, by knowing the nature  
only of nitre and sea salt mixed we can make a water  
which will dissolve the hardest iron, and by adding one  
ingredient more can make another water which will dis-  
solve gold, and make the most sclid bodies fluid, and by  
knowing the nature of saltpetre, sulphur and charcoal,  
those mean ingredients mixed, we can shake the air in  
the most terrible manner, destroy ships, houses and men  
at a distance, and in an instant, overthrow cities, and  
rend rocks into a thousand pieces, and level the highest  
mountains; what power must he possess who not only  
knows the nature of every thing in the universe, but  
can make things of new natures with the greatest ease  
and at his pleasure ?  
  
Agreeing then that the world was at first made by a  
being of infinite wisdom, goodness and power, which  
being we call God, the state of things existing at this  
time must be in one of these four following manners—  
viz.  
  
1. Either he unchangeably decreed and appointed  
every thing that comes to pass, and lefi nothing to the  
course of nature, nor allowed any creature free agency.  
  
2. Without decreeing any thing he left all to general  
nature and the events of free agency in his creatures  
which he never alters or interrupts; or,  
  
3. He decreed some things unchangeably, and left  
others to general nature and the events of free agency  
which also he never alters or interrupts; or,  
  
4, He sometimes interferes by his particular provi-  
dence and sets aside the effects which would otherwise  
have been produced by any of the above causes.

that the fourth is most agreeable toit and therefore most  
probably true.  
  
In the first place. If you say he has in the beginning  
unchangeably decreed all things and left nothing to na-  
ture or freeagency, these strange conclusions will neces-  
sarily follow, 1. That he is now no more a God. It is  
true indeed before he made such unchangeable decree,  
he was a being of power almighty ; but now having  
determined every thing he has divested himself of all  
further power, he has done and has no more to do, he  
has tied up his hands and has now no greater power  
than an idol of wood or stone; nor can there be any  
more reason for praying to him or worshipping of him  
than of such an idol, for the worshippers can never be  
better for such worship. Then, 2. He has decreed some  
things contrary to the very notion of a wise and good  
being ; such as that some of his creatures or children  
shall do all manner of injury to others, and bring every  
kind of evil upon them without cause ; that some of them  
shall even blaspheme him their Creator, in the most hor-  
rible manner; and which is still more highly absurd,  
that he has decreed, that the greatest part of mankind  
shall in all ages put up their earnest prayers to him both  
in private and publicly, in great assemblies, when all  
the while he had so determined their fate that he could  
not possibly grant them any benefits on that account,  
nor could such prayers be in any way available. Why  
then should he ordain them to make such prayers? It  
cannot be imagined that they are of any service to him.  
Surely it is not more difficult to believe the world was  
made by a God of wood or stone, than that the God  
who made the world should be such a God as this.  
  
In the second place. If you say he has decreed no-  
thing, but left all things to general nature and the events  
of free agency, which he never alters or interrupts, then  
these conclusions will follow; he must either utterly  
hide himself from the works of his own hands and take  
no notice at all of their proceedings natural or moral,  
or he must be, as undoubtedly he is, a spectator of every  
thing, for there can be no reason or ground to suppose  
the first. I say there can be no reason to imagine he  
would make so glorious a universe merely to abandon it.  
In this case imagine the deity looking on and beholding  
the ways of his creatures, Some heroes in virtue he  
sees are incessantly endeavoring the good of others :  
they labor through vast difficulties, they suffer incre-  
dible hardships and miseries to accomplish this end, in  
hopes to please a good God, and attain his favors which  
they earnestly pray for, what answer can he make then  
within himself but this? Take the reward chance may  
give you, I do not intermeddle in these affairs. He sees  
others continually doing all manner of evil, and bring-  
ing by their actions misery and destruction among man-  
kind, what can he say here but this, if chance rewards  
you I shall not punish you, I am not to be concerned. He  
sees the just, the innocent, and the beneficent in the hands  
of the wicked and violent oppressor, and when the good  
are at the brink of destruction they pray to him, Thou  
  
O God art mighty and powerful to save, help us we beseech  
thee! He answers, J cannot help you, it is none of my busi-  
ness, nor do I at all regard these things. How is it pos-  
sible to believe a wise and an infinitely good being can  
be delighted in this circumstance, and be utterly un-  
concerned what becomes of the beings and things he has  
created? for thus, we must believe him idle and inac-  
  
  
  
tive, and that his glorious attributes of power, wisdom,  
and goodness are no more to be made use of.  
  
In the third place. If you say he has decreed some  
things and left others to the events of nature and free  
agency, which he never alters or interrupts; still you  
un-God him if I may be allowed the expression—he has  
nothing todo; he can cause us neither good nor harm;  
he is no more to be regarded than a lifeless image, than  
Dagon or Baal, or Bell and the Dragon, and as in both  
the other suppositions foregoing, that being which from  
its power is most able to act, from its wisdom knows  
best how to act, and from its goodness would always  
certainly act best, is in this opinion suppesed to become  
the most inactive of all beings, and remain everlastingly  
idle: an absurdity which when considered or but barely  
seen, cannot be swallowed without doing the greatest  
violence to common reason and all the faculties of the  
understanding.  
  
We are then necessarily driven to the fourth suppo-  
sition, that the Deity sometimes interferes by his parti-  
cular Providence, and sets,aside the events which would  
otherwise have been produced in the course of nature  
or by the free agency of men, and this is perfectly  
agreeable with what we can know of his attributes and  
perfections. But as some may doubt whether it is possi-  
ble there should be such a thing as free agency in crea-  
tures, I shall just offer one short argument on that ac-  
count, and proceed to show how the duty of religion  
necessarily follows the belief of a providence. You  
acknowledge that God is infinitely powerful, wise and  
good, and also a free agent, and you will not deny that  
he has communicated to us part of his wisdom, power  
and goodness; that is, he has made us in some degree,  
wise, potent and good. And is it then impossible for  
him to communicate any part of his freedom, and make  
us also in some degree free? Is not even his infinite  
power sufficient for this? I should be glad to hear  
what reason any man can give for thinking in that man-  
ner. It is sufficient for me to show it is not impossible,  
and no man, I think, can show it is improbable. Much  
more might be offered to demonstrate clearly, that men  
are in some degree free agents and accountable for their  
actions; however, this I may possibly reserve for  
another separate discourse hereafter, if I find occasion,  
  
Lastly. If God does not sometimes interfere by his  
providence, it is either because he cannot, or because he  
will not. Which of these positions will you choose?  
There is a righteous nation grievously oppressed by a  
cruel tyrant, they earnestly intreat God to deliver them.  
If you say he cannot, you deny his infinite power, which  
[you] at first acknowledged. If you say he will not,  
you must directly dery his infinite goodness. You are  
of necessity obliged to allow that it is highly reasona-  
ble to believe a providence, because it is highly absurd  
to believe otherwise.  
  
Now, if it is unreasonable to suppose it out of the  
power of the Deity to help and favor us particularly, or  
that we are out of his hearing and notice, or that good  
actions do not procure more of his favor than ill ones;  
then I conclude, that believing a providence, we have  
the foundation of all true religion, for we should love  
and revere that Deity for his goodness, and thank him  
for his benefits; we should adore him for his wisdom,  
fear him for his power, and pray to him for his favor and  
protection, And this religion will be a powerful regu

Ihe stale of things existing at this limej  
tnnsi be in one of these four following ,  
manners — vi&#x27;z, I  
  
1. Either he unchangeiihly decreed&#x27;  
  
and appi’iiiled even thing that comes tnj  
pass and left nulhiiig to the cour.-e ol j  
nature, nor allowed any creature free,  
ageiicv. j  
  
2. Without^ decreeing any Ihing hci  
  
left all lo general nature anti the events  
of free agency in his creatures which i  
he never alters or mterrupis or, j  
  
3. lie decreed some things nnehnngea-&#x27;  
Illy and left others lo general nature and^  
the events of free agency which also he,  
never alters nr interrupts ; or  
  
4. He sometime interferes hy his p ir-  
liciilar providence, and sets aside the  
eflects which would otherwise have  
been produced by any of the above cau-  
se!.  
  
I shall endeavor to show Ihe first sup-;  
posiiion.s lo be inconsistent with the com  
mon light of reason and ihit the four h  
is most agree. ihle to it, and therelore  
probable,  
  
In the first place. If you say he haS|  
  
in ihc i.oginnini; Of loKa iij^eabl y deciccd  
a&#x27;l ibiiigs and left n, ailing 111 nature I 1  
free agency, these strange c inclusions  
will necessarily follow, 1. That he i-  
iiow no more a God. It is true iiidei&#x27;d.  
before lie made such tinchangealile de  
crees he w as a being &lt;if power almigh y ;  
Init now having determined every thiiig  
he has divested himself of all further  
power, he h is done and has no ni.ire to  
do, he has tied up his hands and has  
now no greater power than an idol of  
wood or stone; nor can there he any  
more reason for praying to him or wor-j  
shipping of him than of such aii idol, f &gt;r,  
the worshippers can never be better tor  
such worship Then, 2. He has decreed  
some things contrari to the very t otioii  
of a wise and good being; sucli as ihat^  
soiiie of his creatures or children shall  
da all manner of injury to others, and  
bring everv kind of evil upon them with-i  
out cause; that some of them shall even^  
lilas|iheme him their Creator, in Ihe hor-i  
I&#x27;ilile manner; and which is still iiiore|  
abused; that be has decreed, that tho^  
greatest part of mankind shall in hIIi  
ages pul up their earnest praycis to him,  
both in private and piibliclv in great as |  
scmblies, when all &lt;he while he had so  
determined their fate that he could noi ;  
possibly grant them anv benefits on that,  
account, nor could such prayers be in  
any way available. Why iheii 8b iuid|  
he ordain them to make siii h prayers?

pray to him. Thou 0 God art mighty  
and powerful to sure, help us ne beseech  
thee! He answers, / cannot help you, it  
is none of my business, Ido not at all re-  
gard these tilings. How is it possible to  
believe a wise und infinitely good being  
can be delighted in this circumstance,  
and be nlierly unconcerned what be-  
comes of tho beings and ibitigs be has  
created? for thus, we must believe him  
idle and inactive, and that his glorious  
attributes of power, wisdom, and good-  
ness are no more to be made use of.  
  
In the third place. If you say he has  
decreed some things and left others lo  
the events of nature and free agency,  
which he neverallers or inteinipis ; still  
you tin Gadhtm, if I may be allowed the  
expression — he has nothing lo do; he  
can cause ns neither good nor harm; he  
is no mote to be regarded than a lifeless  
image, than D.igon or Baal, or Bell and  
  
the Dragon, and as in both theo-hersup-  
posi&#x27;ioiis foiegoing, lliat being which  
from ils power is most able lo art, from  
its w isdom knows best how to act, tiiidl  
from its would ^ll^vil^s coit-iin-  
  
Iv act best, is in Ibis opinion supposed  
til become the m«el iiiticlii e of all beings,,  
and remain evei hisiingly iilie: an .il.-  
siirdi&#x27;v which w hen considered or but  
barely seen, cannot be swallowed with-  
out do.ng the greatest violence to com-  
iiioii reason and all the facullies of ihe-  
underslaiiiliiig.  
  
We are ihen necessurih ilrivcn to the  
fourth sup &#x27;nsiiion. that ihe Deity some-  
times iiilei feres by his pariiciilar 1‘rovi-  
dence, and sets aside the event.s which  
would oihcrwise have been produced in-  
the course of iialiire, or by the free a.  
geiicy of men, and ihis is perfectly agree  
able w i h what we can know ol his at-  
tribiiles and&#x27; pei fections. Bii as some  
may doubt whether it is possible that  
there sh&#x27; uhl he such a ihing as free a-  
geiicy in creatures, 1 shall just offer one  
short argiinienl on that account, and pro-,  
ceed lo show the duly of religion neces-  
sarily follows the behalf of a Providei.ee.  
You acknowledge that God is infinitely  
powerful, wise and good, and also a free  
agent, an.l you will nol deny Ihal he has  
coimniinicaled to us part of his wisdom,  
power and goodness; that is, he has  
made us in some degree, wise, potent  
and good. And is it Ihen impossible for  
him to c iinmiinicale any part of his free-^&quot;  
dum, and make us also in some degree  
free? Is noi even his infinite power suf-  
firent for Ihis? I should be glad In hear  
what reason any man ctin give fur think-  
ing in that manner. It is sufficient for  
me to show it is not impossible, and no  
man, I think, can show it improbable,.  
.Much in&#x27;iie might he afforded to demon  
strate clearly , that men are in some de-  
gree free agents and iinaccoiiiitable Ibr  
ilieii- actions; however, this 1 ma\ p,.ssi-  
lilv reserve lor another separate dis-  
course hereafter, if I find occasion.  
  
Lisllv. If God does nut soinelimes  
inlei fere hy hi.-i providence, it ft either  
liecaose he cannoi, or because he will  
not. — Which of these positions w ill vou  
i.&#x27;hoose? There is a righteous nation  
greviously oppo.sed by a cruel tyrant,  
Ihev, earnestly entreat God to deliver  
them. If you say he cannot, you deny  
Ids jiifimte power, w hich [vou] at first  
acknowledged. If &gt;.ou say he will not,  
you directly deny his infinilc goodness.  
You are of nccessilv obliged to allow  
that it is highly reasonable to believe a  
proviilenee, because it is highly absured  
to believe otherwise.
