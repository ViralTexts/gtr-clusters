Ever made by the hand above?<br/>
A woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life—<br/>
And a woman&#x27;s wonderful love?<br/>
<br/>
Do you know you have asked for the priceless thing<br/>
As a child might ask for a toy?<br/>
Demanding what others have died to win,<br/>
With the reckless dash of a boy?<br/>
<br/>
You have written my lesson of duty out—<br/>
Man-like you have questioned me;<br/>
Now stand at the bar of woman&#x27;s soul,<br/>
Until I shall question thee.<br/>
<br/>
You require your mutton shall be always hot,<br/>
Your socks and shirts be whole;<br/>
I require your heart to be true as a God&#x27;s stars,<br/>
And pure as Heaven your soul.<br/>
<br/>
You require a cook for your mutton and beef,<br/>
I require a far greater thing;<br/>
A seamstress you&#x27;re wanting for sock and for shirts,<br/>
I look for a man and a king—<br/>
<br/>
A king for the beautiful realm called home,<br/>
And a man that the Maker, God<br/>
Shall look upon as He did on the first,<br/>
And say, &quot;It is very good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade,<br/>
From my soft, young cheek one day—<br/>
Will you love me then &#x27;mid the falling leaves<br/>
As you did &#x27;mong the blooms of May?<br/>
<br/>
Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep<br/>
I may launch my all on its tide!<br/>
A loving woman finds heaven or hell<br/>
On the day she is made a bride.<br/>
<br/>
I require all things that are good and true,<br/>
All things that a man should be;<br/>
If you give this all, I would stake my life<br/>
To be all you demand of me.    <br/>
<br/>
If you cannot be this—a laundress and cook<br/>
You can hire, with little to pay;<br/>
