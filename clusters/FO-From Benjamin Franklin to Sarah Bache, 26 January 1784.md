Passy Jany: 26: 1784  
  
Your care in sending me the news-papers is very agreeable to me. I received by Captn. Barney those relating to the Cincinnati. My opinion of the institution cannot be of much importance. I only wonder that when the united wisdom of our nation had, in the Articles of Confederation, manifested their dislike of establishing ranks of nobility, by authority either of the Congress or of any particular state, a number of private persons should think proper to distinguish themselves and their posterity, from their fellow citizens, and form an order of hereditary Knights, in direct opposition to the solemnly declared sense of their country.  
  
I imagine it must be likewise contrary to the good sense of most of those drawn into it, by the persuasion of its projectors, who have been too much struck with the ribbands and crosses they have seen hanging, to the button holes of foreign officers. And I suppose those who disapprove of it have not hitherto given it much opposition, from a principle somewhat like that of your good mother, relating to punctilious persons who are always exacting little observances of respect, that “if People can be pleased with small matters, it is pity but they should have them”. In this view, perhaps I should not myself, if my advice had been asked, have objected to their wearing their ribband and badge themselves according to their fancy, though I certainly should to the entailing it as an honour on their posterity. For, honour worthily obtained, as that for example of our officers, is in its nature a personal thing, and incommunicable to any but those who had some share in obtaining it. Thus among the Chinese, the most antient, and from long experience the wisest of nations, honour does not descend, but ascends. If a man from his learning, his wisdom, or his valour, is promoted by the emperor to the rank of Mandarin, his parents are immediately entitled to all the same ceremonies of respect from the people, that are established as due to the Mandarin himself; on the supposition, that it must have been owing to the education, instruction and good example afforded him by his parents that he was rendered capable of serving the public. This ascending honour is therefore useful to the state, as it encourages parents to give their children a good and virtuous education. But the descending honour, to a posterity who could have no share in obtaining it, is not only groundless and absurd, but often hurtful to that posterity, since it is apt to make them proud, disdaining to be employed in useful arts, and thence falling into poverty, and all the meannesses, servility and wretchedness attending it; which is the present case with much of what is called the Noblesse in Europe. Or if, to keep up the dignity of the family, estates are entailed entire  
  
on the eldest male heir, another pest to industry and improvement of the country is introduced, which will be followed by all the odious mixture of pride, and beggary, and idleness that have half depopulated and decultivated Spain; occasioning continual extinction of families by the discouragements of marriage, and neglect in the improvement of estates. I wish therefore that the Cincinnati if they must go on with their project, would direct the badges of their order to be worn by their fathers and mothers, instead of handing them down to their children. It would

a good precident and might have good effects. It would also be a kind of obedience to the fourth commandment, in which God enjoins us to honour our father and mother, but has no where directed us to honour our children. And certainly no mode of honouring those immediate authors of our being can be more effectual, than that of doing praise worthy actions, which reflect honour on those who gave us our education; or more becoming than that of manifesting by some public expression or token, that it is to their instruction and example we ascribe the merit of those actions.  
But the absurdity of descending honours is not a mere matter of philosophical opinion, it is capable of mathematical demonstration. A man’s son, for instance, is but half of his family, the other half belonging to the family of his wife. His son too, marrying into another family, his share in the Grand son is but a fourth; in the great grandson by the same process it is but an eighth. In the next generation a sixteenth; the next a thirty second; the next a sixty fourth; the next an hundred and twenty eighth; the next a two hundred and fifty sixth; and the next a five hundred and twelfth. Thus in nine generations which will not require more than 300 years, (no very great antiquity for a family) our present Chevalier of the Order of Cincinnatus’s share in the then existing knight will be but a 512th part; which, allowing the present certain fidelity of American wives to be insured down through all those nine generations, is so small a consideration, that methinks no reasonable man would hazard, for the sake of it, the disagreeable consequences of the jealousy, envy, and ill will of his countrymen.  
Let us go back with our calculation from this young noble,  
  
the 512th. part of the present Knight, through his nine generations till we return to the year of the institution. He must have had a father and mother, they are two; each of them had a father and mother, they are four. Those of the next preceeding generation will be eight; the next sixteen, the next thirty two; the next sixty four; the next One hundred and twenty eight; the next two hundred and fifty six; and the ninth in this retrocession five hundred and twelve, who must be now existing and all contribute their proportion of this future Chevalier de Cincinnatus. These, with the rest, make together as follows.

One thousand and twenty two men and women contributors to the formation of one knight. And if we are to have a thousand of these future knights there must be now and hereafter existing one million and twenty two thousand fathers and mothers who are to contribute to their production, unless a part of the number are employed in making more knights than one. Let us strike off then the 22000 on the supposition of this double employ and then consider whether after a reasonable estimation of the number of rogues and fools, and Royalists and scoundrels, and  
  
prostitutes, that are mixed with and help to make up necessarily their million of predecessors, posterity will have much reason to boast of the noble blood of the then existing set of chevaliers of Cincinnatus. The future genealogists too of these Chevaliers in proving the lineal descent of their honour through so many generations, (even supposing honour capable in its nature of descending,) will only prove the small share of this honour which can be justly claimed by any one of them, since the above simple procession arithmetic makes it quite plain and clear, that in proportion as the antiquity of the family shall augment, the right to the honour of the ancestor will diminish; and a few generations more would reduce it to something so small as to be very near an absolute nullity. I hope therefore that the order will drop this part of their project, and content themselves as the Knights of the Garter, Bath, Thistle, St Louis, and other orders of Europe do, with a life enjoyment of their little badge and ribband, and let the distinction die with those who have merited it. This I imagine will give no offence. For my own part, I shall think it a convenience when I go into a company where there may be faces unknown to me, if I discover, by this badge, the persons who merit some particular expression of my respect; and it will save modest virtue the trouble of calling for our regard, by awkward round about intimations of having been heretofore employed as officers in the continental service.  
The gentleman who made the voyage to France to provide the ribbands and medals; has executed his commission. To me they seem tolerably done; but all such things are criticised. Some find fault with the Latin, as wanting classical elegance and correctness; and since our nine universities were not able to furnish better Latin, it was pity, they say, that the mottos had not been in English. Others object to the Title, as not properly  
  
assumable by any but General Washington, and a few others who served without pay. Others object to the bald eagle, as looking too much like a Dindon or turkey. For my own part I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly. You may have seen him perched on some dead tree, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the labour of the fishing hawk; and when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish, and is bearing it to his nest for the support of his mate and young ones, the bald eagle pursues him, and takes it from him. With all this injustice, he is never in good case, but like those among men who live by sharping and robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy. Besides he is a rank coward: the little king bird not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district. He is therefore by no means a proper emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America, who have driven all the king birds from our country, though exactly fit for that order of knights which the French call Chevaliers d’Industrie. I am on this account not displeased that the figure is not known as a bald eagle, but looks more like a turkey. For in truth, the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America. Eagles have been found in all countries, but the turkey was peculiar to ours, the first of the species seen in Europe being brought to France by the Jesuits from Canada, and served up at the wedding table of Charles the ninth. He is besides, (though a little vain and silly tis true, but not the worse emblem for that) a bird of courage, and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the British guards who should presume to invade his farm yard with a red coat on.  
I shall not enter into the criticisms made upon their Latin. The gallant officers of America may not have the merit of  
  
being great scholars, but they undoubtedly merit much as brave soldiers from their country, which should therefore not leave them merely to fame for their virtutis premium, which is one of their Latin mottos. Their esto perpetua, another, is an excellent wish, if they meant it for their country; bad, if intended for their order. The states should not only restore to them the omnia of their first motto,* which many of them have left and lost, but pay them justly, and reward them generously. They should not be suffered to remain with all their new created chivalry entirely in the situation of the gentleman in the story, which their omnia reliquit reminds me of. You know every thing makes me recollect some story. He had built a very fine house and thereby much impaired his fortune. He had a pride however in showing it to his acquaintance. One of them after viewing it all, remarked a motto over the door, ŌIA vanitas. What says he is the meaning of this ŌIA? ’tis a word I don’t understand. I will tell you said the gentleman: I had a mind to have the motto cut on a piece of smooth marble, but there was not room for it between the ornaments, to be put in characters large enough to be read. I therefore made use of a contraction antiently very common in Latin manuscripts whereby the m’s and n’s in words are omitted, and the omission noted by a little dash above, which you may see there, so that this word is OMNIA, Omnia vanitas. O. says his friend, I now comprehend the meaning of your motto, it relates to your edifice; and signifies, that if you have abridged your omnia you have nevertheless left your VANITAS legible at full length.

My dear Child,

ceived by Captain Barney those relating  
to the Concinnati, My opinion of the in-  
stitution cannot be of much importance ;

the trouble of calling for our regard, by  
awkward round-about intimations of  
having been heretofore employed as of-  
ficers in the continental service.  
  
The gentleman who made the voyage  
to France to provide the ribbands and  
medals has executed his commission.  
To me they seem tolerably done ; but  
all such things are criticised. Some find  
fault with the Latia, as wanting classical  
elegance and correctness ; and since our  
nine universities were not able to furnish  
better Latin, it was pity, they say, that  
the mottos had not been in English.  
Others object to the title, as not proper-  
ly assumable by any but General Wash-  
ington, and a few others, who served  
without pay. Others object to the bald  
eagle, as looking too much like a dindon,  
or turkey. For my own part, [ wish the  
bald eagle had not been chosen as the  
representative of our country ; he is a  
bird of bad moral character—he does  
not get his living honestly: you may  
have seen him perched on some dead  
tree, where, too lazy to fish for himself,  
he watches the labour of the fishing-  
hawk ; and when that diligent bird has  
at length taken a fish, and is bearing it  
to his nest for the support of his mate  
and young ones, the bald eagle pursues  
him, and takes it from him. With all  
this injustice he is never in good case,  
but,like those among men who live by  
sharping and robbing, he is generally  
poor, and often very lousy. Besides, he  
is a rank coward: the little king-bird  
not bigger than a sparrow, attacks him  
boldly,and drives him out of the district.  
He is therefore by no means a_ proper  
emblem for the brave and honest Cincin-  
nati of America, who have driven all the  
kang birds from our country : tho’ ex-  
actly fit for that order of knights which  
the French call Chevaliers d&#x27; Industrie.  
I am on this account not displeased that  
the figure is not known as a bald eagle,  
but looks more like a turkey. For, in  
truth,the turkey is,in comparison,a much  
more respectable bird, and withal a true  
original native of America. Eagles have  
been found in all countries, but the tur-  
key was peculiar to ours; the first of  
the species seen in Europe being brought  
to France by the Jesuits from Canada,  
and served up at the wedding-table of  
Ninth, He is besides  
  
i‘harlac the  
  
Original Letiers of Dr. Franklin.

but not the worse emblem for that) q |  
bird of courage, and wouid not hesitate  
  
to attack a grenadier of the British  
guards, who should presume to invade  
his farm-yard with a red coat on.  
  
J shall not enter into the criticisms  
made upon their Latin. The gallant  
officers of America may not have the  
merit of being great scholars, but they  
undoubtedly deserve much as brave soi.  
diers from their country, which should  
therefore not leave them merely to fume  
for their virtutis premium, which is one  
of their Latin mottos. Their esto per-  
peltua, another, is an excellent wish, jf  
they meant it for their country ; bad, if  
intended for their order. The state:  
should not only restore to them the  
omnia of their first motto,* which many  
of them have left and lost, but pay them  
justly and reward them generously.  
They should not be suffered to remain  
with all their new-created chivalry en-  
tirely in the situation of the gentleman  
in the story, which their omnia reliquit  
reminds me of. You know every thing  
makes me recollect some story. He had  
built a very fine house, and thereby  
much impaired his fortune. He had a  
pride however in shewing it to his ac-  
quaintance. One of them, after viewing  
it all, remarked a motte over the door,  
OfA VANITAS. What, says he, &#x27;s  
the meaning of this OLA ? ’tis a word J  
don’t understand, I will tell you, said  
the gentleman : I had a mind to have  
the motto cut on a piece of smooth mar-  
ble, but there was not room enough for  
it between the ornament, to be put 10  
characters large enough to be read. I  
therefore made use of a contraction an-  
ciently very common in Latin maot-  
scripts, whereby the m’s and ms In  
words are omitted, and the ompssio®  
noted by a little dash above, which you  
may see there, so that the word is omni  
—omnra vanitas. QO, said his friend, f

motto, it relates to your edifice ; and SIE&quot;

* [shall sot enter into the criticisms made upon their Latin. The gal-  
lant officers of America may not have the meritof being great scholars, but  
they undoubtedly merit much, as brave soldiers, from their country, which  
should, therefore, not leave them merely to fame for their virtutis pre-  
mium. which is one of their Latin mottos. Their esto perpetua. another,  
is an excellent wish, if they meant it for their country ; bad, if intended  
for their order. The States should not only restore to them the omnia*  
of their first motto, which many of them have left and lost, but pay them  
justly, and reward them generously. ‘They should uot be suffered to  
remain with all their new created chivalry entirely in the situation of the  
gentleman in the story, which their omnia reliquit reminds me of. You  
know every thing makes me recollect some story. He had built a very  
fine house. and thereby much impaired his fortune. He had a pride,  
however in showing it to his acquaintance. | One of them, after view-  
ing it all, remarked a motto over the door, o1a vaniras. ‘ What.’ says  
he, ‘ is the meaning of this oia, ’tis a word I don’t understand.’ ‘I  
will tell you,’ said the gentleman: ‘I had a mind to have the motto cut  
ona piece of smooth marble, but there was not room for it, between the  
ornaments, to be put in characters large enough to be read. J there-  
fore made use of a contraction anciently very common in Latin manu-  
scripts, whereby the m’s and n’s in words are omitted, and the omis-  
sion noted by alittle dash above, which you may see there, so that the word  
is omnia, OMNIA VANITAS.” ‘QO, said his friend, ‘ | now comprehend  
the meaning of your motto, it relates to your edifice : and signifies, that  
if you have abridged your omnia, you have nevertheless left your vaNiTas  
legible at full length.’ ”°—£&#x27;ranklin’s Works, vol. vi. p. 126.

Tue American Eaciur.—‘‘ For my own part,’’ said Dr. Franklin, ‘I  
wish the bald-eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our coun-  
try; he is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living hon-  
estly ; you may have seen him perched on a dead tree, where, too lazy to  
fish for himself, he watches the labors of the fishing-hawk ; and when that  
diligent bird has at length taken a fish, and is bearing it to his nest, for the  
support of his mate and young ones, the bald-eagle pursues him and takes it  
from him. With. all this injustice he is seldom in good condition, but, like  
those among men who live by sharping and robbery, he is generally poor  
and often lousy.’’—Letter to Mrs. Bache.

Eagle of America, and that it is the national emblem of the United States.  
Benjamin Franklin, in alluding to this circumstance, says, ‘‘ For my part,  
I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our  
country. He is a bird of bad moral character; he does not get his living  
honestly. You may have seen him perched on some dead tree, where, too  
lazy to fish for himself, he watches the labours of the fishing hawk; and  
when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish, and is bearing it to his

him, and takes it from him. With all this injustice, he is never in good ease,  
but, like those among men who live by sharping and robbing, he is generally  
poor, and very often lousy. Besides, he is a rank coward: the little king-  
bird, not bigger than a sparrow, attacks him boldly, and drives him ont of  
the district. He is, therefore, by no means a proper emblem for the brave  
and honest Cincinnati of America, who have driven all the King Birds from  
our country; though exactly fit for that order of knights which the French  
call Chevaliers d’ Industrig.””

his voyage to France to provide the  
ribands and medals had executed his  
commission :—  
  
To me (says that venerable philoso-  
pher and sturdy Republican) they seem  
tolerably done; but all such things are  
criticized. Some find fault with the  
Latin, as wanting classical elegance and  
correctness ; and since our nine univer-  
sities were not able to furnish better  
Latin, it was a pity, they say, that the  
mottos had not been in English. Others  
object to the title, as not properly as-  
sumable by any but General Washington  
and a few others who served without pay.  
Others object to the bald eagle, as look-  
ing like a dindon, or turkey.  
  
For my own part, I wish the bald  
eagle had not been chosen as the repre-  
sentative of our country: he is a bird of  
bad moral character; he does not get  
his living honestly. You may have seen  
him perched on some dead tree, where,  
too lazy to fish for himself, he watches  
the labour of the fishing-hawk ; and when  
that diligent bird has at length taken a

bald eagle pursues him and takes it from  
him. With all this injustice he is never  
in good case, but like those among men  
who live by sharping and robbing, he is  
generally poor, and often very lousy.  
Besides, he is a rank coward: the little

means a proper emblem for the brave  
and honest Cincinnati of America, who  
have driven all the Aing-birds from our  
country, though exactly fit for that order  
of knights which the French call Che-  
valiers d’ Industrie. 1 am, on this ac-  
count, not displeased that the figure is  
not known as a bald eagle, but looks  
more like a turkey. For, in truth, the  
turkey is, in comparison, a much more  
respectable bird, and withal a true ori-  
ginal native of America. Eagles have  
been found in all countries, but the  
turkey was peculiar to ours; the first of  
the species seen in Europe being brought  
to France by the Jesuits from Canada,  
and served up at the wedding-table of

“The absurdity of descending henors is not a

ble of mathematical Gemonstration. A man’s

other half belonging to the family of his wife.  
His son, too, marrying into another family, his

eighth; inthe second generation a sixteenth;  
the next a thirty-secend; the next a sixty-

than 300 years, (no very great antiquity for  
a family,) our present Chevalier of the Order ef  
Cincinnatus’ share in the then existing knight  
will be but a five hundred and twelfth par  
which, allowing the present certain fidelity o  
American wives to be insured down through all
