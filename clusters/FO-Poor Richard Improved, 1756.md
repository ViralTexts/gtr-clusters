Courteous Reader,  
I suppose my Almanack may be worth the Money thou hast paid for it, hadst thou no other Advantage from it, than to find the Day of the Month, the remarkable Days, the Changes of the Moon, the Sun and Moon’s Rising and Setting, and to foreknow the Tides and the Weather; these, with other Astronomical Curiosities, I have yearly and constantly prepared for thy Use and Entertainment, during now near two Revolutions of the Planet Jupiter. But I hope this is not all the advantage thou hast reaped; for with a View to the Improvement of thy Mind and thy Estate, I have constantly interspers’d in every little Vacancy, Moral Hints, Wise Sayings, and Maxims of Thrift, tending to impress the Benefits arising from Honesty, Sobriety, Industry and Frugality; which if thou hast duly observed, it is highly probable thou art wiser and richer many fold more than the Pence my Labours have cost thee. Howbeit, I shall not therefore raise my Price because thou art better able to pay; but being thankful for past Favours, shall endeavour to make my little Book more worthy thy Regard, by adding to those Recipes which were intended for the Cure of the Mind, some valuable Ones regarding the Health of the Body. They are recommended by the Skilful, and by successful Practice. I wish a Blessing may attend the Use of them, and to thee all Happiness, being Thy obliged Friend,   
R. Saunders

A Change of Fortune hurts a wise Man no more than a Change of the Moon.  
There is no Virtue, the Honour whereof gets a Man more Envy, than that of Justice, because it procures great Authority among the common People; they only revere the Valiant, and admire the Wise, while they truly love Just Men; for in these they have intire Trust and Confidence, but of the former, they always fear one, and mistrust the other. They look on Valour as a certain natural Ferment of the Mind, and Wisdom as the Effect of a fine Constitution, or a happy Education; but a Man has it in his own Power to be just; and that is the Reason it is so dishonourable to be otherwise; as Waller handsomely expresses it,  
  
Of all the Virtues, Justice is the best,  
Valour, without it, is a common Pest;  
Pirates and Thieves, too oft with Courage grac’d,

Censuring the Words and Sentiments of others in Conversation, is absolute Folly; for it answers none of the Ends of Conversation. He who uses it, neither improves others, is improved himself, or pleases any one. How amiably contrary is Pope’s Character of a Critic.  
  
——the Man who Counsel can bestow,  
Still pleas’d to teach, and yet not proud to know?  
Unbias’d, or by Favour, or by Spite;  
Not dully prepossess’d, or blindly right;  
Tho’ learn’d, well-bred; and tho’ well-bred, sincere;  
Modestly bold, and humanly severe:  
Who to a Friend his Faults can freely show,  
And gladly praise the Merit of a Foe;  
Blest with a Taste exact, yet unconfin’d,  
A Knowledge both of Books and human Kind;  
Gen’rous Converse, a Soul exempt from Pride,  
And Love to praise, and Reason on its Side.  
Such once were Critics, such the happy Few,  
Athens and Rome in better Ages knew.

ore Paper Bills could not be obtained. Friends and Countrymen, my Advice on this Head shall cost you nothing, and if you will not be angry with me for giving it, I promise you not to be offended if you do not take it.  
You spend yearly at least Two Hundred Thousand Pounds, ’tis said, in European, East-Indian, and West-Indian Commodities: Supposing one Half of this Expence to be in Things absolutely necessary, the other Half may be call’d Superfluities, or at best, Conveniences, which however you might live without for one little Year, and not suffer exceedingly. Now to save this Half, observe these few Directions.  
1. When you incline to have new-Cloaths, look first well over the old Ones, and see if you cannot shift with them another Year, either by Scouring, Mending, or even Patching if necessary. Remember a Patch on your Coat, and Money in your Pocket, is better and more creditable than a Writ on your Back, and no Money to take it off.  
2. When you incline to buy China Ware, Chinces, India Silks, or any other of their flimsey slight Manufactures; I would not be so hard with you, as to insist on your absolutely resolving against it; all I advise, is, to put it off (as you do your Repentance) till another Year; and this, in some Respects, may prevent an Occasion of Repentance.  
3. If you are now a Drinker of Punch, Wine or Tea, twice a Day; for the ensuing Year drink them but once a Day. If you now drink them but once a Day, do it but every other Day. If you do it now but once a Week, reduce the Practice to once a Fortnight. And if you do not exceed in Quantity as you lessen the Times, half your Expence in these Articles will be saved.  
4thly and lastly, When you incline to drink Rum, fill the Glass half with Water.  
Thus at the Year’s End, there will be An Hundred Thousand Pounds more Money in your Country.  
  
If Paper Money in ever so great a Quantity could be made, no Man could get any of it without giving something for it. But all he saves in this Way, will be his own for nothing, and his Country actually so much richer. Then the Merchants old and doubtful Debts may be honestly paid off, and Trading become surer thereafter, if not so extensive.

Simplicity, Innocence, Industry, Temperance, are Arts that lead to Tranquility, as much as Learning, Knowledge, Wisdom and Contemplation. A noble Simplicity in Discourse is a Talent rare, and above the Reach of ordinary Men. Genius, Fancy, Learning, Memory, &amp;c. are so far from helping, that they often hinder the Attaining of it.  
By the Word Simplicity, is not always meant Folly or Ignorance; but often, pure and upright Nature, free from Artifice, Craft or deceitful Ornament. In this Sense Pope uses it, in the Epitaph he made for his Friend Gay, too beautiful and instructive to be here omitted.  
  
Of Manners gentle, of Affections mild,  
In Wit a Man, Simplicity a Child.  
Words ever pleasing, yet sincerely true,  
Satire still just, and Humour ever new.

And uncorrupted, ev’n among the Great.

Well, my Friend, thou art now just entering the last Month of another Year. If thou art a Man of Business, and of prudent Care, belike thou wilt now settle thy Accompts, to satisfy thyself whether thou hast gain’d or lost in the Year past, and how much of either, the better to regulate thy future Industry or thy common Expences. This is commendable. But it is not all. Wilt thou not examine also thy moral Accompts, and see what Improvements thou hast made in the Conduct of Life, what Vice subdued, what Virtue acquired; how much better, and how much wiser, as well as how much richer thou art grown? What shall it profit a Man, if he gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Without some Care in this Matter, tho’ thou may’st come to count thy Thousands, thou wilt possibly still appear poor in the Eyes of the Discerning, even here, and be really so for ever hereafter.  
  
Of Man’s miraculous Mistakes, this bears  
The Palm, “That all Men are about to live,”  
For ever on the Brink of being born.  
How excellent that Life they mean to lead!  
All Promise is poor dilatory Man,  
And that thro’ every Stage. When young, indeed,  
In full Content, we, sometimes, nobly rest,  
Unanxious for ourselves; and only wish  
As duteous Sons, our Fathers were more wise.  
At Thirty Man suspects himself a Fool;  
Knows it at Forty, and reforms his Plan;  
At Fifty chides his infamous Delay,  
Pushes his prudent Purpose to Resolve;  
In all the Magnanimity of Thought  
Resolves; and re-resolves; then dies the same.

When the Paste is made, and kneaded so as to be a little soft, divide it in several Pieces, about the Bigness of an Egg each: Then spread them out with a Rolling-pin, so as to make the Paste very thin, and place the whole regularly upon a Table.  
Have ready upon the Fire a Sauce-pan, or little Pot, or an Earthen Pipkin, with one Gallon

of Water. When the Water grows hot, put in some Salt, and a Quarter of a Pound of Butter or Suet; and when it begins to boil fiercely, throw in your Paste, having first cut it in very small Bits; for the more thin and small they are, the more they will swell. And take Care to throw them into that Part of the Water where it boils the most fiercely.  
After this a small Fire will be sufficient for making this Soup boil softly for an Hour and a Quarter, or for an Hour and a Half; but it will be necessary to stir it with a Spoon from Time to Time to the very Bottom, in order to prevent its sticking to the Saucepan.  
If you find it grows too thick, put in some warm Water, and if it appears to be too thin, sprinkle into it a little Meal. This Soup is agreeable to the Taste, very filling and nourishing; and the Quantity above-mentioned will be sufficient for six Persons, one Half for Dinner, and the rest for Supper. But as what remains after Dinner will become thick when cold, it must for Supper be diluted with a little warm Water, and made warm again upon a small Fire; and Care must be taken not to let it stand long in the Sauce pan or Pot, lest it should acquire a brassy or iron Taste.  
Ten Pounds of Meal made into Paste, will produce 13 Pounds and a Quarter, which prepared as before-mentioned, will be abundantly sufficient for feeding 60 Persons for a whole Day. And for these ten Pounds of Meal, making above 13 Pounds of Paste, there must be ten gallons of Water, two Pounds and a Half of Butter or Suet, and three Quarters of a Pound of Salt.

Rice is known to be one of the best Sorts of Food we have. Some whole Provinces, and even Kingdoms are nourished by it; and in others, the People draw more of their Subsistance from it, than either from Wheat or Rye.  
There are several Ways of preparing it for Food, as with Water, with the Fat of Meat, or with Milk; but whatever Way you may chuse, you must begin with washing and cleaning it well three different Times in warm Water.  
In order to prepare, with Water alone, a sufficient Quantity of it for feeding 30 Persons for a whole Day, put five Pounds  
*Here the Author tells us he means a Pound of 8 Ounces, called by the French Poids de Marc.  
of Rice into a Sauce-pan, or Pot, with five Gallons of Water, and a proportional Quantity of Salt: Make it boil upon a small Fire for three Hours, stirring it from Time to Time to prevent its sticking to the Vessel, and as you find it thickens pour in by Degrees more warm Water, to the Amount of five Gallons more. These five Pounds will produce sixty Portions or Shares, neither too thick nor too thin, two of which will be sufficient Food for one Person, and consequently, the five Pounds will be sufficient Food for thirty.  
In order to prepare with Meal [sic], or the Fat of Meat, a sufficient Quantity of Rice for feeding 30 Persons for a whole Day, put forty Ounces of Meat into the first five Gallons of Water, and after you have made it boil and froth up, throw in your five Pounds of Rice, with the proper Quantity of Salt, after which proceed as before directed; or instead of Meat you may put 20 Ounces of Suet, and the Rice will be equally good.  
And in order to prepare with Milk a sufficient Quantity of Rice for feeding 30 Persons for a whole Day, you are to proceed as with Water alone, only leave out a Gallon and a Half of the Water, and make it up with the same Quantity of Milk, first boiled and flected separately by itself, and not to be put in until the last Quarter of an Hour of the Boiling.  
It is to be understood, that according to the Number of Persons you intend to feed, you are to augment or diminish in Proportion the Dose of Rice, Water, Meat, Suet, or Milk. And the Rice prepared with Water or Suet may be kept for two or three Days; but that with Milk is apt to turn sour the next Day.  
These Receipts were, in December 1754, communicated to the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris, by M. Recolin, upon occasion of a Project offered to the Court of France by M. Bouebe, who has invented a farinacious (or mealy) Powder, six Ounces of which diluted in a proper Quantity of boiling Water, is sufficient for supporting a Man for a Day; and it has by Experiment been found, that by this Means a Man may be supported in Health and Vigour for any Time; which Powder he proposes to sell at a Penny, or one Sous French per Ounce.  
M. Recolin observes, that in the Year 1747, when there was a Famine in the South of France, and the Port of Bourdeaux was blocked up by the English, so that they could get no Supply by Sea, the King’s Commissary for Guienne caused to be printed a great Number of these Receipts, and dispersed them gratis thro’ the whole Province, by which 3 or 400,000 People were instructed and enabled to support themselves for six Weeks, and that in that Year fewer Persons died in that Province than had died at a Medium of ten Years before.  
He further observes, that the Poor in many Countries live mostly on some sort of farinacious Powder diluted with boiling Water, and often with cold Water, particularly the Natives in America, who in their Huntings, or in the long Marches they sometimes make to meet and fight their Enemies, have nothing to subsist on but a little Meal made of Indian Corn; and that after having subsisted for many Weeks or Months solely on this Diet, they are not only healthful and vigorous, but the Wounds they receive in Battle are cured with surprizing Facility.  
From all which he concludes, that there

rolling-pin, fo as to make the pafte of  
each very thin, and place the whole regu-  
larly upon a table.  
  
Have ready upon the fire a fauce-pan, or  
little pot, or an earthen pipkin, with one  
gallon [ of water. When the water  
grows hot, put in fome falt, and a quar-  
ter of a pound of butter or fuet ; and  
when it begins to boil fiercely, throw in  
your having firft cut it in very  
fmall bits; forthe more thin and fmall  
they are, the more they will fwell. And  
take care to theow them into that part of  
the water where it boils the moft fiercely.

fticking to the fauce-pan.  
  
If you find it grows too thick put in  
fome warm water, and if it appears to  
be too thin, fprinkle into it a little meal.  
This foup is agreeable to the tafte, very  
filling and nourifhing.; and the quantity  
above-mentioned will be fufficient for fix

for fupper. But as what remains after  
dinner will become thick when cold, it

“ait to Atta cccid Neher of Perfons  
  
at a fmali Expence.  
  
Rice is known ta be one of the bef  
forts of food we have. Some whole  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
rovinces, and even ki » are nou-  
rithed by it; and in others, the people  
draw more of their f ce. from. it,  
  
  
  
than either from wheat or tye.  
  
There are feveral ways of preparing jit  
for food, as with water, with the fat of  
meat, or with milk ; but whatever way  
you may chufe, you muft begin with  
wafhing and cleaning it well three diffe-  
rent times in warm water... ..  
  
fn order to prepare, with water alone,  
a fufficient quantity of it for feeding. 30  
perfons for a whole day, put five pounds *  
of rice into a fauce-pan, or pot, with  
five gallons of water, and a proportional  
quantity of fait: Make it boil upon a  
  
  
  
  
  
3  
  
time to time to prevent its {ticking to the  
veffel; and as you find it thickens pour by  
degrees more warm»water, to the amount  
of five gallons more, Thefe five pounds;  
will produce fixty portions or fhares, nei-  
  
ther too thick nor too thin, two of which D  
  
will be fufficient food for one perfon, and  
confequently, the four pounds will be  
fufficient food for thirty.  
  
In order to prepare with meal, or the  
fat of meat, a fufficient quantity of rice  
for feeding 30 perfons for a whole day,  
put 40 ounces.of meat into the firft five  
  
Recript toprepare RICE.  
  
(mall fire for three hours, ftirring it from. -  
  
79  
  
Thefe receipts were aft December  
communicated to the Royal Academy of  
Surgery at Patis, by M. Recolin, upon  
oceafion of a projyed offered tothe court  
of France by M. Bowebe; who has in.  
Vented a farinaciovs powder, fix ounces  
of which-diluted in a proper quantity of  
  
a boiling water, is fufficient for fupporting  
  
a man for a day ; and it has by experi-  
ment been found, that by this means a  
man may be fupported in health and vi-  
gour for any time; which powder he  
propofes to fell at a penny, or one fous  
French per ounce.  
M, Recolin obferves, that in the year  
1747, when there ‘was a famine in the  
B south of France, andthe port of Bourdeaux  
* was blocked up by the Englith, fo that  
they could get no fupply by fea, the king’s  
commiffary for&quot;Guienne caufed to be  
printed a great number of thefe receipts,  
and difperfed them gratis thro’ the whole  
province, by which 3 of 400,000. people  
were inftruéted and enabled to fupport  
  
C themieives for fix weeks, and that in that  
  
yeat fewer $ died in that province  
than. had died at amedium of ten years  
before,  
  
He further obferves, that the poor in  
many countries livé moftly.on fome fort  
of farinacious powder diluted with boil-  
ing water, and often with cold water,  
particularly the natives in America, who,  
  
they fometimés make to meet and fight  
their enemies, have nothing to fubfift on  
but a little meal made of Indian corn ;  
and that after having fubfifted for many  
weeks or montis folely on this diet, they  
are not only healthful and vigorous, but  
the wounds tfiey receive in battle are  
  
galions of water, and after you have &amp; cured with a furprifing facility,  
From all which he concludes, that there  
  
made it boil and froth up, throw in your  
five pounds of rice, with the proper quan-  
} tity-of falt, after which proceed as before  
direéted ; or inftead of meat you may  
put 20 ounces of fuet, andthe rice will  
be equally good. tas  
And in order.to. prepare with milk a.  
fufficient quantity of rice for feeding 30:  
perfons for a whole day, you are to-pro-  
ceed as with. water,alone, only leave out’  
a gallon and an.half of the water, and:  
  
make it up with the fame. quantity of  
milk, firft boiled and fleGed feparately by’  
itfelf, and not to be put.in patil the lat’  
  
quarter of an hour of the boiling.  
It is to be underftood, that according:  
  
  
  
Proportion the dofe of rice, water, meat,  
  
fuet,..or milk, And. the rice prepared  
  
With water or fuet may be kept for two:

We raise no seulptur’d trophy to thy name,  
  
Brave youth! the fairest in the lists of fame.  
  
Proud of thy birth, we boast th’ auspicious year;

With humble grief inscribe one artless stone,  
  
And from thy matchless honour date our own.  
  
99.—The late Sir John Trollope caused his grave to be dug some  
years previous to his death, and at the head a stone was placed  
perpendicularly, with the following lines:  
  
I, Sir John Trollope,  
  
Made this ground roll up;  
  
When God shall call my soul up,  
  
My body shall fill the hole up.  
  
100.—On Mr. Gay. By Mr. Pope.  
Of manners gentle, of affections mild,  
In wit a man, simpiicity a child;  
With native humour temp’ring virtuous rage,  
Form’d to delight at once and lash the age;  
Above temptation in a low estate,  
And uncorrupted e’en among the great;  
A safe companion and an easy friend,  
Unblam’d through life, lamented in his end.  
These are thy honours! not that here thy bust  
Is mix’d with heroes, or with kings thy dust,  
But that the worthy and the good shall say,  
Striking their pensive bosoms, “ Here lies Gay.

with  
some men has been turning point of  
infinite issue to the world.   
Herbert Spencer never heard of  
Oscar Wilde, until the latter’s trip to  
America.   
“The parting gives me pain,” as the  
man said when he had a troublesome  
tooth extracted.   
Before marriage he thought she was  
a little dear, but after marriage he  
found she was very extravagant.   
Professor: “What Latin word mean­  
ing money shows the fact that former­  
ly cattle were used as a medium of  
barter?&#x27;’ Junior: “Bullion.”   
“She struck him with a fiendish  
smile,” says a sensational novelist.  
That’s better than striking him for two  
dollars.   
A wise man will desire no more than  
what he may get justly, use soberly,  
distribute cheerfully and live content­  
edly’ with.   
No use in holding elections if money  
is to de‘ermine the result.

‘* Courteous Reader :  
  
‘* | suppose that my Almanack may be worth the  
money that thou hast paid for it, hadst thou no  
other advantage from it than to find the day of  
the Month, the remarkable Days, the Changes of  
the Moon, the Sun and Moon’s Rising and Setting,  
and to foreknow the 7Zides and the Weather ;  
these with other Astronomical Curiosities I have  
yearly and constantly prepared for Thy Use and  
Entertainment during now near two revolutions  
of the Planet Jupiter. But I hope that this is not  
all the Advantage that thou hast reaped ; for with  
a view to the Improvement of thy Mind and thy  
Estate, I have constantly interspers’d in every lit-  
tle vacancy, Moral Hints, Wise Sayings, and  
Maxims of Thrift, tending to impress the benefits  
arising from Honesty, Sobriety, Industry and  
Frugality ; which if thou hast duly observed, it is  
  
  
  
284  
  
highly probable that thou art Wiser and Richer  
many fold more than the Pence my Labours have  
cost thee. Howbeit, I shall not therefore raise  
my Price because thou art better able to pay ; but  
being thankful for past Favours, I shall endeavour  
to make my little Book more Worthy thy regard  
by adding to those Recifes which were intended  
for the Cure of the Mind, some valuable ones re-  
garding the Health of the Body. They are rec-  
ommended by the Skillful and by successful Prac-  
tice. I wish a Blessing may attend the use of  
them, and to thee all Happiness, being
