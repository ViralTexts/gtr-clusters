*Eloquent Extract*.—&quot;Generation after generation,&quot; says an eloquent writer, &quot;have felt as we feel, and their fellows were as active in life as ours now. They passed away in a vapor, while nature wore the same aspect of beauty as when her Creator commanded her to be. And so likewise shall it be when we are gone. The heavens shall be as bright over our graves as they are now around our path; the world will have the same attraction for offspring yet unborn that she once had for ourselves, and that she has now for our children. Yet a little while and all this will have happened! The throbbing heart will be stilled and shall be at rest.—Our funeral will wind on its way, and the prayers will be said, and the grave clods will be thrown in, and our friends will all return, and we shall be left behind to darkness and the worm. And it may be for some short time that we shall be spoken of, but the things of life will creep in, and our names will soon be forgotten. Days will continue to move on, and laughter and song will be heard in the very chamber in which we died; and the eye that mourned for us will be dried and glisten again with joy; and even our children will cease to think of us, and will not remember to lisp our names. Then shall we have become in the touching language of the Psalmist, &quot;forgotten and clean out of mind.&quot;

Generation after generation have felt  
as we feel, and their fellows were  
meanwhile as active in life as ours  
are now ; and soon did they all pass  
away, while nature wore the same as-  
pect of beauty as when her Creator  
commanded her being. And so like-  
wise shall it be when we are gone.  
The heavens will be as bright over our  
grave as they arenow around our path;  
the ocean will exhibit its gigantic ter-  
rors as unceasingly as ever ; the world  
will have the same attraction for an  
offspring, yet unborn, that she had  
once for ourselves, and that she has  
now for our children ; and the village  
urchins will clamber and leap over our  
narrow resting-places with the same  
unthinking merriment as did we over  
“those of our sires.  
  
Yet a little while—a very few more  
days or weeks—and all this will have  
  
pened. The throbbing heart will  
be stilled, and we shall at rest:  
our funeral will wind on its way, and  
  
the prayers will be said, and the grave-  
clods will be thrown in, and our friends  
will all return, and we shall be left  
behind to rot, like a loathsome thing,  
under the wormy ground. And, it may  
be, that for some short time we shall be  
spoken of ; but the things of life will  
creep in, and the bare mention of our  
name will be soon a thing forbidden.  
And days will continue to move on ;  
and laughter and song will be heard in  
the very chamber that we died in ; and  
the eye that mourned for us will be  
dried, and will glisten again with joy ;  
and even our children will cease to  
think of us, and will not remember to  
lisp our name: and then we have be-  
come—to use the touching language  
of the Psatmist— “forgotten and  
clean out of mind.”

A Beautiful Extract .—&quot; Gen­  
eration after generation,&quot; says a fine  
writer, &quot; have felt as we feel now,  
and their lives were as active as our  
own. They passed away like a vapor  
while Nature wore the same aspect  
of beauty as when her Creator com­  
manded her to be. The heavens  
shall be as bright over our graves as  
they are now around our paths.  
The world will have the same at­  
tractions for our offspring yet un­  
born that she once had for ourselves,  
and that she now has for our chil­  
dren. Yet a little while and all will  
have happened. The throbbing heart  
will be stilled and we shall be at rest.  
Our funeral will wend its way, and  
the prayers will be said, and our  
friends will all return, and we shall  
be left behind in silence and darkness  
for the worm. And it may be for a  
short time we shall be spoken of, but  
the things of life will creep in and  
our names will soon be forgotten.  
Days will continue to move ou ; and  
laughter and son g will be heard in the  
room in which we died ; and the eye  
that mourned for us will be dried and  
glisten with joy ; and even our chil­  
dren will cease to think of us, and  
will not remember to lisp our names.  
Then shall we have become, in the  
touching language of the psalmist,  
&quot; forgotten, and go out of mind.

aspect of beauty as when the Creator com­  
manded her to be. And so shall it be  
when we are gone. The heavens will be  
as bright over our graves as they are now  
around our path; the world will have the  
same attraction for oflspring yet unborn  
that she had once for ourselves, and that  
she has now for our children
