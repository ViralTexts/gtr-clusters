*Eloquent Extract*.—&quot;Generation after generation,&quot; says an eloquent writer, &quot;have felt as we feel, and their fellows were as active in life as ours now. They passed away in a vapor, while nature wore the same aspect of beauty as when her Creator commanded her to be. And so likewise shall it be when we are gone. The heavens shall be as bright over our graves as they are now around our path; the world will have the same attraction for offspring yet unborn that she once had for ourselves, and that she has now for our children. Yet a little while and all this will have happened! The throbbing heart will be stilled and shall be at rest.—Our funeral will wind on its way, and the prayers will be said, and the grave clods will be thrown in, and our friends will all return, and we shall be left behind to darkness and the worm. And it may be for some short time that we shall be spoken of, but the things of life will creep in, and our names will soon be forgotten. Days will continue to move on, and laughter and song will be heard in the very chamber in which we died; and the eye that mourned for us will be dried and glisten again with joy; and even our children will cease to think of us, and will not remember to lisp our names. Then shall we have become in the touching language of the Psalmist, &quot;forgotten and clean out of mind.&quot;

Generation after generation have felt  
as we feel, and their fellows were  
meanwhile as active in life as ours  
are now ; and soon did they all pass  
away, while nature wore the same as-  
pect of beauty as when her Creator  
commanded her being. And so like-  
wise shall it be when we are gone.  
The heavens will be as bright over our  
grave as they arenow around our path;  
the ocean will exhibit its gigantic ter-  
rors as unceasingly as ever ; the world  
will have the same attraction for an  
offspring, yet unborn, that she had  
once for ourselves, and that she has  
now for our children ; and the village  
urchins will clamber and leap over our  
narrow resting-places with the same  
unthinking merriment as did we over  
“those of our sires.  
  
Yet a little while—a very few more  
days or weeks—and all this will have  
  
pened. The throbbing heart will  
be stilled, and we shall at rest:  
our funeral will wind on its way, and  
  
the prayers will be said, and the grave-  
clods will be thrown in, and our friends  
will all return, and we shall be left  
behind to rot, like a loathsome thing,  
under the wormy ground. And, it may  
be, that for some short time we shall be  
spoken of ; but the things of life will  
creep in, and the bare mention of our  
name will be soon a thing forbidden.  
And days will continue to move on ;  
and laughter and song will be heard in  
the very chamber that we died in ; and  
the eye that mourned for us will be  
dried, and will glisten again with joy ;  
and even our children will cease to  
think of us, and will not remember to  
lisp our name: and then we have be-  
come—to use the touching language  
of the Psatmist— “forgotten and  
clean out of mind.”

passed away as a vapor, and the earth still  
wears the same beautiful aspect that she did  
then : so shall it be when we are gone, like  
autumn ieaves; to enrich our mother earth.  
The sun, the moon, and the stars, will shine  
a brightly over our graves as they do now  
around our path ; the world will have the  
same attractions for generations yet unborn  
that it had once for others, and has now for  
ourselves. Yet a-little while, and all this  
will have happened; the throbbing- heart  
will be stilled, and we shall be at rest; our  
funeral will wind on its way; and the pray­

thrown in, our friends will all return, and  
we shall be left. In a fevv days, the sound  
of mirth and gladness will resound in the  
very chamber where we died; and soon we  
shall be remembered, even by our children,  
as things Jong since passed a way.  
Such are some of the solemn thoughts of  
Jeath, to which a few of our emblems  
direct our attention, which, without reve­  
lation, is dark and gloomy. But we  
are suddenly revived by the evergreen of

ht you to the very point, I wish  
you to understand : it is true, one newspa­  
per is of but trifling value, but let an editor  
get in the habit of giving his papers away to  
Tom, Dick, and Harry, whenever called on,  
who will be fool enough to pay for what oth­  
ers get gratis? besides, it is morally wrong  
to make paying subscribers pay for the pa­  
pers&#x27;thus wasted upon persons who refuse to  
contribute one cent to the sustainment ofthe  
public press. We therefore feel it our duly  
to inform you, neighbor Snobs, that we do  
not give papers away if our paper is not  
worth buying, it is not worth reading.

Our funeral will wind on its way, and the

eye that mourned for us will be dried and  
glisten again with joy ; and even our chil­

is greater than was expected, and the stock of the road  
is above par. The Fail River Road will be connected  
with this, in the course of a year, and their trains will  
come this way, instead of passing, as they now do, over  
the Taunton Branch and Providence Roads. One oh­
