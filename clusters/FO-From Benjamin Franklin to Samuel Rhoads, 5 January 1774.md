London, Jan. 5. 1774  
I received your Favours of Oct. 29 and 31, inclosing the Votes, for which I thank you.  
I am much obliged to the Assembly for the repeated Marks of their Confidence in me. The Great Officers of State having generally been in the Country, no public Business of consequence has for some time been transacted here. But the Parliament meets next Week, when all will return again to their Stations and the Duty of their Offices, and the Boards resume Business. I do not find that your Laws of last Winter have yet been presented, and the time is now near for carrying your Paper-money Act into Execution. At present I do not see any Difficulty likely to arise upon it, on the Part of the Board of Trade, unless one should be started on the Uncertainty, there being no mention of the Value or kind of the Money to be struck, whether Sterling or Proclamation, or any other. But it being an Act of Pennsylvania, I suppose it is to be understood that the Money will be of the Value of the present Currency of that Province. Virginia has lately had a Quantity of Copper-Halfpence struck at the Mint here for their Province. Inclos’d I send you a Specimen of them. They may serve to keep out the worthless counterfeit Trash of late so common. With great Esteem and Respect, I am ever, Dear Friend, Yours most affectionately  
B Franklin

Dear FRIEND,  
  
I received your Favours of Oct. 29 and 31, inclosing the  
Votes, for which I thank you.  
  
I am much obliged to the Assembly for the repeated  
Marks of their Confidence in me. The Great Officers of  
State having generally been in the Country, no public Busi-  
ness of consequence has for some time been transacted here.  
But the Parliament meets next Week, when all will return  
again to their Stations and the Duty of their Offices, and  
the Boards resume Business. I do not find that your Laws  
of last Winter have yet been presented, and the time is now  
near for carrying your Paper-money Act into Execution.  
At present I do not see any Difficulty likely to arise upon  
it, on the Part of the Board of Trade, unless one should be  
started on the Uncertainty, there being no mention of the  
Value or kind of the Money to be struck, whether Sterling  
or Proclamation, or any other. But it being an Act of  
Pennsylvania, I suppose it is to be understood that the  
Money will be of the Value of the present Currency of that  
Province. Virginia has lately had a Quantity of Copper-  
Halfpence struck at the Mint here for their Province. In-  
clos’d I send you a Specimen of them. They may serve to  
keep out the worthless counterfeit Trash of late so common.  
  
With great Esteem &amp; Respect, I am ever,  
  
Dear Friend  
Yours most affectionately  
B. FRANKLIN.
