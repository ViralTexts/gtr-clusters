Philad[elphi]a Sept. 20. 1785.  
  
I am just arrived from a Country, where the Reputation of General Washington runs very high, and where every body wishes to see him in Person, but being told that it is not likely he will ever favour them with a Visit, they hope at least for a Sight of his perfect Resemblance by means of their Principal Statuary Mr Houdon, whom Mr Jefferson and my self agreed with to come over for the purpose of taking a Bust, in order to make the intended Statue for the State of Virginia. He is here, but the Materials and Instruments he sent down the Seine from Paris, not being arrived at Havre when we sail’d, he was obliged to leave them, and is now busied in supplying himself here. As soon as that is done, he proposes to wait on you in Virginia, as he understands there is no Prospect of your coming hither, which would indeed make me very happy, as it would give me the Opportunity of congratulating with you personally on the final Success of your long &amp; painful Labours in the Service of our Country, which have laid us all under eternal Obligations.

“ Pattapecrnia, September 20, 1785.  
  
“Dear Sra,—I am just arrived from a country where the reputation of  
General Wasnuxeron runs very high, and where everybody. wishes to see  
him in person; but being told that it is not likely that he will ever favour  
them with a visit, they hope at least fora sight of his perfect resemblance  
by means of their principal statuary, M. Hovpvoy, whom Mr. Jkrrerson  
and myself agn with ;  
to come over for the pur-  
pose of taking a bust in  
order to make the in-  
tended statue for the  
State of Virginia. He is  
here, but the materials  
and instruments he sent  
down the Seine from Par-  
is not being arrived when  
we sailed, he was obliged  
to leave them, and is now  
busied in supplying him-  
self here. As soon as that  
is done he purposes to  
wait on you in Virginia,  
as he understands there  
is no prospect of your  
coming hither, which, in-  
deed, would make me  
very bappy, as it would  
give me the opportunity  
of congratulating with  
you personally on the  
final success of your long  
and painful jabours in  
the service of our coun-  
try, which have laid us  
all under eternal obliga-  
tions.
