**A Philosophical Darkey**  
  
An elderly darkey, with a very philosophical and retrospective cast of countenance, was squatting upon his bundle on the hurricane deck of one of the Western river steamers, toasting his shins against the chimney, and apparently plunged in a state of profound meditation. His dress and appearance indicated familiarity with camp life, and it being soon after the siege and capture of Fort Donelson, I was inclined to disturb his reveries, and on interrogation found that he had been with the Union forces at that place, when I questioned further. His philosophy was so much in the Falstaffian vein that I will give his views in his own words as near as my memory will serve me:  
  
Were you in the fight?  
  
I had a little taste of it, sa.  
  
Stood your ground, did you?    
  
No, sa, I runs.  
  
Run at the first fire, did you?  
  
Yes, sa, an&#x27; would hab run soonar had I know&#x27;d it was comin&#x27;.  
  
Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to your courage.	  
Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa—cookin&#x27;s my profession.	  
Well, but have you no regard for your reputation?	  
Reputation! nuffin to me de side ob life.&quot;	  
Do you consider your self worth more than other people&#x27;s?	  
It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.	  
  
Then you must value it very highly?	  
  
Yes, sa. I does; dan all dis world; more dan a million dollars, sa; for what would dat be wuth to a man wid be bref out of him? Self-preserbashun am de fust law wid me, sa.	  
But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?	  
Cause, sa, different men sets different value on derselves; my life is not in de market.	  
  
But if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you died for your country.	  
  
What satisfaction would dat be to me, when der power of feelin&#x27; was gone?	  
  
Then patriotism and honor are nothing to you?	  
Nuffin,&#x27; whatever, sa—I regard dem as among the varieties.	  
If our soldiers were like you, traitors might have broken up the Government without resistance.&quot;	  
  
Yes, sa; der would hab been no help for it. I wouldn&#x27;t put my life in de scales ginst any guberment dat ever existed, for no guberment could replace de loss to me. Spect, dough dat de guberment&#x27;s safe, if da all like me.	  
  
Do you think that any of your company would have missed you if you had been killed?	  
  
May be not, sa; a dead white man ain&#x27;t much to dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga; but I&#x27;d a missed myself, and dat was de pint wid me.	  
  
It is safe to say that the darkey corpse of that African will never darken the field of carnage.

&quot;But if you lost it, you would have the

phic Darkey.  
A correipotident of the Cincinuati Ga­  
zette , writing from the Cumberland river,  
gives the following humorous colloquy with  
a philosophic darkey:  
I noticed upon the hurrioaue deok to-day  
an elderly darkey with a very philosophical  
and retrospective cast of countenauce,  
squatted upon hit bundle, roasting his shins  
against the chimney, and apparently plung­  
ed into a state of profound meditation. ?  
Finding, upon inquiry, that he belonged to  
the 9th Illinois, one of the most gallant be­  
haved and heavy losing regimeuts at Fort  
Donaldson battle, and part of which was  
aboard, I began to interrogate hirti upon the  
subject. Hit philosophy was so much in  
the Falstaflian vein that I will give his views  
in his own words as near a? my memorv  
  
serves me :  
&quot;Were vou in the tight?&quot;  
&quot;We had a little taste of it, sa.&quot;  
&#x27;?Stood your ground, did you?&quot;  
&quot;No sa, 1 runs/&#x27;  
&quot;Ruu at the first tire did you?&#x27;  
&quot;Yes, and would hah run sooner, had I  
know&#x27;d it war comin. &#x27;  
&quot;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to  
your courage.&quot;  
&quot;Dat isn&#x27;t iu my hue, ? ? cookin&#x27;s my  
profession.&quot;  
&quot;Well, but have you uo regard for your  
reputation?&quot;  
&quot;Reputation&#x27;s imtiin to me by de side ob  
life.&quot;  
  
&quot;Do you cousider your life worth more;  
than other people&#x27;s/  
?&#x27;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.;&#x27;  
&quot;Then you must value jour lite highly.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, aa, I do^i? more than all dis wuld,  
more than a m, lion ob dollars, sa, for what  
would dat b v/urth to a man wid de bref  
out ob hin. &#x27; Self-preserbation am de fust

&quot;But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men? &#x27;  
&#x27;&#x27;Because different men set different  
valuer upon dar lives; mine is not in de

&#x27; But if you lost it, you would have the

out resistance.&quot;

I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day an el-  
derly darkey, with a very philosophical and ret-  
rospective cast of countenance, squatted upon  
his bundle, toasting his shins against the chimney,  
and apparently plunged into a state of profound  
meditation. Tinding, upon inquiry, that he be-  
longed to the 9th Illinois, one of the most gallantly  
behaved and heavy-losing regiments at the Fort  
Donelson battle, and a part of which was aboard,  
I began to interrogate him upon the subject. His  
philosophy was so much in the Falstaffian vein  
that I will give his views in his own words as  
near as my memory serves me:  
  
‘* Were you in the fight?’  
  
*¢ Had a little taste of it, sa.’’  
  
‘¢ Stood your ground, did you? ”’  
  
** No, sa; [ runs.”’  
  
‘* Run at the first fire, did you? ’’  
  
‘© Yes, and would hab run sooner, had I know’d  
it war comin’.’’  
  
‘*Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your  
courage. ’”  
  
‘** Dat isn’t my line, sa—cookin’s my profes-  
sion.”’  
  
‘* Well, but have you no regard to your repu-  
tation?’  
  
** Reputation’s nothin’ to me by the side ob  
life.’  
  
**Do you consider your life worth more than  
other people’s? ”’  
  
** It is worth more to me, sa.’’  
  
‘Then you must value your life highly.’  
  
*¢ Yes, sa, I does, more than all dis world,  
more than a million ob dollars, sa; for what dat  
would be wurth to a man wid the bref out on  
him? Self-preserbashum am de fust law wid me.’’  
  
‘* But why should you act upon a different rule  
from other men ?”’  
  
‘* Because different men set different values  
upon dar lives ; mine is not in the market.’’  
  
** But, if you lost it, you would have the satis-  
faction of knowing that you died for your coun-  
| try.”?  
  
** What satisfaction would dat be to me when  
de power of feelin’ was gone? ’’  
  
“Then patriotism and honor are nothing to  
you? ”’  
  
** Nuffin whatever, sa ; I regard dem as among  
de vanities.’’  
  
‘© Tf our soldiers were like you, traitors might  
have broken up the Government without resist-  
ance.’?  
  
‘* Yes, sa ; dar would have been no help for  
it ; wouldn’t put my life in the scale ’ginst any  
government that ever existed, for no government  
could replace de loss to me.”’  
  
**Do you think any of your company would  
have missed you if you had been killed ? ”’  
  
‘*May be not, sa; a dead white man aint  
much to dese sogers, let alone a dead niggar ; but  
I’d missed myself, and dat was the pint wid me.’’  
  
It is safe to say that the dusky corpse of that  
African will never darken the field of carnage.

I noticed upon the hurricane deck an elder­  
ly darkey with a very philosophical and ret­  
rospective cast of countenance, squatted upon  
his bundle toasting his shins against the chim­  
ney, and apparently plunged into a state |of  
profound meditation. Finding, upon inquiry  
that he belonged to the Ninth Illinois, one of  
the most gallantly behaved and heavy losing  
regiments at the Fort Donelson battle, and  
a part of which was aboard, I began to inter­  
rogate him upon the subject. His philosophy  
was so much in the Falstaffian style that I

I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day an elder-  
ly darkey with a very philosophical and retrospective  
cast of countenance, squatted upon his bundle toast-  
ing his shins against the chimney, and apparently  
plunged in a state of deep meditation. Finding upon

the most gallantly behaved and heavily losing regi-

was aboard, I began to interrogate him upon the sub-  
ject. His philosophy was so much in the Falstaflian  
vein that I will give his views in his own words, as

“ Were you in the fight ?”  
  
“ TIad a little taste of it, sa.”  
  
“ Stood your ground, did you?”  
  
* No, sa, I runs.”  
  
“ Run at the first fire, did you ?”  
  
“ Yes,—sa, and I would had run soona, had I knoad  
it war coming.”  
  
« Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your cour-  
age.”  
  
“ Dat isn’t in my line, sa—cookin’s my profeshun.”  
  
“ Well, but have you no- regard for your reputa-  
tion.”  
  
“« Reputation’s nofin by the side of life.”  
  
“ Do you consider your life worth more than other  
people’s ?”  
  
“It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
  
“Then you must value it vety highly ?”  
  
“ Yes, sa, I does—more dan all dis world—more  
dan a million ob dollars, sa, for what would that be  
wuth to a man with the bref out of him? Self-pres-  
erbashun am de fust law wid me.”  
  
“ But why should you act upon a different rule  
from other men ?”  
  
* Because different men set different values upon  
dar lives—mine is not in the market.”  
  
“ Rut if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction  
of knowing that you died for your country.”  
  
“ What satisfaction would dat be to me when de  
power of feelin’ was gone ?”  
  
“The patriotism and honor are nothing to you? ”  
  
“ Nuflia whatever, sa—I regard demas among de  
vanities.”  
  
“ If our soldiers were like you, traitors might have  
broken up the government without resistance.”  
  
“ Yes sa, dar would have been no help for it. I  
wouldn’t put my life in de scale ‘ginst no gobernment  
dat eber existed, for no gobernment could replace  
de loss to me.”  
  
“ Do you think any of your company would have

“ May be not, sa—a dead white man ain&#x27;t much to

ore charac-  
teristic of the elderly Southern “darkey” than of young Africa  
of our Northern cities, which is to-day enlisting by thousands  
in the army.  
  
“Upon the hurricane-deck of one of our gunboats, an elderly darkey, with a very  
philosophical and retrospective cast of countenance, squatted upon his bundle,  
toasting his shins against the chimney, and apparently plunged into a state of pro-  
found meditation. Finding, upon inquiry, that he belonged to the 9th Dlinois, one  
of the most gallantly behaved and heavy-losing regiments at the Fort Donelson  
battle, and part of which was aboard, began to interrogate him upon the subject:  
  
“¢ Were you in the fight ?’  
  
“&lt;&lt; Had a little taste of it, sa’.’  
  
“¢Stood your ground, did you?’  
  
“6 No, sa’, I runs.’  
  
“¢Run at the first fire, did you?’  
  
¢&#x27;Yes, sa’, and would hab run soona, had I knowd it war comin’.’  
  
“Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your courage.’  
  
“* Dat isn’t my line, sa’—cookin’s my profeshun.’  
  
“¢Well, but have you no regard for your reputation ?’  
  
‘“** Reputation’s nuffin to me by de side ob life.”  
  
“¢Do you consider your life worth more than other people’s ?’  
  
“¢Tt’s worth more to me, sa’.’  
  
“¢Then you must value it very highly ?’  
  
‘“¢ Yes, sa’, I does, more dan all dis wuld, more dan a million of dollars, sa’, for  
what would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref out ob him? Self-preservation am  
de fust law wid me.’  
  
‘“*¢ But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?’  
  
““¢Becase different men sot differen values upon their lives: mine is not in de  
market.’  
  
«But if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you died  
for your country.’

state of profound meditation. His  
appearance and dress indicated fa­  
miliarit&#x27; with camp life, and it be  
ing soon after the seige and capture  
of Fort Donelson,T was inclined to  
disturb his reveries, and on interro­  
gation, found he had been with the  
Union forces at that place, when -1  
questioned him .further. His phil­  
osophy was so much in the Fal­  
staflian vein, that I will give  
his views fn his own words, aa near  
as my memory will serve mel  
&quot;Were you in the fight ?&quot; :  
&quot;Had a little taste of it, sa.&quot; .  
&quot;Stood your ground, did you ?&quot;  
. &quot;No sa, I runs.&quot;  
&quot;Run at the first fire, did you ?&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sa, an&#x27; would hab run soona  
hab I know&#x27;d it was coming.&quot;  
&quot;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very credita­  
ble to your courage.&quot; . . .  
. &quot;Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa, cook

&quot;Well, but have you no regard

&quot;Do you consider your life worth  
more than other people&#x27;s?&quot;  
&quot;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.&quot;  
&quot;Then you must value it very  
highly.&quot; -  
&quot;Yes, sa, I does more dan all

wuth to a man wid de bref out ob

&quot;But why should you act upon a  
different rule from other men.r  
&quot;Cause, sa, different men sets dif  
ferent value upon darselves. My  
life is not in de market.&quot;  
&#x27;.&#x27;But if you loGt it, yon would  
have the satisfaction of knowing;  
that you died for j&#x27;our country.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sa, dar would hab been no

Purpose and Equal Rights to all  
A Philosophical Darkey.  
An elderly darkey, with a very philoso­  
phical and restrospective cast ot counten­  
ance, was squatting upon his bundle on  
tbe hurricane deck of one of the Western  
river steamers, toasting his shins against  
the chimney, and apparently plunged iu a  
state of profound meditation. His dress  
and appearance indicated familiarity with  
camp life, and it being soon after the siege  
and capture of Fort Donelson, I was in­  
clined to disturb his reveries, and on in­  
terrogation found that he had been with  
the Union forces at that Tlace, when I  
questioned him further. His philosophy  
was so much in the Fal.taflian vein that I  
will give his views in his own words as  
tear as my memory will serve me.. , &#x27;

A Darker 7* View cl War*  
An elderly darkey, with a very philoso­  
phical and retrospective cast of countenance,  
was squatting nponbia bundle ou the hurri­  
cane deck of one of the Western river steam­  
ers, toasting his shins against the chimney,  
and apparently plunged in a state of pro­  
found meditation. His dress and appearance  
indicated familiarity with camp life, and it  
beingsoon after the siege and capture of  
FortDonelson, I was inclined to disturb his  
reveries, and on interrogation found that he  
had been with the Union forces at that  
place, when I questioned him further. His  
philosophy was so much in the Falstaffiian  
vein that I will give Ms views in his own  
words as near as my memory serves me,  
“Wore yon in the fight?”  
“ I had a little taste of it, sah.77  
“ Stood yonr ground, did yon ?”  
&quot;Ho. sah, I runs.”  
“Ron at the first fire, did you?”  
&quot;Yes, sah, and would have run soonah had  
I know7d it was comm7.”  
&quot;Why, that wasn7t vary creditable to  
your courage?”  
&quot; Hat isn&#x27;t in my line, sah—cookm’s my  
profession.77  
&quot;Weil, hut have yon no regard for your  
reputation f ”  
•Reputation! Nnffin to me by de side of  
life!”  
“Do yon consider your life worth more  
than other people’s T”  
&quot;It’s wnth more to me, sah.’7  
“Then you must value it very highly.77  
“ Yes, sah, I does: more dan all dis world;  
more dan a million of dollahs, sah; for what  
wonlddatbe wnth to aman wid de href out  
othirn? Self preservation am the fust law  
wid me, sah.77  
“ But why should you act on a different  
rule from other men f77  
“ Cause, sah, different men sets different  
value upon dereselves; my life is not in de  
market.77  
  
&quot; Bnt if yon lost it yon would have the sat­  
isfaction of knowing that yon died for yonr  
country.77  
&quot;What satisfaction would dat be to m  
when de power of feelin7 was gone ?&#x27;7  
“ Then patriotism and honor are nothing  
to yon ?”  
“Nnffin whatever, sah,—l regard deni as  
among the varieties.”  
“If onr soldiers were like yon, traitors  
might have broken up the government with­  
out resistance.77  
&quot;Yes, sab, der would hab been no help for  
it I wouldn’t put my life in the scales  
against any gaherment dat eber existed, for  
no cnberment oonid replace the loss to me.  
’Spec*-, dough, dat de gubsrment safe if da  
all like me.”  
“Do you think any of your company  
would have missed you if you had been  
kilhd?” ;  
*• May be not, sab. A dead white man ain’t  
much to dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga;  
but I’d missed myself, and dat was de pint  
wid me.”  
It is safe to say that the corpse of that  
African will never darken the field of earn­  
age*

lhat he had been with the Union forces  
at that place, when I questioned him  
further. His philosophy was so much  
in the Falstaffin vein that I will give his  
views in his own words, as near as mem­  
ory will serve me :  
Were you in the fight? I asked.  
I had a little taste of it, sa.  
Stood your ground, did you ?  
No sah, I runs.&quot;  
Kun at the first fire, did you?  
Yes, sa, an&#x27; would hab run soona had  
I know&#x27;d it was coming.  
Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to  
your courage.  
Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa, cookin&#x27;s my  
profession.  
Well, have you no regard for your  
reputation.  
Reputation&#x27;s nuffin to me by de side ob  
life.  
Do you consider your life worth more  
than other people&#x27;s ?  
It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.  
Then you must value it very highly.  
Yes, sa, I does, more den all dis world ;  
more den a million dollers, sa ; for what  
would dat be wuth wid de bref out of  
him ? Self preserbation am de fust law  
wid me, sa.  
But why should you acton a different  
rule from other men ?  
Cause, sa, different men set different  
value on der selves ? My life is not in  
the market.  
Cut if you lost it you would have the  
satisfaction of knowing &#x27;that you did it  
for your country.  
What satisfaction would dat be to me,  
when de power ob feeling am gone ?  
Then patriotism and honor are noth­  
; to you ?  
Nuffin, whateber, sa I regard dem as  
among the varieties, sa.  
If our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken np the government  
without resistance.  
Yes, sa ; dar would hab been no help  
for it. I wouldn&#x27;t put my life in the  
scales ginst any guberment dat eber ex­  
isted, for no guberment could replace de  
loss to me. Spect, dough, dat de gub­  
erment safe, if da all like me.&quot;  
Do you think any of your company  
would have missed you if you had been  
killed?  
May be not, sa. A dead white man  
ain&#x27;t much to dese sogers, let alone a  
dead nigga ; but I&#x27;d a missed myself  
and dat was de pint wid me.  
It is safe to say that the dark corpse

A PHILOSOPHICAL DARKET.  
An elderly darkey, with a very phil­  
1 osophical and -retrospective cast of  
countenance, was ?qu*Mn?g upon his  
I bundle on the hurricane deck of the |  
steamer, toasting his shins against the

state of profouud meditation. His dress  
j and appearance indicated familiarity,  
with camp life, and it being scon after  
the siege and capture of Fort Donald­  
son, I was inclined to disturb his rever­  
ies, and on interrogation fouud that he  
had been with the Union forces at that

I noticed upon the hurricane deck an el-  
derly darkey, with a very philosophical and  
retrospective cast of countenance, squatted  
upon his bundle, toasting his shins against  
the chimney, and plunged into a state of  
profound meditation. Finding, upon inqui-  
ry, that he belonged to the 9th Illinois, one  
of the most gallantly behaved and heavy  
losing regiments at Fort Donelson battle,  
and a part of which was aboard, I began to  
interrogate him upon the subject. His phil-  
osophy was so much in the Falstaffian style  
that I will give his views in his own words,  
as near as my memory serves me:  
‘*Were you in the fight?”  
‘**Had a little taste of it, sa.”  
“Stood your ground, did you!  
‘*No, sa, I runs.”  
‘Run at first fire, did you?”  
*“*Yes, and would have run sooner, had I  
knowed it war comin’.”  
‘*Why that wasn’t very creditable to your  
courage.”  
*“*Dat isn’t in my line, sa—cookin’s my  
perfession.”  
“But have you no regard for your repu-  
tation?”  
  
‘‘Reputation’s nuffin to me by de side ob  
life.”  
  
“Do you consider your life worth more  
than other people’s?” °  
“It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
“Then you must value your life very  
highly?”  
**Yas, sa, I does; more dan all dis world;  
more dan a million ob dollars, sa; for what  
would dat be worth toa man wid de bref  
out of him? Self-preserbation am de fust  
law wid me.”  
**But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men?”  
“Because different men set different val-  
ues upon their lives; mine is not in de mark-  
et.”

A PHILOSOPHICAL DARKEY.  
  
An elderly darkey, with a very philoso­  
phical and retrospective cast of counte­  
nance, was squatting upon hit bundle on  
the hurricane deck of one of the western  
steamers, toasting his shins against the

appearance indicated familiarity with camp

capture of Fon Donelsorj, I was inclined  
to disturb his reveries. On interrogation  
I found that ha had been with the Union  
forces at that place, when I questioned him  
further. His philosophy was so much in  
the Falstaffian vein that I will give his  
views in his own words, as near as memory

An elderly colored man, with a very  
philosophical and retrospective cast  
of countenance, was squatting with  
his bundle upon the hurricane deck of

profound meditation. His dress and

with camp life, and, it being soon after  
the siege arid capture of Port Donel­

An elderly colored man. with a very philo­  
sophical and retrospective cast of con:*nance,  
was squatting with his bundle upon the hurri  
cane deck of one of the western river steamers,  
casting his sains against the chimney and  
apparently plunged In a state of profound medi­  
tation, says Eli Perkins’ &quot;Wit and Humor of  
the Age. ’ His dress and appearance indicated

after th * selge and capture of Fort Donaldson. I  
was inclined to disturb his reveries, and on inter­

forces at that place, when I questioned farther  
His philosophy was so peouliar that I will civ*

“Were you in the fight?&quot;  
&quot;I bad a little taste of it, sah.”  
“BtooAyour ground, did you?&quot;  
“No. sah. I runs,”  
“Run at the first fire, did you?&quot;  
“Yes. sah. an’ would have run soonah had I

“Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your  
courage.&quot;  
“Dat isn’t in my line, sah, coo tin’s my pro

“Well, but have you no regard for your repu­

“Reputation&#x27;s nuffln to me by the aide of  
“Do you consider your life worth more than  
other people’s?”  
&quot;It’s worth more to me, sah.&quot;  
&quot;But wny should you act upon a different role  
than other men?”  
&quot; ’Cause, sah, difl’rent men setsdifl’rent value  
on derselves; my life’s not in de market.”  
“But If you lost it you would have the satis­  
faction of knowing that you died for your  
country.&quot;  
’ ’What satisfaction would dat be to me when  
de Dower of feelin&#x27; was gone?&quot;  
’Then patriotism and honor are nothing to  
you?&quot;  
&quot;Nuffln whatever, sah.”  
“If our soldiers were all like you, traitors  
might have broken up the government without  
resistance.”  
&quot;Yes, sah; der would have been no help for it  
I wouldn&#x27;t put my life in &lt;le scales &#x27;gainst any

could replace de loss to mo. ’Spect though dat  
de guberment&#x27;s safe If de&#x27;re all like me. ’’  
“Do you think that any of your company

“Maybe not, sah; a dead white man ain&#x27;t

ry of tho War.  
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Ga­  
zette, writing from the Cumberland river,  
gives the following humorous colloquy  
with a philosophic darkey;  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to day  
an elderly darkey, with a very philosoph­  
ical and retrospective cast of countenance,  
squatted upon his bundle, toasting bis  
shins against the chimney and apparently  
plunged into a state of profound médita  
tion. Finding upon inquiry, that he be­  
longed to the 9th Illinois, one of the most  
gallantly behaved and heavy-losing regi­  
ments at the Fort Donelson battle and a  
part of which was aboard, I began to in­  
teirogate him upon the subject. His  
philosophy was so much in the Falstaffian  
vein that I will give his views in his own  
words as near as my memory serves me :  
&quot;Were you in the fight?&quot;  
&quot;Had a little taste of it sa.  
&quot;Stood yonr grounds, did you?&quot;  
&quot;No sa, I runs.&quot;  
&quot;Run at the first fire, did yon?&quot;  
&quot;Yes, and would have run sooner, had  
I know&#x27;d it war coinin&#x27;.&quot;  
&quot;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to  
yonr courage.  
Dat isn&#x27;t my line, sa— ccok&#x27;n&#x27;s my  
perfession.&quot;  
&quot;Well, but bave yon no regard for your  
reputation?  
&quot;Reputation&#x27;s nothin&#x27; to me by the side  
ob life. .  
&quot;Do yon consider yonr life worth more  
than other people&#x27;s?&quot;  
&quot;It is worth more to me, sa.  
&quot;Then you must value your life highly.&#x27;  
&quot;Yes, sa, I does, more than all dis  
world, more than a million ob dollars, sa,  
for what would dat be wurth to a man wid  
de bref out on blm. Self-preserbaslinm  
am de fust law wid me.&quot;  
&quot;But why should you act upon a dif­  
ferent rule from other men?&quot;  
Because different men set different val­  
ues upon der lives; mine is not in the  
market.&quot;  
But if yon lost it, yon would have the  
satisfaction of knowing that you died for  
yonr country.&quot;  
What satisfaction would dat be to me  
when de power ob feelia&#x27; was gone?&quot;  
&quot;Then patriotism and honor are noth­  
ing to yon?&quot;  
&quot;Nuffin whateva, sa; I regard dem as  
among de vanities,  
&quot;If our soldiers were likfi yon, traitors  
might have broken np the government  
without resistance.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sa; dar would have been no help  
for it; wouldn&#x27;t put mj life in the scale  
&#x27;gaiast any govevnment that ever existed,  
for ao government could replace de loss  
to me.  
&quot;Do yon think any of yonreomnany  
would bave missed yon if you had been  
killed?&#x27;.&#x27;  
&quot;Xey benot, sa; a dead white man ain&#x27;t  
much to deae sogers, let lone a dead nig­  
ga;but rd missed inyself, and dat was  
the pint wid me.  
It is safe to say that the dnsky corpse  
of that Africa* will sever darken the deld  
of carnage.

## [From _Current Literature (1888-1912)_](https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/sim_current-opinion_1898-10_24_4?page=81)

our gunboats an elderly darkey, with a very philo-  
sophical and retrospective cast of countenance,  
squatted upon his bundle, toasting his shins against  
the chimney, and apparently plunged into a state  
of profound meditation. Finding upon inquiry that  
he belonged to the Ninth Illinois, one of the most  
gallantly behaved and heavy losing regiments at  
the Fort Donelson battle, and part of which was  
aboard, I began to interregate him upon the sub-  
ject: “Were you in the fight?” I asked. ‘Had a  
little taste of it, sah.” “Stood your ground, did  
you?” “No, sah, I runs.” “Run at the first fire,  
did you?” “Yes, sah; and would hab run soonah,  
had I known it war comin’.” ‘Why, that wasn’t  
very creditable to your courage.” “Dat isn’t my  
line, sah—cookin’s my profession.” “Well, but  
have you no regard for your reputation?” ‘‘Repu-  
tation’s nuffin to me by de side ob life.” “Do  
you consider your life worth more than other peo-  
ple’s?” “It’s worth more to me, sah.” “Then you  
must value it very highly?” “Yes, sah, I does;  
more dan all dis wold, more dan a millicn ob dol-  
lars, sah, for what would dat be wuth to a man wif  
de bref out ob him? Self-preserbation am de fust  
law wid me.” “But why should you act upon a dif-  
ferent rule from other men?” “Because different  
men set different values upon their lives; mine is  
not in de market.” “But if you lost it, you would  
have the satisfaction of knowing that you died for  
your country.” “What satisfaction is dat to me,  
when de power ob feeling is gone?” “Then patriot-  
ism and honor are nothing to you?” “Nuffin, sah  
—I regard them as among the vanities.” “If our  
soldiers were like you traitors might have broken  
up the government without resistance.” ‘Yes,  
sah, dar would hab been no help for it. I wouldn’t  
put my life in the scale ’gainst any gobernment dat  
eber existed, for no gobernment could replace the  
loss to me.” “Do you think any of your company  
would have missed you if you had been killed?”  
‘Mabe not, sah—a dead white man ain’t much to  
dese sogers, let alone a nigga; but I’d a missed  
myself, and dat was de pint wid me.”
