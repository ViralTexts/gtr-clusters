**A Philosophical Darkey**  
  
An elderly darkey, with a very philosophical and retrospective cast of countenance, was squatting upon his bundle on the hurricane deck of one of the Western river steamers, toasting his shins against the chimney, and apparently plunged in a state of profound meditation. His dress and appearance indicated familiarity with camp life, and it being soon after the siege and capture of Fort Donelson, I was inclined to disturb his reveries, and on interrogation found that he had been with the Union forces at that place, when I questioned further. His philosophy was so much in the Falstaffian vein that I will give his views in his own words as near as my memory will serve me:  
  
Were you in the fight?  
  
I had a little taste of it, sa.  
  
Stood your ground, did you?    
  
No, sa, I runs.  
  
Run at the first fire, did you?  
  
Yes, sa, an&#x27; would hab run soonar had I know&#x27;d it was comin&#x27;.  
  
Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to your courage.	  
Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa—cookin&#x27;s my profession.	  
Well, but have you no regard for your reputation?	  
Reputation! nuffin to me de side ob life.&quot;	  
Do you consider your self worth more than other people&#x27;s?	  
It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.	  
  
Then you must value it very highly?	  
  
Yes, sa. I does; dan all dis world; more dan a million dollars, sa; for what would dat be wuth to a man wid be bref out of him? Self-preserbashun am de fust law wid me, sa.	  
But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?	  
Cause, sa, different men sets different value on derselves; my life is not in de market.	  
  
But if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you died for your country.	  
  
What satisfaction would dat be to me, when der power of feelin&#x27; was gone?	  
  
Then patriotism and honor are nothing to you?	  
Nuffin,&#x27; whatever, sa—I regard dem as among the varieties.	  
If our soldiers were like you, traitors might have broken up the Government without resistance.&quot;	  
  
Yes, sa; der would hab been no help for it. I wouldn&#x27;t put my life in de scales ginst any guberment dat ever existed, for no guberment could replace de loss to me. Spect, dough dat de guberment&#x27;s safe, if da all like me.	  
  
Do you think that any of your company would have missed you if you had been killed?	  
  
May be not, sa; a dead white man ain&#x27;t much to dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga; but I&#x27;d a missed myself, and dat was de pint wid me.	  
  
It is safe to say that the darkey corpse of that African will never darken the field of carnage.

was aboard, I began to interrogate him upon the subject. His

A COLORED FALSTATF.  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to­  
day an elderly darkey with a very philo­  
sophical and retrospective cast of counte  
  
nance, squatted upon his bundle, and  
toasting his shins against the chimney,  
and apparently plunged into a state of

quiry, that he belonged to the Ninth Illi­  
nois, one of the most gallantly behaved  
and heavily loosing regiments of the Fort  
Donelson battle, and part of which was  
aboard. I began to interrogate him upon  
the subiVct. His philosophy was so much  
the vei,1 that I will give his  
una III ins unu nuius, uvai a um

&quot; Were you in the fight ? &quot;

&quot; No, sa, I runs.&#x27;&#x27;  
&quot; Run at the first fire, did you ? &quot;  
&quot; Yes, sa, and would hab run soona,  
had I knowed it War comin.&quot;

&quot; Dat, isn&#x27;t ill my line, sa -cookin&#x27;s my

&quot; W 11, but have you no regard for your

Imputation s nuthn to me by ce side

&quot; Do you consider your life worth more  
than other people&#x27;s ? &quot;  
&#x27; K&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.&quot;  
&quot; Then you must value it very highly.&quot;  
&quot; Yes, sa, I does more dan all dis  
wuld more dan a million ob dollars, sa,  
for what would dat be wuth to a man wid  
de bref out ob him ? Sell&#x27;-preseibaiion  
iim de lust law wid me.&quot;  
&quot; But why should you act upon a dif­  
fer? 1 1 1 rule from other men ? &quot;  
&quot; Because different men sets different  
values on dar lives mine ain&#x27;t in de roar  
ker.&quot;  
&quot; But if you should lose it you would  
have the satisfaction of knowing that you  
died for your country.&quot;  
&#x27; What satisfaction Would dill be to me,  
when the power ob fcelin was gone  
&quot; Then patriotism and honor are noth-J  
mg to you ?  
&quot; Nothing whatever, sa I regard dem

&quot; If our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government  
without resistance.&quot;  
&quot; Yes, sa, dar would hab been no help for  
it. I wouldn&#x27;t put nivlife in de scale Vinst

A Philosophic Darkey. — A corre­  
spondent of the Cincinnati Gazette, writing  
from the Cumberland river, gives the follow­  
ing humorous account of a colloquy with a  
philosophic darkey :  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day an  
elderly darkey, wfth a very philosophical and  
retrospective cast of countenance, squatted  
upon his bundle, toasting his shins against the  
chimney, and apparently plunged into a state  
of profound meditation. Finding upon in­  
quiry that he belonged to the Ninth Illinois,  
one of the most gallantly behaved and heavy  
losing regiments at the Fort Donelson battle,  
and part of which was aboard, I began to in­  
terrogate him upon the subject. His philos­  
ophy was so much in the Falstaffian vein that  
I will give his views in his own words, as near  
as my memory serves me :  
“ Were you in the fight?”  
‘ ‘ Had a little taste of it, sa. ’ ’  
“ Stood your ground, did you ?”  
“ No, sa, I runs.”  
“ Run at the first fire, did you ?”  
“ Yes, sa, and would hab run soona, had I

“ Dat isn’t in my line, sa—cookin’s my per­  
feshun.”  
“Well, but have you- no regard for your

“Reputation’s nuffin to me by de side ob  
life.’ ’  
‘ ■ Do you consider your life worth more than  
other people’s ?”  
“ It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
“ Then you must value it very highly ?”  
“Yes, sa, I does—more dan all dis wuld—  
more dan a million ob dollars, sa ; for what  
would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref ?out  
ob him ? Self-preserbashun am de fust law

“ But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men ?’ ’  
“ Because different men set different values  
upon their lives—mine is not in de market. ’ ’  
■ ‘ But if you lost it. you would have the sat­  
isfaction of knowing that you died for your  
country.”  
“What satifaction would dat be to mewhen  
de power of feelin’ was gone ?”  
‘ * Then patriotism and honor are nothing to  
you ?’ ’  
“Nuffin whatever, sa—l regard dem as  
among de vanities.”  
“If our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government with­  
out resistance.”  
“ Yes, sa, dar would hab been no help for it.  
I wouldn’t put my life in de scale ’ginst any  
Gobernment dat eber existed, for no Gobern­  
ment could replace de loss to me.”  
‘ ‘ Do you think any of your company would  
have missed you if you had been killed ?’ ’  
“Maybe not, sa—a dead white man ain’t  
much to dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga—  
but I’d a missed myself, and dat was de pint

[Correspondence of the Cincinnati Gazette.]  
  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day an

“ Were yon in the fight 5”  
“Had a little taste or it sa?”

“No, sa, I runs.”  
“ Run at the first, did yon ?”  
“ Yes, sn, and would hah run soona hah I

“Reputation’s nuffin to me de side ob

“Bo you consider your life worth more than

“It’s worth more to me, sa,”  
  
“ Then you must value it very highly I”  
“ Yes, sa, I does—more dan all dis wuld—

A COLORED FALSTAFF  
  
A Western correspondent on one of the  
Mississippi gun-boats gives the following  
account of a spicy conversation with a  
philosophical colored man :  
I upon the hurricane deck to­  
day an elderly darkie with a very philo­  
sophical and retrospective cast of counte­  
nance, squatted upon his bundle toasting  
his shins against the chimney, and appa­  
rently plunged into a state of profound  
Meditation. Finding upon inquiry chat  
he belonged to the Ninth Illinois, one oFthe  
most gallantly behaved and heavily losing  
regiments at the Fort Donelson battle,  
and part of which was aboard, I began  
to interrogate him upon the subject.—  
His philosophy was so much in the Fels­  
taffian vein that I will give his views in  
his own words as near as my memory  
serves me:—

&#x27;Well, but have you no regard for your  
reputation  
&#x27;Reputation&#x27;s nuffin to me by the side  
ob life.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;Do you consider your life worth more  
than other people&#x27;s?&#x27;

&#x27;Then you must value it very highly

—more dan a million ob dollars, for what  
would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref  
out him 7 Selfpreserbashurn am de lust  
law wid me.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;But why should you act upon a differ­  
ent rule from other men?&#x27;  
Because different men sets different  
values upon dar lives—mine is nut in the  
market.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;But if you lost it, you would have the  
satisfaction of knowing that you died for  
your country.&#x27;  
  
&#x27;What satisfaction would dat be to me

A PHILOSOPHIC DARKEY.  
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Ga­  
zette, writing from the Cumberland river,  
gives the following humorous account of a  
colloquy with a philosophic darkey :  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to­  
day an elderly darkey with a very philo­  
sophical and retrospective cast of counte­  
nance, squatted upon his bundle toasting  
his shins against the chimney, and ap­  
parently plunged into a state of profound  
meditation. . Finding upon inquiry that  
he belonged to the 9th Illinois, one of the  
most gallantly behaved and heavy losing  
regiments of the Fort Donelson battle  
and part of which was aboard, I began  
to interrogate him upon the subject. His  
philosophy was so much in the Fallstaff­  
ian vein that I will give his views in his  
own words as near as my memory serves  
me :  
&#x27;Were you in the fight ?&#x27;  
&#x27;Had a little taste of it, sa.&#x27;  
&#x27;Stood your ground, did you ?&#x27;  
&#x27;No, sa, I runs.&#x27;  
&#x27;Run at the first fire, did you ?&#x27;  
Yes, sa, and would hab run soona had  
Iknownd it war coming.&#x27;  
&#x27;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to  
your courage.&#x27;  
&#x27;Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa cookin&#x27;s my  
perfeshun.&#x27;  
&#x27;Well, but have you no regard for  
your reputation ?&#x27;  
&#x27;Reputation&#x27;s nuffin to me by de side ob  
life.&#x27; -  
&#x27;Do you consider your life worth more  
than other peoples ?&#x27;  
&#x27;It&#x27;s worth more ta me, sa.&#x27;  
&#x27;Then you must value it very highly?  
&#x27;Yes, sa, I does more dan all dis  
wuld more dan a million ob dollars, sa,  
for what would dat be wuth to a man wid  
de bref out ob him ? Self-preserbashun  
am de fust law wid me.&#x27;  
But why should you act upon a differ­  
ent rule from other men ?&#x27;  
&#x27;Because different men set different  
values upon dar lives mine is not in de  
market.&#x27;  
&#x27;But if you lose it, you would have the  
satisfaction of knowing that yon died for  
your country.&#x27;  
&#x27;What satisfaction would dat be to me  
when de power ob feelin&#x27; was gone V .  
&#x27;Then patriotism and honor are nothing  
to you?&#x27;  
Nuffin whatever I regard dem as  
among de vanities.&#x27;  
&#x27;If our soldiers we like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government  
without resistance.&#x27;  
&#x27;Yes, sa, dar would hab been no help  
for it I wouldn&#x27;t put my life in de scale  
&#x27;gainst any Gobernment dat eber existed,  
for no Gobernment could replace de loss  
to me.&#x27;  
&#x27;Do you think any of your company  
would have missed you if you had been  
killed ?  
&#x27;May be not, sa a dead white man  
ain&#x27;t much to dese sogers, let alone a  
dead nigga but I&#x27;d a missed myself, and  
dat was de pint wid me.&#x27;  
It is safe to say that the dusty corpse  
of that African .will never darken the  
field of carnage.

of a colloquy with n philosophic darkey:  
i noticed upon tho hurricane deck to­  
day an elderly darkey wiih a very philo  
sophical and retrospective cast of counte  
nance, squatted upon his bundle toasting  
his shins against tho chimney, and appa-

ho belonged to tho Ninth Illinoisono of  
tho most gallantly behaved and heavy  
losing regiments at the Fort Donolson bat­  
tle and part of which was aboard, I be  
gan questioning hitu upon the subject.  
His philosophy was so much in the Fal­  
stnflian vein that I will give his views in  
his own words ns near as my memorv  
serves me:  
&quot;Wcro you in the fight?&quot;  
&quot; Had a&quot; littlo tasto of it, sa.&quot;

your reputation?&quot;  
&quot; Reputation s nuffin to mo by de side  
ob life.&quot;  
&quot; Do you consider your lifo worth moro  
than other people&#x27;s ?&quot;  
&quot; It s worth more to me, sa.  
&quot; Then you must value it very highly.&quot;  
&quot; Yes, sa, I docs, more dan all dis  
wurld, moro dan a million ob dollars, sa,  
for what would dat be wuth to a man  
wid do bref out ob him? Self-preserba-  
shun am do fust law wid me.&quot;  
&quot; By why should you act upon a dif  
ferent rulo from other men ?&quot;  
&quot; &#x27;Causo different men set different val  
ue on dar Jives mine is not in do mar­  
ket.&quot;&quot; But if you lost it, you would have  
the satisfaction of knowing that you died  
for your country.&quot;  
&quot; n hat satisfacshun would dat bo lo  
mo when do power ob feelin&#x27; was gone?&quot;  
&quot; Then patriotism and honor are noth­  
ing to you ?&quot;  
iNunin whatever, sa I regard dem  
as among do vanities.&quot;  
&quot; If our soldiers were liko you, traitors  
might havo broken up the government  
without resistance.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sa, dar would hab been no help  
for it. I wouldn&#x27;t put mv lifo in do scale  
&#x27;gainst any gobernment dat ebcr existed,  
for no gobernment would replace do loss  
to inc.  
&quot; Do you think any of your company  
would havo missed you if you had been  
killed ?&quot;  
&quot; May bo not, sa a dead while man  
ain&#x27;t much to dose sogers, lot alono a dead

A COLORED FALSTAFF.  
A Western correspondent on one of  
the Mississippi gun-boats gives the f fl­  
lowing account of a spicy conversation  
with a-philosophical colored man:—  
I noticed up n the hurricane deck, to­  
day, an elderly darkie with a very philo­  
sophical and retrospective cast of coun­  
tenance, squatted upon his bundle toast­  
ing his shins against the chimney, and  
apparently plunged into a state of pro­  
found meditation. Finding, upon in­  
quiry, that he belonged to the 9th Illi­  
nois, one of the most gallantly behaved  
and heavily losing regiments at the For!  
Donolson battle, anti part of which was  
aboard, I began to interrogate him on  
the subject. His phi’ospphy was so  
much in the Falstnffian vein, that I will  
give his views in his own words as near  
as my memory serves me:—  
“ Were you in the fight ?”  
“ Had a little taste of it, sa.”  
“Stood your ground, did you?”  
“ No, sa, 1 runs.”  
“ Run at the first fire, did you ?”  
“Yes, sa, and would hab run soon a,  
hab I knowd it war comin.&quot;  
“ Why, that wasn’t very creditable to  
your courage.”  
“ Dat isn’t in my line, sa—cookin’s  
mv perfeslinn.”  
‘ Well, but Lave*you no regard for  
your reputation  
“ Reputation’s nufiin to iiij by the side  
ob life.&quot;  
“Do you consider your life worth  
more than other people’s?”  
“ It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
“ Then, I suppose, you must value it  
very highly  
“Yes. sa, I does—more than nil the  
world—-more than a mihion ob dollars,  
sa. for what would dat be wuth to a man  
wid de href out ob him? Self presurba­  
sliun is de fu -t law wid me.”  
“ But why sin add you act on a differ­  
ent rule from other men ?”  
“ Because different men sets difierent  
values upon dar lives—mine is not in de  
market.”  
“But if you lost it, you would have  
the satisfaction of knowing that you lust  
it f&lt; r vour country.”  
“ What satisfaction would dat be to  
me when de power ob feelin’ was  
gone?”  
“1 ben patriotism and honor are noth­  
ing to you ?”  
“Nufiin whatever, sa—l regard dem  
as nn&gt;ong de vanities.”  
“If our soldiers were like you,traitors  
might have broken up the government  
without resistance.”  
“Yes, sa, dar would hab bin no help  
for it. I wouldn’t put my life in de  
scale ’gainst any government dat eber  
existed, for no gobernment could replace  
de loss to me.”  
“Do-you think nny of your company  
would have missed you if you had been  
killed ?”  
“ May be not. sa—a dead white man  
ain’t much to dese sojers, let alone a dead  
nigga—but I’d a missed myself, and dat  
was de pint wid me.”  
It is safe to say that the dusky corpse  
of that African will never darken the  
field of carnage,

belonged to the Ninth Illinois, one of th&#x27;  
most gallantly behaved and heavily losing  
regiments at the *Fort Donelson battle.  
and part of which was aboard. I began to  
interrogate him upon the subject. His  
philosophy was so much in the Falstaflian

As to men, we say, when the hair begins  
to fall out, the best plan is to have it cut

wash it well with warm soap suds; then rub  
into the scalp, about the roots of the hair

A PHILOSOPHIC NEGRO.  
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette, writing  
from the Cumberland river, gives the following hm­  
morous account of a colloquy with a philosophic  
negro:—  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day an eld­  
erly negro with a very philosophical and retrospec­  
tive cast of countenance, squatted upon his bundle,  
toasting his shins against the chimney, and apparent­  
ly plunged into a state of profound meditation. Find­  
ing by inquiry that he belonged to the Ninth Illinois,  
one of the most gallantly behaved and heavily los­  
ing regiments at the Fort Donelson battle,’ and  
part of which was aboard, I began to interrogate  
him upon the subject. His philosophy was so much  
in the Falstaffian vein that 1 will give his views in  
1 his own words, as near as my memory serves me:  
“ Were you in the fight?”  
“ Had a little taste of it, sa.”  
“ Stood your ground, did you ? ”  
“ No, sa, I runs.”  
“ Run at the first fire, did you ? ”  
“ Yes, sa. and would ha’ run soona had I know’d  
it war coinin’.”  
“ Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your cour­  
age.”  
“ Dat isn’t in my line, sa—cookin’s my perfeshun.”  
“ Well, but have you no regard for your reputa­  
tion ? ”  
“ Reputation’s nuffin to me by de side ob life.”  
“ Do you consider your life worth more than oth­  
er people&#x27;s ? ”  
“ It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.”  
“ Then you must value it very highly.”  
“ Yes, sa, 1 does—more dan all dis wuld—more  
; dan a million of dollars, sa, for what would dat be  
wuf to a man wid de bref out. of him ? Self perser­  
bashun am de fust law wid me.”  
“ But why should you act upon a different rule  
from other men ? ”  
“ Because different men set different values upon  
dar lives,—mine is not in de market,”  
“ But if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction  
of knowing that you died for your country.&quot;  
“ What satisfaction would dat be to me when do  
power ob feelin was gone ?”  
“ Then patriotism and honor are nothing to you ?”  
“Nuffin whatever, sa—l regard dem as among de  
vanities; and den de gobernment don’t know me; I  
hab no rights; may be sold like old hoss any day,  
and dat’s all.”  
“ If our old soldiers were like you, traitors might  
have broken up the Government without resistance.”  
“ Yes, sa, dar would hab been no help for it. I  
wouldn&#x27;t put my life in de scale ’ginst any Gobern­  
ment dat eber existed, for no Gobernment could re­  
place de loss to me.”

from the Cumberland river, gives the fol  
lowing humerous account of a colloquy with  
a philosophic negre;  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day  
an elderly negro with a very philosophical  
and rotrospective cast of countenance, squat

by inquiry that he belonged to the Ninth Il  
linois one of the most gallantly behaved and  
feavily loosing regiments at the Fort Don  
elson battle, and part of which was now ou  
board, I began to interogate him upon the  
subject. His philosophy was so much in  
the Falstaffian vein that I give his view  
in his own words, as near as my memory

&quot;Were you in the fight?

Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa---cookin&#x27;s my  
perfeshun.  
&quot;Well, but have you no regard for your  
reputation?  
&quot;Reputation&#x27;s nuffin to me by de side of  
life.&quot;  
Do you consider your life worth mor  
than other people&#x27;s?&quot;  
&quot;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.&quot;  
&quot;Then you valute it very highly.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sa, I does--more dan all dis wuld  
more dan a million ob dollars, sa, for  
what would dat be wuf to a man with de  
bref out of him? Self perserbation am de  
first law wid me.&quot;  
&quot;But why should you act upon a differ  
ent rule from other men?&quot;  
&quot;Because different men set a different  
value on dar lives,--mine is not in de mar  
ket  
&quot;But if you lest it, you would have the  
satisfaction of knowing yeu died for your

&quot;What satisfaction would that be to me  
when de power ob feelin gone?&quot;  
Then patriotism and honer are nothing

&quot;Nusfing whatever, sa--I regard dem

A correspondent of Hie Cincinnati &lt;**»-  
saetle, writing from the Cumberland river;  
gives the following humorous account ol n  
colloquy with o philosophic darkey:  
I noticed u, on the hurricane deck lo day  
an old darkey w ith a very philosophic conn  
tenance, squatted upon his bundle, toasting  
his shins against the chimney, and appur  
ontly plunged into a state of profound  
meditation. Finding upon inquiry that he  
belonged to the Ninth Illinois, one ol the  
most gallant behaved and heavy loosing  
regiments at the Fort Doneisou bailie, and  
part of which was oil board, I began to in­  
terrogate him iipoit that, subject, The phil­  
osophy was so much iu the Falstafliaii vein  
that 1 will give his own words as near as  
lay memory nerves me:  
•&#x27;Were you in the tight?  
&#x27;•Had a little taste of it. sa!”  
■“Stood your ground, did you?”  
“No, sa, 1 run!”  
“Run at the first Ore, did you?  
Hft, ftiitl would bub run hud  
I kuowed it war cumin.”  
“Why, that wasu’t very creditable to  
your courage.”  
“Dat isu’t my line, sa—cookin s my per­  
feshtiu.”  
“Well, but have you ao regard for your  
reputation?”  
“Reputation’s nufflu to me by de side ob  
life.” Iir  
“Do you consider your life worth more  
than other people&#x27;s?”  
“It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
“Then you must value it very highly?&quot;  
“Yes sa, 1 does—more dan all dis wuld—  
more dan a million oh dollars, sa, lor what  
would dat be wuth to a man wid de brel  
out ob him? Self preserbashum ain do lust  
liiw wid inc*&#x27;^  
“But why should yon uct upon a differ  
tnt rule from other men?”  
••Because different men set different val­  
ues upon dar lives—mine is not in lie mar­  
ktf *  
“But if yon lost it you would have the  
satisfaction of knowing you died Tor your  
country.”  
“Wliat satisfaction would dut be to me  
when the power ob feelin’ wus gone?”  
&quot;Then patriotism and honor are nothing  
to you?  
••Nufflu whatever, sa—1 regard detn as  
among de vanites.”  
“If our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government  
without resistance.”  
“Yes, sa. dar wonll hab been no help for  
it. 1 would’t put my life in de scale ’gin.n  
any Goburnment dat cber existed, for  
no Goborumeut could replace the loss to  
me.”  
“Do you think any of your company  
would have missed you if you had been  
killed?”  
“Maybe not, sa— a dead white man ain t  
much lo dese sojers. let alone a dead nig  
jr»r_but I’d a missed myself, uud dut was

A Philosophic Darkey.  
A correipotident of the Cincinuati Ga­  
zette , writing from the Cumberland river,  
gives the following humorous colloquy with  
a philosophic darkey:  
I noticed upon the hurrioaue deok to-day  
an elderly darkey with a very philosophical  
and retrospective cast of countenauce,  
squatted upon hit bundle, roasting his shins  
against the chimney, and apparently plung­  
ed into a state of profound meditation. ?  
Finding, upon inquiry, that he belonged to  
the 9th Illinois, one of the most gallant be­  
haved and heavy losing regimeuts at Fort  
Donaldson battle, and part of which was  
aboard, I began to interrogate hirti upon the  
subject. Hit philosophy was so much in  
the Falstaflian vein that I will give his views  
in his own words as near a? my memorv  
  
serves me :  
&quot;Were vou in the tight?&quot;  
&quot;We had a little taste of it, sa.&quot;  
&#x27;?Stood your ground, did you?&quot;  
&quot;No sa, 1 runs/&#x27;  
&quot;Ruu at the first tire did you?&#x27;  
&quot;Yes, and would hah run sooner, had I  
know&#x27;d it war comin. &#x27;  
&quot;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to  
your courage.&quot;  
&quot;Dat isn&#x27;t iu my hue, ? ? cookin&#x27;s my  
profession.&quot;  
&quot;Well, but have you uo regard for your  
reputation?&quot;  
&quot;Reputation&#x27;s imtiin to me by de side ob  
life.&quot;  
  
&quot;Do you cousider your life worth more;  
than other people&#x27;s/  
?&#x27;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.;&#x27;  
&quot;Then you must value jour lite highly.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, aa, I do^i? more than all dis wuld,  
more than a m, lion ob dollars, sa, for what  
would dat b v/urth to a man wid de bref

&quot;But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men? &#x27;  
&#x27;&#x27;Because different men set different  
valuer upon dar lives; mine is not in de  
market.&quot;  
&#x27; But if you lost it, you would have the  
satisfaction of knowiug that you di?&lt;i tor

&quot;If our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government with­  
out resistance.&quot;  
  
&quot;Yea, sa, dar would have been no helpj

A NEgTO PhILOsOPHER.  
A correspondent of the Cincinnatti Ca­  
zette, writing from the Cumberland river,  
gives the following humorous colloquy with  
a philosophic darkey:  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to day  
an elderly darkey, with a very philosophi  
cal and retrospective cast of countenance,  
squstted upon his bundle, toasting his  
shins against the chimney, and apparently  
plunged into a state of profound medita­  
tion Finding, upon inquiry, that he be  
longed to the 9th Illinois, one of the most  
gelfandy behaved and heavy losing regie  
mente at the wort wonelson battle, and a  
part of wuton was aboard, I began to in  
terrogate him upon the subject. His phi­  
losophy was so much in the Falstaffian vein  
that I will give his views in his own words  
as near as my memory serves me:  
Where you in the fight?  
Had a little taste of it, sa.  
Stood your ground, did you?  
No, sa, I runs.  
Run at the first fire, did you?  
Yes, and would hab run sooner had I  
know&#x27;d it war comin&#x27;.  
Why, that wasn&#x27;t very credituble to your  
courage.  
Dat ien&#x27;t in my line,--cookin&#x27;s my pro.­  
 wolt but have you no regard for your  
reputation?  
Reputation&#x27;s nuffin to me by the side ob  
life.  
Do you consider your life worth more  
than other people&#x27;s?  
It is worth more to me, sa.  
Then you must value your life highly?  
Yoe, ea, I does, more can all dis world  
more than a million ob dollars sa, for what  
would dat be wurth to a man wid de bref  
out ob him? Self preserbashum am de  
fust law wid me.  
But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men?  
Because different men set different val  
ues upon dar lives; mine is not in de mark­  
But, if yoe lost it, you woald heve the  
satisfaction of knowing that you died for  
your country.  
What satisfaction would dat be to me  
when de power of feelin was gone?  
Then patriotism and honor are nothing  
to you?  
Nuffin whatever, sa: I regard dem as  
among de vanities  
If our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government  
without resistance.  
Yes, sa; dar would have been no help  
for it: wouldn&#x27;t put my life in the scale  
ginst any Government that ever existed  
for no government could replace de toss to  
mGs  
Da you think any of your company  
would have missed you if you had been  
killed?

A PHILOSOPHIC DARKEY.  
  
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette  
writing from the Cumberland River, gives the  
following humorous colloquy with a philosophic  
darkey :  
  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day an  
elderly darkey with a very philosophical and  
retrospective, cast of countenance, squatted  
upon his bundle, toasting his shins against  
the chimney, and apparently plunged into a  
state of profound meditation. Finding, upon  
inquiry, that he belonged to the 9th Illinois;  
one of the most gallantly behaved and heavy  
losing regiment at Fort - Donelson battle; and  
part of which was aboard, I began to interro­  
gate him on the subject. His philosophy was  
so much in the Falstaffian vein that 1 will give  
his views in his own words as near as my  
  
memory serves me :  
&quot;Were you in the fight ?&quot;  
&quot;Had a little taste of it, sa.&quot;  
&quot;Stood your ground, did you 7&quot;  
&quot;No sa, I runs.&quot;  
&quot;Run at the first fire, did you ?&quot;  
&quot;Yes: and would hab run sooner had I know­  
ed it war contin&#x27;.&quot;  
&quot;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to your  
courage.&quot;  
&quot;Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa--cookin&#x27;s my per­  
leshin.&quot;  
&quot;Well, but have you no regard for your  
reputation ?&quot;  
&quot;Reputation nuffin to me by de side ob  
life.&quot;  
  
&quot;Do you consider your life worth more than  
other people&#x27;s ?&quot;  
&quot;Its worth more to me, sa.&quot;  
&quot;Then you must value your, life very high­  
ly ?&quot;  
  
&quot;Yes, ea, I does—more dan all dis wuld,  
more dan a million ob dollahs, sa, for what  
would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref out  
ob him? Self-preserbashun am de fust law  
wid me.&quot;  
  
&quot;But why should you act upon a different  
rule froin other men?&quot;  
&quot;Because different men set different values  
upon dar lives; wine is not in the market.&quot;  
&quot;But if you lost it, you would have the sat­  
isfaction of knowing that you died for your

A Negro Philosopher.—A correspond­  
ent of the Cincinnati Gazette, writing from  
the Cumberland river, gives the following hu­  
morous colloquy with a philosophic darkey.:  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck an elder­  
ly darkey with a very philosophical and ret­  
rospective cast of countenance, squatted upon  
his bundle toasting his shins against the chim­  
ney, and apparently plunged into a state |of  
profound meditation. Finding, upon inquiry  
that he belonged to the Ninth Illinois, one of  
the most gallantly behaved and heavy losing  
regiments at the Fort Donelson battle, and  
a part of which was aboard, I began to inter­  
rogate him upon the subject. His philosophy  
was so much in the Falstaffian style that I  
will give bis views in his own words, as near  
as my memory serves :  
* Were you in the fight ?&#x27;  
&#x27; Had a little taste of it, sa.&#x27;  
&#x27; Stood your ground, did you ?&#x27;

know&#x27;d it war coming.&#x27;

courage,&#x27;

fession &#x27;  
&#x27;Well, but have you no regard for your  
reputation ?&#x27;

life.&#x27;  
&#x27; Do you consider your life worth more than

* It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa,&#x27;  
&#x27;Then you must value your life very high­  
ly?&#x27;  
&lt; Yes, sa, I does, more dan all dis world;  
more than a million of dollars, sa; tor what  
would dat be worth to a man wid de bref out  
on him ? Self-preserbashun is de fust law  
wid me.&#x27;  
&#x27; But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men ?&#x27;  
Because different men set different values  
upon their lives; mine is not in de market.&#x27;  
&#x27; But if you lost it, you would have the aat­  
isfation of knowing that you died foe your

A Philosophic Darkey.  
A correspondent of the Cincinnati  
Gazette, writing from the Cumberland  
river, gives the following humorous ac­  
count of a colloquy with a philosophic  
darkey:  
&#x27; I noticed upon the* hurricane deck  
to-day an elderly darkey with a veryphil­  
usophical and retrospective east of coun­  
tenance, squatted upon his bundle toast­  
ing his shins ngainst the chimney, and»  
apparently plunged-nto a state of pro­  
found meditation. Finding upon inqui­  
ry that he belonged to the Oth Illinois,  
one of Ihe most gallantly behaved and  
heavy loosiug regiments at the Tort Don­  
elson bat ile. aud part of which was aboard,  
I began to interrogate him upon the sub­  
ject. Ilis philosophy was sd mucli in the  
vein, that I will give his views  
in bis own words, as near as my memory  
serves me.  
&quot; Were you in the fight ?&quot;  
&quot; Had a little taste of it, sa.&quot;  
&quot; Stood your ground, did you?&quot;  
&quot; No, sa, I runs.&quot;  
&quot; Bun at the first fie, did you?&quot;  
&quot; Ye°, sa, and would have run soona,  
if I kuow&#x27;d it war coming.&quot;  
&quot; Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to  
your courage.&quot;  
&quot; Hat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa—eookin&#x27;s my  
purl&#x27;eshun.&quot;  
&quot; Well, but have you no regard for  
your reputation ? &#x27; .  
&quot; Reputation&#x27;s nufiin to me by the side  
of life.&quot;  
&quot; Do yoti consider your lite worth more  
than other people&#x27;s?&quot;  
&quot;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.&quot;  
&#x27; Then you must value it very highly?&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sa, I does—more than ali this  
|woild—mo.e dan a million ob dollars;  
for what would I hat be wuth to a man  
with the href out of him? Self-preser­  
bashumam de fust law wid me.&quot;  
• But why should you act upon a d&#x27;ffer­  
cutrule fiom oilier men?&quot;  
&quot;Because different men set different  
values upon dar lives—mine isu t in the  
market.&quot;  
&quot;But if you lost it, you would have  
(lie satisfaction of knowing that you died  
for your country.&quot;  
&quot;What satisfaction wou&#x27;d that be to  
me when de power ob feoliu&#x27; was goue ?  
&quot;Then patriotism aud honor are noth­  
ing to you ?&quot;  
I &quot;Nufiin wheievc.&#x27;, sa—1 regard dem  
as among de vanities.&quot;  
&quot;if our soldieis were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the government  
without resistance.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sa. dar would hab been no help  
for it.l wouldn&#x27;t put my life in de scale  
&#x27;giv st no gobernment dat eber existed,  
for no gobeiuuient could replace de loss  
to me.&quot;  
&quot;Dovouihink any of your company  
would haved missed you if you had been  
&quot;killed?&quot;  
&#x27;-May be not, sa,—a dead while man  
ain&#x27;t much to dese sogers, let aioneadead  
uiggft—but I&#x27;d missed myself, aud dat  
was de pint wid me&quot;  
It is safe to say that the dusky corpse  
of that African will never darken the  
field of carnage. .

A COWARD’S ESTIMATE OF LIFE.  
The following from the Cincinnati Gazette illus-  
trates the feelings not of one person, but of a whole  
class of creatures, we will not call them men, who  
have disgraced our army.  
  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to-day an elder-  
ly darkey with a very philosophical and retrospective  
cast of countenance, squatted upon his bundle toast-  
ing his shins against the chimney, and apparently  
plunged in a state of deep meditation. Finding upon  
inquiry that he belonged to the 9th Iilinois, one of  
the most gallantly behaved and heavily losing regi-

was aboard, I began to interrogate him upon the sub-  
ject. His philosophy was so much in the Falstaflian  
vein that I will give his views in his own words, as  
near as my memory serves me.  
  
“ Were you in the fight ?”  
  
“ TIad a little taste of it, sa.”  
  
“ Stood your ground, did you?”  
  
* No, sa, I runs.”  
  
“ Run at the first fire, did you ?”  
  
“ Yes,—sa, and I would had run soona, had I knoad  
it war coming.”  
  
« Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your cour-  
age.”  
  
“ Dat isn’t in my line, sa—cookin’s my profeshun.”  
  
“ Well, but have you no- regard for your reputa-  
tion.”  
  
“« Reputation’s nofin by the side of life.”  
  
“ Do you consider your life worth more than other  
people’s ?”  
  
“It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
  
“Then you must value it vety highly ?”  
  
“ Yes, sa, I does—more dan all dis world—more  
dan a million ob dollars, sa, for what would that be  
wuth to a man with the bref out of him? Self-pres-  
erbashun am de fust law wid me.”  
  
“ But why should you act upon a different rule  
from other men ?”  
  
* Because different men set different values upon  
dar lives—mine is not in the market.”  
  
“ Rut if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction  
of knowing that you died for your country.”  
  
“ What satisfaction would dat be to me when de  
power of feelin’ was gone ?”  
  
“The patriotism and honor are nothing to you? ”  
  
“ Nuflia whatever, sa—I regard demas among de  
vanities.”  
  
“ If our soldiers were like you, traitors might have  
broken up the government without resistance.”  
  
“ Yes sa, dar would have been no help for it. I  
wouldn’t put my life in de scale ‘ginst no gobernment  
dat eber existed, for no gobernment could replace  
de loss to me.”  
  
“ Do you think any of your company would have  
missed you if you bad been killed ? ”  
  
“ May be not, sa—a dead white man ain&#x27;t much to  
dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga—but I’d a missed  
myself, and dat was de _ wid me.”  
  
It is safe to say that the dufky corpse of that Afri-  
can will never darken the field of carnage.

.  
A PHILOSOPHIC DARKEY. Acor-  
respondent of the Cincinnati Cazette,  
writing from the Cumberland river,  
gives the following humerous account  
of a colloquy with a philosophic dar­  
key:  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck  
to-day an elderly darkey with a vory  
philosophical and retrospective cast of  
countenance, squatted upon his bundle  
toasting his shins against the chimney,  
and apparently plunged into a state of  
profound meditation. Finding upon  
inquiry that he belonged to the Ninth  
Illinois, one of the most gallantly be­  
haved and heavy losing regiments,  
and part of which was abroad, I began  
to interrogate him upon the subject.  
His philosophy was so much in the  
Falstaffian vein that I will give his  
views in his own words, as near as my  
memory serves me:  
&quot;Were you in the fight?&quot;  
&quot;Had a little taste of it, sa.&quot;  
&quot;Stood your ground, did you?&quot;  
&quot;No, sa, I runs.&quot;  
Run at the first fire, did you?&quot;  
&quot;Yes,--sa, and wonld hab run  
soona, had I knowd it war coming.&quot;  
&quot;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable  
to your courage.&quot;  
&quot;Dat isn&#x27;t in my lme, sa--cookin&#x27;s  
my pertenshun.&quot;  
&quot;Well, but have you no regard for  
your reputation?&quot;  
&quot;Reputation&#x27;s nuffin to me by the  
side ob life.&quot;  
Do you consider your life worth  
more than other people&#x27;s?&quot;  
&quot;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.&quot;  
&quot;Then you must value it very  
highly?&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sa, I does--more dan all dis  
world--more dan a million ob dollars,  
for what would dat be wuth, to a man  
with bref out of him? Self preserba­  
shum am de fust law wid me.&quot;  
&quot;But why should you act upon a  
different rule from other men?&quot;  
&quot;Because different men set different  
values upon dar lives--mine is not in  
the market.&quot;  
&quot;But if you lost it, you would have  
the satisfaction of knowing that you  
died for your country.&quot;  
&quot;What satisfaction would dat be to  
me when de power of feelin was  
gone?&quot;  
&quot;Then patriotism and honor are  
nothing to you?&quot;  
&quot;Nuffin, whatever, sa--I regard  
dem as among de vanities.&quot;  
&quot;If our soldiers were like you, trai­  
tors might have broken up the Gov­  
ernment without resistance.&quot;  
Yes, sa, dar would hab been no  
help for it. I wouldn&#x27;t put my life in  
de scale gainst no gobernment dat eber  
existed, for no gobernment could re­  
place de loss to me.&quot;  
&quot;Do you think any of your com­  
pany would have missed you if you  
had been killed?&quot;  
&quot;May be not, sa--a dead white  
man aint much to dese sogers, let alone  
a dead nigga--but I&#x27;d a missed my­  
self, and dat was de pint wid me.&quot;

The compiler of “Old Abe’s Jokes” gives the following as a  
story told by the President. It is, however, far more charac-  
teristic of the elderly Southern “darkey” than of young Africa  
of our Northern cities, which is to-day enlisting by thousands  
in the army.  
  
“Upon the hurricane-deck of one of our gunboats, an elderly darkey, with a very  
philosophical and retrospective cast of countenance, squatted upon his bundle,  
toasting his shins against the chimney, and apparently plunged into a state of pro-  
found meditation. Finding, upon inquiry, that he belonged to the 9th Dlinois, one  
of the most gallantly behaved and heavy-losing regiments at the Fort Donelson  
battle, and part of which was aboard, began to interrogate him upon the subject:

“¢Stood your ground, did you?’

“¢Then you must value it very highly ?’  
  
‘“¢ Yes, sa’, I does, more dan all dis wuld, more dan a million of dollars, sa’, for  
what would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref out ob him? Self-preservation am  
de fust law wid me.’  
  
‘“*¢ But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?’  
  
““¢Becase different men sot differen values upon their lives: mine is not in de  
market.’  
  
«But if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you died  
for your country.’

A PHILOSOrniCAL DARKEY..  
An elderly darkey, with . a very  
philosophical and retrospective cast  
of countenance, was squatting upon  
his bundle on the hurricane deck of  
one of the western river steamers,  
toasting his shins against the chim­  
ney, and apparently plunged, in a  
state of profound meditation. His  
appearance and dress indicated fa­  
miliarit&#x27; with camp life, and it be  
ing soon after the seige and capture  
of Fort Donelson,T was inclined to  
disturb his reveries, and on interro­  
gation, found he had been with the  
Union forces at that place, when -1  
questioned him .further. His phil­  
osophy was so much in the Fal­  
staflian vein, that I will give

A PHILOSOPHICAL DARKEY.  
A. FALSTATHAN VIEW OF XVA.R.  
An elderly darkey, with a very philosophical  
and retrospective cast of countenance, was  
squatting upon his bundle on the hurricane  
deck of one of the Western river steamers,  
toasting his shins against the chimney, and  
apparently plunged in a state of profound  
meditation. His dress and appearance indi­  
cated familiarity with camp life, and it being  
soon after the siege and capturs of Fort Don­  
elson, I was inclined to disturb his reveries,  
and on interrogation found that he had been  
with the Union forces at that place, when I  
questioned him further. His philosophy was  
so much in tho Falstaffian vein that I will give  
his views in his own words as near as my  
memory serves me.  
“Were you in the fight?”  
“ I had a little taste of it, sah.”  
“Stood your ground, did you?”  
“ No, sail, I runs.”  
“Run at the first fire, did you?”  
“Yes, sah, and would have run soonah had I  
know’d it was cornin’.”  
“Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your  
courage.”  
“Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sah—cookin’s my pro­  
fession.”  
“ Well, but have you no regard for your rep­  
utation ?”  
“ Reputation 1 Nuffin to me by de side ob  
life 1”  
“ Do you consider yonr life worth more than  
other people’s ?”  
“It’s wuth more tome, sah.”  
“Then you must value it very highly?”  
“Yes, sah, I does; more dan ad dis world ;  
more dan a million dollahs, sah; for what  
would dat be wuth to a man wid de href out of  
him ? Self-preservation am de fust law wid  
me, sah.”  
“But why should you act on a different rule  
from other men ?”  
“ ’Cause, sah, different men sets different  
value upon der selves; my life is not in de  
market.”  
“ But if you lost it you would have the satis­  
faction of knowing that you died for your  
country.”  
“ What satisfaction would dat be to me, when  
the power of feelin’ was gone ?”  
“ Then patriotism and honor are nothing to  
you?”  
“ Nuffin’ whatever, sah—l regard dem as  
anseng de varieties.”  
“If. our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government with­  
out resistance.”  
“Yes, sah ; der would hab been no help for  
it. I wouldn’t put my life in de scales ginst  
any guberment dat eber existed, for no guber­  
ment could replace de loss to me. ’Speot,  
dough, dat de guberment safe, if da all like  
me.”  
“Do you think any of your company would  
have missed you if you had been killed ?”  
“ May be not, sah. A dead white man ain’t  
much to dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga ;  
but I’d a missed myself, and dat was de pint  
wid me.”  
It is safe to say that the darkey corpse of  
that African will never darken the field of  
carnage. . ... .

A PHILOSOPHICAL UAUKEY,  
  
An elderly darkey, with&#x27;a very philoso  
pbic.il and retrospective castof countenance,  
was squatting upon his bundle on the bur  
ricaoe di ck of one of the Western steamers,  
toasting his shins against the chimney, and  
apparently plunged in a state of profound  
meditati in. _ liis dress and appearance in  
dicated familiarity with camp life, and it  
being soon after the sejge and capture of  
Fort Oonelson, I w«a inclined to distuib  
his reveries, and on interrogation found  
that he&#x27;had been with the Union forces at  
that place, when I&#x27;questioned him further.  
His philosophy was so much in the Falstaf­  
fian vein that I will give his views in his  
own words as near as my memory will serve  
me.  
“Were you in the fight ?”  
“I had a little taste of it, sa.”  
“Stood your ground, did you, my man ?”  
“No, sa, I runs.”  
“Run at first fire, did yon ?”  
“Yes, sa, ai ’ would hab run soona bad  
I fcnow&#x27;d it &lt;vus cmiringr” -  
“M hy, that was not creditable to your  
courage.”  
“Dal ianlluitt my line, sa—cookiu’s my  
profession.”  
“Well, but have you no regard for ypjir  
reputation ?”  
“Reputation ! nuffiu to me by de side of  
life.”  
“Do you consider your lile worth more  
than other people’s ?”  
“It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
“Then you must value it very highly.”  
“ • es, sa, I does ; more dan all dis world;  
more .tan a million dollars, sa ; for what  
would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref  
out of him. Self preserbashum am de fust  
law wid roe, sa.”  
But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men in this mutter ?”  
“Cause, sa. diflereut men set different  
value upon dor selves, my life is not in de  
market.”  
“But if you lost it you w mid have the  
satisfaction of knowing that you died for  
your country.”  
“What satisfaction would dat be to me  
when de power of’ feelin’ was gone ?”  
“Then patriotism and honor are nothing  
to you ?”  
“Nuffin’, whatever, sa—I regard dem as  
among de varieties.”  
“It our soldiers were like you, traitors  
might have broken up the Government  
without res&#x27;stance.”  
“Yes, sa, der would hare been no help  
frr it. I wouldn’t put my life in de scales  
ginst any guverment dat eber existed, for  
no guberment could replace de loss to me.  
Spect, dough, dat de guberment’s safe, it  
da all HI e me ”  
“Do you think any of your company  
would have misted you if you had been  
killed ?”  
“May be not, sa. A dead whiteman  
ain’t much to dese sogers, let alone a dead  
nigga; but I’d a .. issed myself, and dal  
was de pint wid me.”  
It is safe to say that the dark corpse of  
that African will never darken the field of  
carnage.

A Darkey’s View of War.  
An elderly darkey, with a very  
philosophical and retrospective cast  
of coantanance, was sitting upon his  
bundleon the hurricane deck of one  
of the Western river steamers, toast­  
ing his shins against the chimney,  
and apparently plunged in a state of  
profound meditation. His dress and  
appearance indicated familiarity  
with camp life, and it being soon  
after the siege and capture of Fort  
Donelson, I was inclined to disturb  
his reveries, and on interrogation, 1  
found he bad been with the Union  
forces at that place, when I ques­  
tioned him further. His philosophy  
was so much in the FaislafHiau vein,  
that I will give his views tc his own  
words, as near as my memory  
serves me :  
‘Were you in the fight?&#x27;  
‘I had a litcle taste of it. sah.’  
‘Stood your ground, uid you ?’  
‘.No, sah, I runs.’  
‘Hud at the first fire, did you ?&#x27;  
‘I os, sab,; and would have run  
soonah, had I knowed it was com­  
in.&#x27;  
‘Why, that wasn’t very creditable  
to your courage !’  
‘Dat isn’t in my line, sail; cookin’s  
my profession.’  
‘Well, but havo you no regard for  
your reputation ?’  
“■Reputation&#x27;s nuftin to me by de  
side of life.’  
‘Doyou consider your life worth  
more than other people’s?&#x27;  
‘lt’s wuth more to me, sah.’  
1 ‘Then you must value it very higb­  
‘Ycs, sah, I does ; more dan all dis  
world; more dan a million of dol­  
lars, sah ; for what would dat be  
wuth to a man wid do bref out of  
him ? Self-preservation am de fust  
law wid me, sah.’ -  
‘But why should you act on a dif­  
ferent principle from other men ?’  
‘Causo, sah, different men sets  
different value on deirselves ; my life  
is not in d« market.’  
‘But if you lost it you would have  
the satisfaction of kuewing that you  
died four your country.’  
‘What satisfaction would dat bo to  
me when de power of feelin’ was  
go no ?’  
‘Then patriotism and honor are  
nothing to you ?’  
‘NufHn whatever, sal.—l regard  
dem among the vanities.’  
‘lf iur soldiers were like you, the  
government might havo been broken  
up without resistance.’  
•Yes, sah, dar would havo boon no  
help for it. I wouldn’t put my life  
in tho scales against any guhsrment  
dat ebor existed, for no gubermont  
could eber replace the loss to me.  
Spect dough, dat be gnberraent safe  
if da all Uke me.&#x27;  
‘Do you think any of your com­  
pany would have missed you if you  
bad been killed ?’  
‘May bo not, sah. A dead white  
man ain’t much to deso sogers, let  
alone a dead nigga; but I’d misH  
myself, and dat was do pint wid me.’  
It is safe to say that tho corpse

1 When the late Joseph Glenn, one of the prin­  
cipal proprietors of the Gazette, was following  
, tho army m the South, during the war, chiefly  
to indulge, his curiosity to see a battle, and writ­  
ing letters to the Gazette, he had a conversa­  
tion with a colored person on the deck of a  
steamboat on the Tennessee river, which ha  
gave in one of his letters. It has gone the  
rounds of the press many times, and deserves  
to keep on ; therefore we give it a new send-off.  
The colored person’s adherence to the utilita-  
1 rian philosophy, and the concise arguments by  
which he maintained it, are remarkable. He  
expressed more laconically all that,is contained  
in Falstaff’s discourse upon honor, and much  
more. The line of questioning shows the pecu­  
liar, quiet humor of the questioner :  
A PHILOSOPHICAL DAB KEY.  
An elderly darkey, with a very philosophical  
and retrospective cast of countenance, was  
squatting upon his bundle on the hurricane  
1 deck of the steamer, toasting his shins against  
the chimney, and apparently plunged in a state  
of profound meditation. His uress and appear­  
ance indicated familiarity with camp life, and it  
being soon after the siege and capture of Fort  
Donelson, I was inclined to disturb his reveries,  
and on interrogation found that ha had been  
with the Union forces at that place, when I  
questioned him further. His philosophy was so  
much in the Falstaffian vein that I will give his  
views in his own words as near as my memory  
will serve ma :  
“Were you in the fight ?”  
“I had a little taste of it, sa.”  
** Rtqod your ground, did you ?”  
“No, sa ; I runs,”  
“ Run at the first fire, did you ?”  
“Yes, sa, an’ would hah run soona had I  
know’d it was cornin’.”  
“Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your  
courage.” .  
“Dat isn’t my line, sa—cookin’s my profes­  
sion.”  
“Well, but have you no regard for your rep­  
utation ?”  
“Reputation nuffin to me by de side ob life.”  
“Do you consider your life worth more taan  
other people’s?”  
“ It’s worth more to me, so.”  
&#x27; “ Then you must value it very highly.”  
“ Yes, sa, I does; more dan all dis world; more  
dan a million dollars, sa; for what would dar be  
t wuth to a man war de bref out ob him ? Self­  
preserbation is de fust law wid me sa.”  
“But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other mon ?”  
, “ ’Cause, sa, different men sets different value  
upon derselves; my life is not in de market.”  
t “ But if you lost it, you would have the sat­  
isfaction of knowing that you died fox your  
country.”  
“What satisfaction would dat be to me when  
I de power ob feelin’ was gone ?”  
; “ Then patriotism and honor are nothing to  
’ you?”  
&#x27; “ Nuffin whatever, sa—l regard dem as among  
r de varieties.”  
“If our soldiers were like you, traitors might  
1 have broken up the Government without resust­  
&#x27; ance.”  
&#x27; “Yes, sa; der would hab been no help for it.  
&#x27; I wouldn’t put my life in de scales ginst any  
guberment dat eber existed, for no gubermont  
i could replace de loss to me. ‘Spect, dough dat  
do guberment’s safe, if da all like me.”  
“Do you think any of your company would  
have missed you if you had been killed?”  
“May be not, sa. A dead white man ain’t  
much to dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga; but  
. I’d a missed myself, and dat was de pint wid

 of the  
Cincinnati Gazette, writing from the Cum-  
berland river, gives the following humorous  
colloquy with a philosophic darkey :  
I noticed upon the hurricane deck an el-  
derly darkey, with a very philosophical and  
retrospective cast of countenance, squatted  
upon his bundle, toasting his shins against  
the chimney, and plunged into a state of  
profound meditation. Finding, upon inqui-  
ry, that he belonged to the 9th Illinois, one  
of the most gallantly behaved and heavy  
losing regiments at Fort Donelson battle,  
and a part of which was aboard, I began to  
interrogate him upon the subject. His phil-  
osophy was so much in the Falstaffian style  
that I will give his views in his own words,  
as near as my memory serves me:  
‘*Were you in the fight?”  
‘**Had a little taste of it, sa.”  
“Stood your ground, did you!  
‘*No, sa, I runs.”  
‘Run at first fire, did you?”  
*“*Yes, and would have run sooner, had I  
knowed it war comin’.”  
‘*Why that wasn’t very creditable to your  
courage.”  
*“*Dat isn’t in my line, sa—cookin’s my  
perfession.”  
“But have you no regard for your repu-  
tation?”  
  
‘‘Reputation’s nuffin to me by de side ob

“Do you consider your life worth more

“It’s worth more to me, sa.”  
“Then you must value your life very  
highly?”  
**Yas, sa, I does; more dan all dis world;

would dat be worth toa man wid de bref  
out of him? Self-preserbation am de fust  
law wid me.”  
**But why should you act upon a different

“Because different men set different val-

Western river steamers, toasting his shins  
against the chimney, and apparently  
plunged in a state of profound medita­  
tion. His dress and appearance indicated  
familiarity with camp life, and it being  
soon after the siege and capture of Fort  
Donaldson, I was inclined to disturb his  
 reveries, and on interrogation found that  
he had been with the Union forces at that  
place, when I questioned further. His  
philosophy was so peculiar, that I will

&quot;’Cause, sa, dilFrent men sets different

“Hut if you lost it you would have  
the satisfaction of knowing that you died

“What satisfaction would dat be to me,

not such a man as should represent their  
party in Wisconsin, and yet they know  
that if an attempt is made to set the old  
gentleman aside he will roar like a hurt  
lion, as will a few of his backers. They  
pass by the cage and look at William R.  
and wish the old fellow were exchanged  
for a better breed, bnt for the life of  
them they dare not stir the animal np  
with their canes. If something only  
could happen to get Mr. Taylor out of  
the way, how that portion of the party  
would rejoice. Had they supposed  
therejwas any.chance cf securing nn elec­  
tion in 1873, Mr. Taylor is about the  
last man they would have hit upon.  
They really want Colonel Robinson, or

A Philosophical Colored Man.  
An elderly colored man, with a very philo­  
sophical and retrospective cast of counten­  
ance, was squatting upon his bundle on the  
hurricane-deck ot one of the Western-river  
steamers, toasting his shins against the chim­  
ney, and apparently plunged in a state of  
orofound meditation. His dress and appear­  
ance indicated familiarity with camp life,and  
it being soon after the siege and capture of  
Fort Donelson, I was inclined to disturb his  
reveries, and, on interrogation, found that he  
had been with the Union forces at that place,  
when I questioned further. His philosophy  
was so peculiar, that I will give his views in  
his own words as near as memory will serve  
me;  
&quot;Were you in the fight?&quot;  
&quot;I had a little taste of it, sab.&quot;  
&quot;Stood your ground did you?&quot;  
&quot;No, sah, I runs.&quot;  
&quot;Run at the first fire, did you?&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sab, an&#x27; would have run soopa, had I  
know&#x27;d it was cornin&#x27;.&quot;  
&quot;Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to your  
courage.&quot;  
&quot;Dat isn&#x27;t my line, sah —cookin&#x27;» my pro­  
feshun.&quot;  
&quot;Well! but have you no regard for your  
reputation?&quot;  
&quot;Reputation s miffin to me by de side of  
my life.&quot;  
&quot;Do you consider your life worth more  
than other people&#x27;s?&quot;  
&quot;it&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.&quot;  
&quot;Then you must value it very highly?&quot;  
&quot;Y T es, sah, 1 does; more dan all dis world—  
more dan a million dollars—for what would  
that be worth to a man with dc breth out ob  
him? Self perserbashun is de first law wid  
me.&quot;  
&quot;But why should you act upon a different  
rule from other men?&quot;  
&quot;Cause, sah, different men set different  
value on derselvee; mv life is not on vie mar­  
ket.&quot;  
&quot;But if you lost it you would have the  
satisfaction* of knowing you died for your  
country.&quot;  
&quot;What satissactioa would dat be to me  
when de power of feelin&#x27; was gone?&quot;  
&quot;Then patriotism and honor are nothing to  
you?&quot;  
&quot;Nuffin whatever, sah.&quot;  
&quot;If our soldiers were like you traitors might  
have broken up the Government without re  
sistance.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sab; der would have bin no help for

no gubernment dat ever existed, for no gub­

man, with a very philosophical and  
retrospective cast of countenance, was  
squatting upon his bundle on the  
hurricane deck of one of the &quot;Western

A number of physicians and other citi­  
zens of Boston have united in a circular  
addressed to the teachers of that city, urg­  
ing them to use all their influence and  
authority to suppress the use ef tobacco  
among the children in their schools. There  
is no doubt that this habit is becoming  
more and more prevalent among children,  
to whom it is eqnally certain to be injuri­  
ous. The makers of cheap cigarettes are  
largely responsible for tbis unfortunate

A PHILOSOPHICAL DARKEY.  
  
An elderly darkey, with a very philoso­  
phical and retrospective cast of counte­  
nance, was squatting upon hit bundle on  
the hurricane deck of one of the western  
steamers, toasting his shins against the  
chimney and apparently plunged in a state  
of profound meditation. His dresa and  
appearance indicated familiarity with camp  
life ; and it being soon after the siege and  
capture of Fon Donelsorj, I was inclined  
to disturb his reveries. On interrogation  
I found that ha had been with the Union  
forces at that place, when I questioned him  
further. His philosophy was so much in  
the Falstaffian vein that I will give his  
views in his own words, as near as memory  
will serve me :  
&quot; Were you in the fight!&quot;  
&quot; I had a little taste of it, sah.&quot;

&quot;Then you must value it very highly.&quot;  
&quot;Yes, sab, I does; more than all dis

For what would dat be wid de bref out of

&quot; But why should you act on a different

steamboat, was found beside the smoke-  
stack, sitting on a bundle of  
dilapidated liomesepun trying to warm

The Contraband&#x27;s Patriotism.  
An elderly colored man, with a very  
philosophical and retrospective cast  
of countenance, was squatting with  
his bundle upon the hurricane deck of  
of one of the Western river steamers,  
toasting his  
shins against thechimney,  
and apparently plunged in a state of  
profound meditation. His dress and  
appearance indicated familiarity  
with camp life, and, it being soon after  
the siege arid capture of Port Donel­  
son, I was inclined to disturb his rever­  
ies, and on interrogation found that  
he had been with the Union forces at  
that place, when I questioned farther.

&quot;Were you in the fightp  
&quot;Had a little taste of it, sah.&quot;  
&quot;Stood your ground, did you?&quot;  
&quot;No, sah, I runs.&quot;

Yes, aah; and I would have gun

&quot;Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sah. Cookin&#x27;s

&quot;Do you consider your life worth more

&quot;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sah.  
&quot;Then you must value it very highly.  
&quot;Yes, sah, I does-more dan all dis
