His announcement to Cushing that he had reluctantly agreed to do so was followed immediately by his announcement of the letters. This juxtaposition may have been more than coincidence, or it may not. All we know of his reasons for sending the correspondence is what he tells us, and that may be interpreted as anything between deception or self-deception at one extreme and the truth at the other. The verdict of history may perhaps be the one that John Dryden gave on another controversial episode:  
Succeeding times did equal folly call  
Believing nothing or believing all.

obscure and perplexed in the extreme ;  
the statements made by the counsel for the  
crown on the trials are not borne out by  
the evidenee; and the witnesses do not  
seem to have been the persons who could  
have given the best information. Still there  
can be no doubt of the existence of this  
atrocious conspiracy, though all the details  
are uncertain. The account given by
