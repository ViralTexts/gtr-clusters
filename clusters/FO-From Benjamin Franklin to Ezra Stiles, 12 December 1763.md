Philada. Dec. 12. 1763  
According to my Promise I send you herewith the Prints copied from Chinese Pictures concerning the Produce of Silk. I fancy the Translator of the Chinese Titles, has sometimes guess’d and mistaken the Design of the Print, in his Account of what is represented in it. But of this you will better judge than I can. I have some Accounts of the Silk in Italy which I will, the first Leisure I have, transcribe and send you. I am with great Esteem, Dear Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant  
B Franklin  
PS. Did I leave with you. Æpinus’s Discourse on the Distribution of Heat over the Earth? If not, I have forgot what I have done with it.

transcribe and send you. Iam with  
  
great Esteem, Dear Sir,  
P.S. Did I leave with Your most obedient  
you Aepinus’s Discourse humble Servant,  
on the Distribution of Heat over B. FRANKLIN.
