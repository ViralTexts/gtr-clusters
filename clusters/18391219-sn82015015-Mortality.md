Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud!    
Like a light-fleeting meteor, a fast-flitting cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and together be laid;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
  
The child whom a mother attended and loved;  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who proved;  
The husband that mother and infant who blest,  
Each, all are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in whose eye  
Shone beauty and pleasure, her triumphs are by;  
And alike from the minds of the living erased,  
Are the mem&#x27;ries of mortals who loved her and praised.  
  
The hand of the King that the sceptre hath borne;  
The brow of the Priest that the mitre hath worn;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The saint who enjoy&#x27;d the communion of Heaven;  
The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven;  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
The herdsman that climb&#x27;d with his goats up the steep;  
The beggar who wander&#x27;d in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the weed  
That wither away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To reap every tale that has often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been,  
We&#x27;ve seen the same sights that our fathers have seen;  
We drink the same stream, and we see the same sun,  
And we run the course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think,  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink,  
To the life we are clinging they also would cling;  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold,  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will come;  
They joyed, but the tongues of their gladness is dumb.  
  
They died!—ah! they died! We things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over each brow,  
That make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
  
&#x27;Tis the wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

MORTALITY.  
  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortals be proud,  
Like a fast flitting meteor, @ fast flying cloud :  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
  
Be scattered around, and together be laid : ,  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
  
The child that a mother attended and loved,  
  
The mother that infant’s affection that proved,  
The husband that mother and infant that blest  
Each — all are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose check ,on whose brow, on whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure, her triumphs are by,  
  
And the memory of tune that loved her and praised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
  
The herdsmen who climbed with his goats to the steep ;  
The beggar that wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass we tread.  
  
The saint that enjoyed the communion of heaven,  
The sinner that dared to remain unforgiven,  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes —like the flower and the weed,  
That wither away to let others succeed ;  
  
So the maltitude comes — even those we behold  
  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
For we are the same things our fathers have been,  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,  
  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,  
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think,  
  
From the death we are shrinking from, they too ‘would  
shrink,  
  
To the life we are clinging to, they too would cling —  
  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold ;  
  
They scorned, bat the heart.of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumber may come,  
They joyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb.  
  
They died, aye they died, and we things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain ;  
  
And the smile, and the tear, and the song, and the dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
  
Tis the twink of an eye, — *tis the draught of a breath  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death ;  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud —  
Ob! why should the spirit of mortals be proud.

MORTALITY.

Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?  
Like a light-flitting meteor, a fast flitting cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and together be laid;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
The child whom a mother atteniled and loved;  
The mother that infan¥’s affection who proved;  
The husband that mother and infant who blest,

We remember, among the first rhythmical fragments of boyish acquisition, a little  
poem, commencing : ‘Oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud?’ — and especially  
  
these two stanzas, which Mr. Dewey may almost be said to have illustrated, in the  
admirable extract which succeeds, although they may doubtless here meet his eye for  
the first time:  
  
‘We are the same things that our fathers have been —  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen;  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,  
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.

POETRY.  
MORTALITY.  
Oh ! why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?  
Like A fast flitting meteor, a fast flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and togetherjbe laid ;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the  
high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
The child, that a mother attended and loved ;  
The mother, that infant’s affection that proved ;  
The husband, that mother and infant that bless’d,  
Each—all are away to their dwelling of rest.  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose  
eye  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are by ;  
And the memory of those that loved her and praised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,  
The eye of the sage, ar d the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap ;  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats to the  
steep;  
The beggar, that wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away—like the grass that we tread.  
The saint, that enjoyed the communion of heaven ;  
The sinner, that dared to remain unforgiven ;  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
So the multitude goes—like the flower and the weed  
That wither away, to let others succeed ;  
So the multitude comes—even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
For we are the same things our fathers have been,  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,  
We drink the same streams, and we feel the same sun,  
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would  
think;  
The death we are shrinking from, they too would  
shrink;  
The life we are clinging to, they too would cling ;  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
They loved—but their story we cannot unfold ;  
They scorned-*but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved —but no wail from their slumbers may  
come;  
They joyed—but the voice of their gladness is dumb.  
They died—ay I they died ; and we things that are  
now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies aver their brow;  
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the changes they met in their pilgrimage road.  
Yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together like sunshine and rain ;  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the  
dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
’Tis the twink of an eye—’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death—  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—  
Oh 1 why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

OH, WHY SHOULD ThE SPIrit oI  
  
MOrTAI  
  
BY PRESIDENT AnrAHAM LInCOLN, oF ILLINOIS.  
  
A correspondent of Zion&#x27;s Advocate (Maine)  
says the following was clipped from a paper print­  
ed there three years ago:  
Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift-fleeing meteor--a fast flying cloud  
A flash of the lightning--a break of the wave  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow will fade  
Be scattered around and together be laid;  
As the young and the old, and the low and the high  
Shall crumble to dust, and together shall lie.  
The infant, a mother attended and loved  
The mother, that infant&#x27;s affections who proved  
The father, that mother and infant who blessed  
Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.  
The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in  
whose eye,  
Shone beauty  
Are the memories of mortals who loved her and  
praised.  
The hand of the King, that the sceptre hath borne  
The brow of the Priest, that the miter hath worn,  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
The herdsman who climbed with his goats up the  
steep;  
The beggar who wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or weed  
That withers away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
For we are the same our fathers have been;  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen;  
We drink the same stream, we see the same sun,  
And run the same course our father&#x27;s have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers did think  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers did  
shrink  
To the life we are clinging our fathers did cling,  
But it speeds from us all like the bird on the wing.  
They loved, but the story we can not unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;  
They grieved--but no wail from their slumber will  
come,  
They joyed,-but the tongue of their gladness is  
dumb.  
They died, ah! they died; we things that are now  
That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
And make in their dwellings a trancient abede,  
Mect the things that they met on their pilgrimage  
road.  
Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain,  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the  
dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
&quot;Tis the wink of an eye,&#x27;tis the draught of a breath  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of  
death;  
From thd guilded saloon to the bier and the shroud;  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

, President  
of the United States. 0! why should the  
spirit of mortal be proud? Like a swift-  
lleeiing meteor, a fust-flying cloud, A  
flush of the lightning, a break of the  
wave, He passeth ironi life to his rest  
in the grave. The leaves of the oak and  
the willow shall fade, Ue scattered  
around, and together be laid; And the  
young and the old, the low and the high,  
Shall crumble to dust and together shall  
lie. Hie infant a mother attended and  
loved; The mother, that inlands  
affection who proved; The father, that  
mother and infant who b!tst— Sach, all  
are away to that dwelling of rest. The  
maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in  
whose evo, Shone beauty and pleasure—her  
tri-Tnphs are by; And alike from the  
minds of the living erased. Are the  
memories of mortals that loved her and  
praised. The hand of the king that the  
sceptre hnth borne; The brow of the  
priest that the mitre hath worn; The eye  
of the sage, nnd the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the  
grave. Tho peasont, whose lot was to sow  
and to reap; The herdsman, who climbed  
with his goats up the steep; The  
begirar, who wandered in search of his  
bread, Have faded away like the grass  
which we tread. So the multitude goes*  
like the flower or the weed, That  
withers awav to let others succeed; So  
the multitude comes* even those we  
behold, To repeat, ever}&#x27; tale iha\ has  
often been told. For we are the same our  
fathers have fceen; We see the same  
sights our fathers have seen; We drink  
the same stream, we see the same sun,  
And run the same course our iath.-rs  
have run. The thoughts we are thinking,  
our fathers did think; From the death we  
are shrinking, our fathers did shrink;  
To the life we are clinging, our fathers  
did cling; But it speeds from us ail,  
iike the bird on the wing. They  
loved—but the story we cannot unfold;  
They scorned—but the heart of the  
haughty &quot;is cold; They grieved—but no  
wail frojs their slumbers will come;  
They joyed—but the tongue of their  
gladness is dumb. They died;&quot;ah! they  
died. We, things that are now— That  
walk-on the turf that lies over their  
brow, And make in their dwelling  
u.transient abode— Meet the thingsj  
thatjthey met on their pilgrimage road.  
Yea. hope and despondency, pleasure and  
pain, Are mingled together in sunshine  
and ratn; And the smile an«i the tear,  
and the song and the dirge,  
StilJ*fol!o\v each other like surge upon  
surge. &#x27;Tis the wink of on eye, &#x27;tis the

mortal be proud

“ O why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?  
Like a fast-flitting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,—  
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
“ The leaves of the oak and the willows shall fade,  
Be scattered around, and together be laid ;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall mou!der to dust, and together shall lie.  
  
“ The child that a mother attended and loved,  
The mother that infant’s affection that proved,  
The husband that mother and infant that blest,  
Each — all are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
“ The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure — her triamphs are by ;  
And the memory of those that beloved her and praised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
  
“The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
“ The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
The herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep,  
The beggar that wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
“ The saint that enjoyed the communion of heaven,  
The sinner that dared to remain unforgiven,  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have guietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
“So the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed  
That wither away to let others succeed ;  
So the multitude comes — even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
| “ For we are the same things that our fathers have been,  
  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen ;  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,  
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.  
  
“The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think,  
  
From the death we are shrinking from they too would  
shrink ;  
  
To the life we are clinging to they too would cling —  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
  
“ They loved—but their story we cannot unfold ;  
They scorned — but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved — but no wail from their slumbers may  
  
come;  
They joyed — but the voice of their gladness is dumb.  
  
“ They died—ay, they died! and we things that are now  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.

The following poem, written by Aboaiiajs Lin­

deep Interest:  
OH I WHY SHOULD THE SPIEIT OF iIOSTAL

Ob, why should the spirit of mortal be proud t  
Like a swift fleeting meteor—a fast flying cloud—  
A Hash of the lightning—&amp; break of the wave—  
He pasacth from life to his rest In the grave.  
  
Tte leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade.  
Be scattered around, and together be laM;  
As tbe young, and tbe old, tbe low and the high.  
Shall crumble to dost and together aboil lie.  
  
Tbe infant a mobter attended and lored—  
Tbo mother. th«t infant&#x27;s affection who proved;  
Tbe father thatmotheraad infant who blest,—  
Each, all are away to that dwelling ol rest.  
The mald.on whose brow, on whose check, tn  
  
whose eye, ■  
Shone beauty and pleasure -her triumphs are by;  
And alike from the minds of the living erased  
Are tbe mem&#x27;nta of mortals who loved her and  
praised.  
  
The band of the King, that the &#x27;center hath borne,  
Tbe brow of the Priest, that the mitre both wore.  
The eye of the Sage, and the heart of the bravo.  
Are hidden and lost m tbe depths of the grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
Tbo herdsman, who climbed with his goats up  
the steep;  
The beggar, who wondered In search of his bread.  
Have laded away like ihe grass that wo troad.‘  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or weed,  
That withers away to let ofliers succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold, -  
To repeat every tale that baa often been told.  
For we are the same our fathers have been;  
■We see the same sights our fathers have seen,

And run the same course our fathers have run.  
The&#x27;thooghts we are thinking our lathers did  
  
FronrUie death we are shrinking our fa&#x27;hsra did  
  
To the life we are clinging our fathers did cling  
But it speeds ftom ns all like the hud on the wing.

They scorned—but the heart of the haughty is  
They grieved—hut no will from their slumbers

A flash of the lightning--a break of the wave­

The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around, and together be laid;

Shone beanty and pleasure--her triumphs are by;  
And alike from the minds of the living erased  
Are the mem&#x27;ries of mortals who loved her and  
praised.  
Ths hand of the King that the scentre hath borne,  
The brow of the Priest; that the mitre hath worn,  
The eye of the Sage, and the heart of the braye,

t LincoLN&#x27;s PAs  
  
VORITE POENI.  
Mr. F. B. Carpenter, the well-known pain­  
ter, has written a note in reference to a  
poem much admired by Mr. Lincoln. He  
says: &quot;I have been urged by several friends  
to send you the enclosed poem, written  
down by myself from Mr. Lincoln&#x27;s lips,  
and although it may not be new to all of  
your readers, the events of the last week  
give it now a peculiar interest. The cir­  
cumstances under which this copy was  
written down are these: I was with the Pre­  
sident alone one evening in his room, dur­  
ing the time I was painting my large picture  
at the White House, last year. He present­  
ly threw aside his pen and papers, and be­  
gan to talk to me of Shakspeare. He sent  
little &quot;Thad,&quot; his son, to the library to bring  
a copy of the plays, and then read to me  
several of his favorite passages, showing  
genuine appreciation of the great poet.  
relapsing into a sadder strain, he laid the  
book aside, and leaning back in his chair,  
said: &quot;There is a poemn which has been a  
great favorite with me for years, which was  
first shown to me when a young man by a  
friend, and which I afterwards saw and cut  
from a newspaper, and iearned by heart. I  
would,&quot; he continued, &quot;give a great deal to  
know who wrote it, but I have never been  
able to ascertain.&quot; Then, half closing his  
eyes, he repeated to me the lines which I  
enclose to you.  
On! Why Should the spirit of Mor  
tal De Iroud.  
Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift, fleeting meteor, a fast-flying  
cloud,  
A flash of lightening, a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall  
fade,  
Be scattered around the toge her be laid;  
And the young and the old, and the low and  
the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall  
lie.  
The infant and mother, attended and loved:  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who prov­  
ed:  
The husband that mother and infant who  
blessed,  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings of  
Rest.  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath  
borne;  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath  
worn;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the  
brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the  
grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to  
reap;  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats  
up the steep;  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his  
bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we  
tread.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the  
weed  
That withers away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we be  
hold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been  
told.  
For we are the same our fathers have been;  
We see the same sights our fathers have  
 seen;  
We drink the same stream and view the  
same sun,  
And run the same course our fathers have  
run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers  
would think,  
From the death we are shrinking our fath­  
ers would shrink;  
To the life we are clinging they also would  
cling;  
But it speeds for us all, like a bird on the  
wing.  
The loved, but the story we cannot unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty  
is cold;  
They grieved, but no wall from their slum­  
will come;  
They joyed, but the tongue of their glad­  
ness is dumb.  
They died, aye! they died; we things that  
are now,  
That walk on the turf that lies over their  
brow,  
And make on their dwellings a transient  
abode,  
Meet the things that they met on their pil  
grimage road.  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure and  
pain,  
We mingle together in sunshine and rain;  
And the smile and the tear, the song and  
the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon  
surge.  
&#x27;Tis the wink of the eye, &#x27;tis the draught of  
a breath,  
From the blossoms of health to the paleness  
of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the

He paseeth from life to his rest in &#x27;the grave:  
  
The leader of tlits&#x27;on&amp; and the ittiflo* shall fade,  
Be scattered arontid, and together be laid;  
As the young and the old; the low and the high;

The infant a mother attended&#x27; and loved--  
The mother; that infant&#x27;s affection who• proted;;  
The father, that mother and infant who blest,--  
Each, all are away to that dwelling of rest:  
  
The maid on, whose brow, on Whose cheek; ht Whose

Shone beaaty arid pleasure—het triamphe ate by;  
And alike from the minds of the living erased&#x27;

The saint whb erjoyed the communion of Heavelt  
The sinner who dared to remain thforgiten,  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have uuietly mingled theit bones in the dust.  
  
So the multithde gum like the flouter or weed,  
That withers away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those We behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
  
For we are the slake our fathers have been;  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen,  
We dtink the same stream, tee see the same sun,  
And run the same course On fathers kave run.

“ There is a poem which has )&gt;eeu a great favorite with  
me for years, which was first shown to me when a young

great deal to know who wrote it, but I have never been

Mr Lincoln&#x27;s Favorite Poem.  
Mr. F. B. Carpenter, the well-known pain­  
ter, has written a note in roference to a poem  
much admired by Mr. Lincoln. He says: &quot;I  
liavo been urged by several friends to send  
you the onelosod poem, written down by  
myself from Mr. Lincoln&#x27;s lips, and although  
it may not be new to all of your readers, the  
events of the last week give it now a peculiar  
iutercst. The ciroumstances under which  
this copy was written down are these: I was  
with the President alone one evening in hie  
room, duriug the time I was painting my  
largo pictures at the White House, last year.  
He presently threw aside his pen and papers,  
nnd began to talk to me of Shakspcare. He  
sent little &quot;Thad,&quot; his son, to the library to  
bring a copy of the plays, and then, read to  
me several of his favorite passages, showing  
genuine appreciation of the great poet. Re­  
lapsing into a sadder strain, he laid the book  
aside, and leaning back in his chair, said:  
&#x27;&#x27;There is a poem which has been a great fu­  
voritc with me for years which was first showu  
to mc when n young man by a friend, and  
which I afterwards saw and cut from a news­  
paper, and learned by heart. I would, he  
continued, give a great deal to know who  
wrote it, but I have never been able to&gt;ascer­  
tain.&quot; Then half closing his eyes he repea­  
ted to mc the lines which I enclose to- you.&quot;  
on! WHY SUot&#x27;LD TtlS SPiniT or &#x27;-&#x27;Vr\L p- pnouo  
Oli, why should the spirit of mortal he proud ?  
Like a swift, fleeing meteor, a fnst-flyiug cloud,  
A flash of the liglitniug, a break of the wave,  
He posscth froiu life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and together be laid ;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the  
high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
The infant and mother, attended and loved ;  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who proved :  
The husband that mother and infant who blesaed,  
Each, all, ire away to their dwellings of Beat.  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne ;  
The brow of the priest that &#x27;he mitre hath worn  
The eve of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap ;  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the  
step:  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread.  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
I So the multitude goes like the flower or the weed  
That withers away to let others succeed ;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
For we are the same our fathers havo been;  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen *  
We drink the same stream and view the same sun,  
Aud run the same course our fathers hare run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would  
think ;  
From the death we are shrinking aur fathen would  
shrink ;  
To the life we are clinging they also would cling;  
But it speeds for us all, like a bird on the wing.  
Thoy loved, but the story we cannot unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is old ;  
They grieved, but no wall from their slumber will  
come; *  
They joyed, but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.  
  
Tliey died, aye they died ; we things that are now.  
That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
And make in their dwellings a transieat abode,  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage  
road-  
Yea ! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain.  
We mingle together in sunshine end rain ;  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge.  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  
  
Tis&#x27; the wink of ansye, &#x27;tit the draught of a breath  
From the bioesom of health to the paleuem of death  
From the glided saloon to the bier and the shroud,  
Ob, why should the eplrit of neorlal be proud !

The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap ;  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the steep;  
Tin- beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the weed  
That withers away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
Lor we are the same our fathers have been ;  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen ;  
We drink the same stream and view the same sun,  
And run the same course our lathers have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think;  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers would  
shrink ;  
To the life we are clinging they also would cling;  
Rut it speeds for us all, like a bird on the wing.  
They loved, but the story we cannot unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumber will  
come;  
They joyed, but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.  
They died—ah!—they died ; wo, things that are now,  
That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
And make, in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the things that they melon their pilgrimage road  
Vi a i hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
We mingle together in sunshine and rain;  
And the smile and the tear the song and the dirge,  
Still ft How each other, like surge upon surge.  
’Tis tlo? wink of an eye, ’ti.s the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud ;  
Oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?

MORTALITY.  
  
Oh ! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift, fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
  
Be scattered around and together be laid ;  
  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust and together ghall lie.  
  
The infant and mother attended and loved ;  
  
The mother that infant’s affection who proved ;  
The husband that mother and infant who blessed—  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.  
  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are by ;  
  
And the memory of those that beloved her and praised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living eraséd,  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne ;  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn ;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap ;  
  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the steep;  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint that enjoyed the communion of heaven ;  
The sinner that dared to remain unforgiven ;  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the weed,  
That withers away to let others succeed ;  
  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
  
To repeat every tale that has often been told,  
  
For we are the same our fathers have been ;  
  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen ;  
We drink the same stream and view the same sun,  
And run the same course our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think ;  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink ;  
To the life we are clinging they also would cling :  
  
But it speeds for us all, like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but the story we can not unfold ;  
  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved, but no wail from that slumber will come;  
They joyed, but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.  
  
They died, ay ! they died : we things that are now,  
  
That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
And make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
  
  
Magdalene.  
  
Yes! hope and despondency, pleasure‘and pain,  
We mingle together in sunshine and rain;  
  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge,  
  
*Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud.  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

They Joyed—but thu tongue of their gladness ia

They died—ah! they died—we mortals that now

A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,

Tike a fast flitting meteor, a fast flyiug cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passetli from life to Ida rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak nnd the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and together be laid—  
And the voung and the old, and the low and the  
high,  
Shall molder to dust and together shall lie.  
The child that a mother attended and loved:  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who proved;  
The husband thatjmptherand infant wuo blest—  
Each, all,are away to their dwellings of rest.  
The maid, on whose cheek, on whose brow, iu whose  
Phone {canty and pleasure—her triumphs are by;  
And the memory of those who loved her and  
praised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
The hand of the king that the scepter hath borne;  
The brow of the priest that the miter hath worn;  
&#x27;Hie eye of the sage and the heart of the brav#,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats to the  
steep;  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
The saint, who enjoyed the communion of heaven;  
The sinner, who dared to remain unforgiven;  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty aud just,  
.Have.quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
Bo the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed,  
That wither away to let others succeed;  
Bo the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
For we are the same things our fathers have been;  
We see the same sights our fathers have seeu;  
&quot;We drink the same stream and feel the same sun,  
And run the same course our fathers have ruu.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would  
think;  
From the death we are shrinking from, they too  
would shrink;  
To the life we are clinging t«&gt;, they too would cling,  
Hut it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will  
come;  
They joyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb.  
They died—ay! they died; we, things that are now,  
&quot;Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow;  
Who make iu their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.  
Yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;  
And the smile and the tear, the song and tue dirge,  
jstill follow each other. like surge upon  
&gt;Tis the twink of an eye, Mis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death;

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a fast-flitting meteor, a fast-flying clond,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave.  
He passeth from life to this rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the bak and the wiljow shall fade,  
Be scattured around and together be laid-  
And the young and the old, and the low and the

Shall moulder to dust and together shall lie  
  
The child that a mother attended and loved  
The mo her that infant&#x27;s affection who proved  
The husband that mother and infant who blest­  
Each, all are away to their dwellings of rest.  
  
The maid, on whose cheek, on whose brow, in  
whose eye,  
Shone beanty and pleasure  
her trlumphs are by  
And the memory of those who loved her and  
praised  
Are alike from the minds of the living crased.  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats to the  
steep;  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint, who enjoyed the communion of heaven  
The sinner, who dared to remain unforgiven  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quletly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower and the

That wither away to let others succeed  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold.  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
For we are the same things our fathers have been  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen;

And the memory of those who loved her and

O, why should the spirit of mortal be prond ?  
Like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
Man passes from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
  
Be scattered around and together be laid,  
  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall die.  
  
The infant, a mother attended and loved ;  
  
The mother, that infant’s affection who proved ;  
The husband, that mother and infant who blessed ;  
Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose  
  
eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are by;  
And the memory of those who loved her en  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne ;  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depth of the grave,  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the  
steep ;  
  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven,  
The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven,  
  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower and weed,  
That wither away to let others succeed ;  
  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been ;  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,  
And run the same course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would  
think ;  
  
From the death we are shrinking, our fathers would  
shrink ;  
  
To the life we are clinging, they also would cling.  
  
But it speeds from us all like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold ;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will  
  
come ;  
They joyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb.  
  
They died—ay! they died; and we things that are  
now  
  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yes hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain ;  
  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  
  
’Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—  
O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?

WHY &#x27;HOULD THE SPIRIT OF MOR­  
TAL BE PROUD ?  
GRAHAM LINCOLN’S FAVORITE POEM.  
O, whshould the spirit of mortal be proud !  
Like swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,  
A of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
Mair asses from life to Im rest in the grave.  
tv* leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around, and together be laid;  
And the young and the old, and the low’and the high  
Eball molder to dust, and together shall lie.  
The Infant a mother attended and loved.  
Hthe mother that Infant’s affection who proved,  
^Bie husband that mother and infant who blessed.  
Mpu u. all, are away to their dwellings of rest.  
Babe maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whosi  
z  
■phone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are by;  
Ra nd the memory of those who loved her or praised  
■Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
■The hand of the king, that the sceptre hath borne,  
B&#x27;i he brow of the priest, that the mitre hath worn,  
■The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
■ Are hidden and lost in the depth of the grave.  
■The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
■The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up thl  
steep,  
■The beggar who wandered in search of his bread,  
&quot;Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
The saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven,  
* The sinner w ho dared to remain unforgiven.  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the w&#x27;eed,  
a hat withers away to let others succeed;  
Jo the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
l’o repeat every tale tliat has often been told. /  
For we are the same our fathers have been :  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen:  
We drink the same stream and view the same sun,  
And run the same course our fathers have run,  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers woulc  
think;  
। From the death we are shrinking our fathers woulc  
shrink;  
To the life we are c’lnging they also would cling—  
■ hit it speeds for us all, like a bird on the wing,  
■phey loved, but the story we cannot unfold ;  
B&#x27;hey scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;

Oh. why should tbe spirit of mortals be proud?  
Like a swift tleellog metaor. a Iwt flying cloud,  
A flub of the lighiuiog. a break of the ware,

Shall moulder to dust nd together ihall lie.  
The Infant a mother attended and loTed,  
The motner that iofa-t affections who proved.  
The husband that mother and Infant who blessed.  
Each, all are away to their dweUngs of rest.  
lbs insld on whose cheek, oa whose .brow, in  
whose eye  
&#x27; Ehoae beauty and pleasure, her triumphs bye,  
And tho memory ol those who loved ber and  
praised .... .  
&#x27; Aie alike from the minds of the living erased.  
The hand of the King that the sceptre hath  
fcorne.  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,  
The eye of the sae and tne heart ef tae brave.  
Are hidden and lost la the depth of the grave.  
The peasant whose &#x27;twas to sow and to reap.  
The herdsman who climbed with his goats to the  
The beirgar who wandered In search of his bread.  
Are faded away like the grass that we tread.

The begstar, who wandered in search of  
his bread.  
Have faded away like the grass that we

The saint who enjoyed the communion  
of heaven,  
The slnuer who dreads to remain nnfor

The wise and the foolish, the guUty and  
111 st.  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the  
dust.  
So the multitude goes, like the flowers or  
the weed,  
That withers away to let others succeed  
So tiie multitude comes, even those we  
behold.  
To repeat every tale that has ever been  
. told.  
For we are the same our fathers have  
been.  
We see the same sights our fathers have  
seen:  
We driuk the same stream, and view the  
same sun.  
And run tbe same course our fathers have  
run.  
Tbe thoughts we are thinking our father:  
would think.  
From the dealii we are shrinking our  
fathers would shrink.  
To the life we are clinging they also  
would dim:.  
But it speeds for us all like a bird on the  
wmg.  
They loved, but the story we cannot un  
fold:  
They scorned, but the heart of the  
hauuhlv is cold;  
They urieved, but no wail from their  
slumbers will come:  
They joyed, but the tongue of their glad  
ness is uuuio.  
They died, ah, they died, and we thing  
that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their  
brow,  
Who make in their dwelling a transient  
alHide,  
Meet the things that tbey met on thtir  
. pilgrimage road.  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure  
auu palu.  
&#x27;ve initiate together in sunshine and rain.  
And the smile and the tear, the song and  
the dirge.  
Still follow each other like surge upon  
surge.  
&#x27;Tis the wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught  
ol a orealh.  
From the olossom of health to the pale-  
-uess of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and  
Hie shroud.  
Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be  
proud

of the finest productions of the English

epirit of mortal be proud ? Like a  
swift-fitting meteor, a fast-flying

around and together be laid ; And tbe  
young and the old, and the low and the

Shone beantv and Dleasare. her triumphs

have loved her and praised, Are alike

borne, The brow of the priest that the

and the heart of the brave, &#x27;l Are  
hidden and lost in the depths of the.

faded away like the grass that we tread.  
The saint who enjoy&#x27;d the communion of

LINCOLN’S FAVORITE POEM.  
  
The following beautiful poem was a par-  
ticular favorite with President Lincoln, who  
often referred to it as one of the finest pro-  
ductions of the English language. It is  
yelated by F. B. Carpenter, the artist, that,  
while engaged in painting Mr. Lincoln’s  
portrait at the White House, the President  
said to him, one evening: ‘“The poem has  
peen a great favorite with me for years. It  
was first shown to me when a young man by  
a friend. The beauty of it at once struck  
me, and I learned it by heart. I would give  
a great deal to know who wrote it, but never  
have been able to ascertain.”]  
  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
  
Like a swift-flitting meteor, a fast-flying  
cloud,  
  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
  
Man passes ifm life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves ‘of the oak and the. willow shall  
fade,  
  
Be scattered around and together be laid;  
  
And the young and the old, and the low and  
the high,  
  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall die.  
  
The child that a mother attended and loved,  
  
The mother that infant’s affection who  
proved,  
  
The husband that mother and infant who  
blessed,  
  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.  
  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow,  
in whose eye,  
  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs  
are by;  
  
And the memory of those who have loved  
her and praised  
  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased. °  
  
The hand of the king that the scepter has  
borne,  
  
The brow of the priest that the miter has  
worn,  
  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the  
brave  
  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the  
grave.  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
  
The herdsman who climbed with his goats  
  
to the steep,  
The beggar who wandered in search of his  
bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint who enjoyed the communion of  
heaven,  
  
The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven,  
  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower and  
the weed,  
  
That wither away to let others succeed;  
  
So the multitude comes, even those we be-  
hold,  
  
To repeat every tale that have often been told.  
  
For we are the same our fathers have been;  
We see the same sights that our fathers have  
  
seen,  
  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the  
same sun,  
  
And run the same course that our fathers  
have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our father’s  
would think;  
  
From the death we are shrinking from they,  
too, would shrink;  
  
To the life we are clinging to they, too,  
would cling;  
  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on  
the wing.  
  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold;  
  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty  
is cold;  
  
They grieved, but no wail from their slum-  
bers will come,  
  
They joyed, but the voice of their gladness  
is dumb.  
  
They died—ay, they died! and we things that

age road. .  
  
Yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and

And the smile and the tear, the song and the  
dirge,  
  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
  
Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a  
breath,  
  
From the blossom of health to the paleness  
of death,  
  
From the gilded salon to the bier and the  
shroud—  
  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

 Spirit sf Mortal  
be Proud ?&quot; President Lincoln&#x27;s  
Favorite Poem.  
Oh, why should the Bpirit of mortal be  
proud?  
Like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying  
cloud,  
A flash o: t he lightning, a break of a wave,  
Man pasiKetli from life to his rest in the  
grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow  
shall fade,  
lie wattereii around and together be laid,  
And the young and the old and the low  
ami the high,  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall  
lie.  
The infant a mother attended and loved ;  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affections who  
proved ;  
The bus Hand that mother and infant who  
blest,  
Each, all are away to their dwellings of  
rest.  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose  
brow, in whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure her triumphs  
are by ;  
And the memory of those who loved her  
and praised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living  
erased.  
The band of the king that the sceptre  
hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath  
worn ;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of tho  
&quot;brave,  
Are hidden and loet in the depth of the  
grave.  
Hie saint who enjoyed the coniuiuniou  
of heaven,  
The sinner who dared to remain unfor­  
given, The wise and the foolish, the guilty and  
just,  
Have quiet Iv mingled their bones in the  
dust.&quot;  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or  
the weed,  
That withers away to let others ev.ceeed ;  
So the multitude comes, even those we  
behold,  
To repeat everv tale that has&quot;, often been  
told.  
For we ore the same our fathers have  
been,  
We see the same sights our fathers have  
seen.  
We drink the same stream and view the  
same sun,  
And run the same course our fathers  
have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers  
would think ;  
From the death we are shrinking, our  
fathers would shrink.  
le life&quot; we  
also cling :  
But it sjieeds for ns all like a bird on the  
wing.  
Thev loved, but the storv we cannot un­  
&#x27; fold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haugh­  
ty is cold ;  
They grieved, but no wail from their  
slumbers will come ;  
They joyed, but the tongue of their glad­  
ness is numb.  
They died, ay ! they died ; and we tilings  
that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their  
brow,  
Wlio make in their dwellings a transient  
aitode,  
Meet the things that they met on their  
pilgrimage road.  
Yea &#x27;. hope and despondency, pleasure and  
pain,  
We mingle together in sunshine and  
rain ;  
And the smiles and the tears, the song  
and the dirge,  
Will follow each other, like surge upon  
surge.  
&#x27;lis the wink oi an eye, &#x27;tis the draught  
of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the pale­  
ness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and  
the shroud  
Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be  
proud?

Shone beauty and pleasure, her triumphs

loved her and praised Are alike from the

the king that the sceptre hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the mitre  
hath worn, The eye of the sage, and

peasant whose lot was to sow and to

faded away like the grass that we tread.  
The saint who enjoyed the communion of  
beayen, The sinner who dared to remain  
unforgiven, The wise and the foolish,  
the guilty and just, Have quietly  
mingled their bones in the dust. So the  
multitude goes, like the flower and the

The thoughts wa are thinking our fathers

To the life we are clinging to they,

Selected Poetry. LINCOLN&#x27;S FAVOURITE  
POEM. The following beautiful poem was a  
particular favourite with President  
Lincoln, who often referred to it as ooe  
of the finest productions of the English  
language. Oh ! why should the spirit of  
mortal be proud ? Like a swift-flitting  
meteor, a fast-flying cloud, A flash of  
the lightning, a break of the wave, Man  
passes from life to his rest in the  
grave. The leaves of the oak and the  
willow shall fade, B-- scattered around  
and logether be laid ; And the young man  
and the old, and the low and the high.  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall  
die. The cU&#x27;d tbat a mother attended and  
loved, The mother that infant&#x27;s  
affection who proved, The husband that  
mother and infant who blessed, Each,  
all, are away to their dwelling of rest.  
The maid on whose check, on whose brow,  
in whose eye. Shone beauty and pleasure,  
her triumphs are by; And the memory of  
those who have loved her and praised Axe  
alike from the minds of the living  
erased. The hand of the king that the  
sceptre hath borne, The brow of the  
priest that the mitre hath worn, The eye  
of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the  
grave. The peasant who wandered in  
search of his bread, Have faded away  
like the grass that we tread. The saint  
who enjoyed the communion of heaven. The  
sinner who dared to remain unforgiven,  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and  
just. Have quietly mingled their bones  
in the dust So the multitude goes, like  
the flower and the weed, That wither  
away to let others succeed ; So the  
multitude comes, even those we behold.  
To repeat every tale that has .often  
been told. For we are the same as our  
fathers have been ; We see the same  
sights that our fathers have seen. We  
drink the same stieam, and we feel the  
same sun. And we ran the same course  
that our fathers have run. The thoughts  
we are thinking our fathers would think  
; From the death we are shrinking from  
they, too, would shrink ; To the life we  
are clinging to they, too, would cling ;  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird  
on the wing. They loved, but their story  
we cannot unfold ; They scorned, but the  
heart of the hauehtv is cold; * Y They  
grieved, but no wail from their slumbers  
will come ; They joyed, but the voice of  
their gladness is dumb. They died — ly !  
they diad ; and we things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over  
their brow. Who made in their dwellings  
a transient abode. Meet the changes they  
met on the pilgrimage road. Yea, hope  
and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and  
rain ; And the smiles and the tear, toe  
song and the dirge, Still follow each  
other like surge upon surge. &#x27;Tis the  
wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught of a  
breath, From the blossom of health to  
the paleness of death, From the gilded  
saloon to the bier and the shroud — Oh !  
why should the spirit of mortal be proud  
?

T LINCOLN I.OVi:i.  
&quot;There is a poem,&quot; said Mr. Lincoln,  
&quot;which has been a great favorite with  
me for years, which was first shown me  
when a voung man by a friend, ami  
which I afterwards saw ami cut from a

would give a good tleal to know who  
wrote it, but I never have been able to  
ascertain.&quot; I hen, half closing his eyes,  
he repeated the verses:  
Oh! why shou Id the spiiit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift flitting meteor, a fast flying cloud,  
The flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
He scattered r round nd together be laid;  
And the young and the old and the low and the  
high  
Shall molder to dust and together shall lie.  
The infant a mother attended and loved,  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who proved.  
The husband that mother and infants who blest,  
Each, all are away to their dwellings of rest.  
The maid on whose check, on whose brow, in  
whose eye,  
Shone beautyand pleasure her triumphs are by;  
And the mem&#x27;ry of those who loved her and  
praised  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
The hand of the king that the scepter hath borne,

So the niuhituJ got like the flower or the weed  
That withers away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those e behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been;  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen;  
We drink the same streams and view the same  
sun  
And run the same course our fathsrs have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would

O WHY SHOULD THE SPIRIT OF  
MORTAL BE PROUD?  
  
PRESIDENT LINCOLN’S FAVORITE POEM.  
O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a fast-flitting meteor, a swift-flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
Man passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
  
Be scatter’d around, and together be laid:  
  
And the young and the old, and the low and the  
high,  
  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall lie.  
  
The infant a mother attended and loved,  
  
The mother that infant’s affection who proved,  
  
The husband that mother and infant who  
blessed—  
  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.  
  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in  
whose eye,  
  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are  
by:  
  
And the memory of those who loved her and  
praised,  
  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath  
borne,  
  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,  
  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
  
The herdsman who climb’d with his goats up  
the steep,  
  
The beggar who wandered in search of his  
bread,  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint who enjoyed the communion of  
heaven,  
  
The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven,  
  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower and the  
weed,  
  
That wither away to let others succeed ;  
  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold  
  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been,  
  
We see the same sights our fathers have seen;  
  
We drink the same stream, and view the same  
sun,  
  
And run the same course that our fathers have  
run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would  
think ;  
  
From the death we are shrinking from, they too  
would shrink ;  
  
To the life we are clinging to, they, too, would  
cling ;  
  
But it speeds from the earth, like a bird on the  
wing.  
  
They loved, but that story we cannot unfold ;  
They scorn’d, but the heart of the haughty is  
cold  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers  
  
will come ;  
They joy’d, but the voice of their gladness is  
dumb.  
  
They died—ay! they died; and we things that  
are now,  
  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
Who make in their dwelling a transient abode,  
  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage  
road.  
  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain  
  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain,  
  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the  
dirge,  
  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  
  
’Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a  
breath,  
  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of  
death,  
  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the  
shroud—  
  
O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

Oh why should the spirit of mortal  
be  
proud?  
Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-  
flving cloud,  
A flash of the lightening, a break of  
the wave,  
Man passes from life to his rest in the  
grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow  
will fade.  
Be scattered around and together be  
laid;  
And the joung and the old, and the low  
and the high.  
Shall moulder to duet and together  
shall lie.  
The infant a mother attended and loved,  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affected who  
proved;  
The husband thai mother and infant  
who bieseed.  
Each, all, are a war to their dwellings  
of rest.  
The maid on whose oheek, on whose  
brow, in whose eve  
Show beauty and pleasure her tri-  
umphs are by;  
And the memory of those who loved  
her and praised.  
Are alike from the minds of the liv  
ing erased.  
The hand of the king that the sceptre  
hath borne.  
The brow of the priest that the mitre  
hath worn.  
The eye of the sage and the heart of  
the brave.  
Are hidden and lost in the depth of  
the grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and  
to reap.  
The heardsman. who climed with his  
goats up the steep.  
The beggar, who wandered in search of  
his bread.  
Have faded away like the grass that  
we tread.  
The saint who enjoyed the communion  
of heayen.  
The sinner who dared to remain un  
forgiven.  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty  
and just.  
Have quietly mingled their bones in  
the dust.  
80 the multitude goes, like the flowers  
or the weed  
That withers away to let others suc­  
ceed.So the multitude comes, even those we  
behold.  
To repeat every tale that has often  
been told.  
For we are the same  
ur fathers have  
been:  
We see the same sights  
our fathers  
nave seen  
We drink the same stream and vie  
the same sun.  
And run the same course our fathers  
have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fath­  
ers would think.  
From the death we are shrinking our  
fathers would shrink.  
To the life we are clinging they also  
would ding.  
But it speeds for us all, like a bird  
on the wing.  
They loved, but

They scorned, but the  
heart of the  
haughty is cold:  
They grieved, but no wail  
from their  
slumbers will come,  
They joyed, but the tongue  
of their  
gladness is dumb.  
They died, aye! they died, and we things  
that are now.  
Who walk on the turf that lies over  
their brow.  
Who make in their dwellings a tran­

Meet the things that they met on their  
pilgrimage road.  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure

We mingle together in sunshine and

A flash of the lightning, a break of the  
wave, a  
Man passes from life to his rest in the  
grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow  
shall fa&#x27;le,  
Be scattered around and together be  
la’d;  
And the young and the old, the low and  
the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together  
shall lie.  
The infant a mother attended and loved  
The mother, that infant&#x27;s affection who  
proved,  
The father, that mother and infant who  
blessed,  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings  
of rest.  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose  
brow, in whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her tri­  
  
umphs are by;  
And the memory of those who loved  
her and piaised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living  
erased.  
The hand of the King that the scepter  
hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the mitre  
hath worn,  
The eye of th sage and the heart of the  
brave,  
Are hidden and lost in depth of the  
grave.  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and  
to reap,  
The herdsman, who climbed with his  
goatB up the steep.  
The beggar, who wandered in search of  
bis bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we  
tread.  
The saint who enjoyed the communion  
of heaven,  
The sinner who who dared to remain  
unforgiven,  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and  
and just.  
Have quietly mingled their bones in  
the dust.  
So the multitude goes, like the flowers  
or the weed,  
That withers away.to let othessucceed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we  
behold.  
To repeat every tale that has often been  
told.  
For we are the same our fathers have  
been;  
We see the same sights our fathers have  
seen;  
We drink the same stream and view the  
same sun.  
And rtiu the same course our fathers  
have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fath­  
er would think,  
From the death we aro shrinking our  
fathers would shrink:  
To the life we are clingiug they also  
would cliog;  
But it speeds for us all, like a bird on  
the wing.  
They loved, but the story we cannot  
unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the  
haughty is cold;  
They grieved, but no wail from their  
slumbers will come;  
They joyed but the tongue of their glad­  
ness is dumb.  
  
They died, aye! they died; and we  
things that are now.  
Who walk on the turf that lies over  
their brow.  
Who make in their dwellings a transi­  
ent abode,  
Meet the i hinge that they met on their  
pilgrimage road.  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure  
and pain,  
We mingle together in sunshine and  
rain;  
And the smiles and the tears, the song  
and the dirge.  
Still follow each other, like surge upon  
surge.  
Tis the wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught  
of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the pale­  
ness of death, -v.  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and  
the shroud.  
Oh, why should the spirit of mortal  
be proud?

Oh. why should the spirit of mortal be  
proud?  
Like a sw’ift, fleeting meteor, a fast fly­  
ing cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the  
  
wave,  
Man passeth from life to his rest in the  
grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow  
shall fade.  
Be scattered around and together be  
laid;  
And the young and the old, and the  
low and the high.  
Shall moulder to dust and together  
shall lie.  
  
The infdnt a mother attended and  
loved;  
The mother that infant’s affection who  
proved;  
The husband that mother and infant  
who blessed,  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings  
of rest.  
  
The maid, on whose cheek, on whose  
brow, in whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her tri­  
umphs are by;  
And the memo-y of those who loved  
her and praised.  
Are alike from the minds of the living  
erased.  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre  
hath borne;  
The brow of the priest that the mitre  
hath worn;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of  
the brave.  
Are hidden and lost in the depth of the  
grave.  
  
The peasant whose lot to sow and to  
reap;  
The herdsman, who climbed with his  
goats up the steep;  
The beggar, who wandered in seach of  
his bread.  
Have faded away like the grass that  
we tread.  
  
The saint who enjoyed the communion  
of heaven.  
The sinner who dared to remain unfor­  
given.  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty  
and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in

So the multitude goes, like the flowers

behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often  
been told.

We drink the same stream and view

And run the same course our fathers

0, Why Should the Spirit of Mortal  
he Proud?  
  
The following poem was a particular  
favorite with Mr. Lincoln. Mr. F. B.  
Carpenter, the artist, writes that, while  
engaged in painting his picture at the  
White House, he was alone one even­  
ing with the president in his room,  
when he said : &quot;There is a poem which  
has been a great iavorite with me for  
years, which was first shown to me  
when a young man by a friend, and  
which I afterwards saw, and cut from  
a newspaper and learned by heart. 1  
would,&quot; he continued, &quot;give a great  
deal to know who wrote it, but have  
never been able to ascertain.&quot;  
O why should the spirit of mortal be  
proud?  
Like a swift-fleeting meteor, afast-flying  
cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the  
wave,  
Man passes from life to his rest in&#x27;the  
grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow  
shall fade,
