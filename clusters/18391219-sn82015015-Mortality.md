Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud!    
Like a light-fleeting meteor, a fast-flitting cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and together be laid;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
  
The child whom a mother attended and loved;  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who proved;  
The husband that mother and infant who blest,  
Each, all are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in whose eye  
Shone beauty and pleasure, her triumphs are by;  
And alike from the minds of the living erased,  
Are the mem&#x27;ries of mortals who loved her and praised.  
  
The hand of the King that the sceptre hath borne;  
The brow of the Priest that the mitre hath worn;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The saint who enjoy&#x27;d the communion of Heaven;  
The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven;  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
The herdsman that climb&#x27;d with his goats up the steep;  
The beggar who wander&#x27;d in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the weed  
That wither away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To reap every tale that has often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been,  
We&#x27;ve seen the same sights that our fathers have seen;  
We drink the same stream, and we see the same sun,  
And we run the course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think,  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink,  
To the life we are clinging they also would cling;  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold,  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will come;  
They joyed, but the tongues of their gladness is dumb.  
  
They died!—ah! they died! We things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over each brow,  
That make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
  
&#x27;Tis the wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

For we are the same things that our f others have

We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same

And we run the same course that our fathers have

Flic thoughts we ate thinking our fathers would  
think.  
From the death we are shrinking from, they too  
would shrink,  
To the life we arc clinging to, they too would

But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the

On ! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a fast-flitting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,  
A fiash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passes from life to his rest in the grave !  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
  
Be scatter’d around, and together be laid ;  
  
And the young, and the old, and the low, and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie  
  
The child that a mother atténded and loved,  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection that proved,  
The husband ‘iat mother and infant that blest—  
Each, all are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye  
Shone beauty and pleasure, her triumphs are by ;  
  
And the memory of those that beloved her and praise d  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
  
The hand of the king, that the sceptre hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave.  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave,  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
  
The herdsman who climb’d with his goats to the steep,  
The beggar that wander’d in search of his bread,  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint that enjoy’d the communion of Heaven,  
The sinner that dared to remain unforgiven,  
  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed,  
That wither away to let others succeed ;  
  
So the multitude comes— even there we behold,  
  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
  
  
For we are the same things that our fathers have been,  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen;  
  
We drink the same streams, and we feel the same sun,  
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think ;  
  
From the death we are shrinking from, they too would shrink ;  
To the life we are clinging to, they too would cling—  
  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved—but their story we cannot unfold ;  
  
They scorn’d—but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
  
They grieved—but no wail from their slumbers may come ;  
They joy’d—but the voice of their gladness is dumb,  
  
They died—ay, they died! and we things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together like sunshine and rain ;  
  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
  
Tis the twink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud ;—

MORTALITY.  
  
So the multitude goes—like the flower and the weed,  
That wither away to let others succeed ;  
  
So the multitude comes—even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
We are the same things that our fathers have been,  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen ;  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,  
  
And we run the same course that our fathers have  
run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think;  
  
From the death we are shrinking from, they too  
would shrink;  
  
To the life we are clinging to, they too would cling—  
  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved—but their story we cannot unfold ;  
They scorned—but the heart of the haughty is cold;  
They grieved—but no wail from their slumbers may  
come;  
They joyed—but the voice of their gladness isdumb.  
  
They died—ay, they died ! and we things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
Who walk in their dwellings, a transient abode,  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together like sunshine and rain;  
  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
  
*Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the palenessof death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—  
Oh why should the spirit of mortals be proud

Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?  
Like a fast flitting meteor, a fast flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passes from life, to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak, and tke willow may fade,  
  
Be scattered around, and together be laid,  
  
And the young and the old, and the low, and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall lie.  
  
The child whom a mother attended and loved,  
The mother that infant’s affection who proved,  
The husband that mother and infant who blest,  
Each, all, are away to the dwelling of rest.  
  
| The maid on whose cheek, on whdse brow, in whose  
  
eye,  
  
Shone Senet, and pleasure—her triumphs were high,  
  
And the memory*of those who have loved her, and  
praised,  
  
Are alike from the mind of the living erased.  
  
The hand of the king, that the sceptre hath borne,  
The brow of the priest, that the mitre hath worn,  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats to the  
steep;  
  
The beggar that wandered in search of his bread,  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint, that enjoyed the communion of Heaven ;  
The sinner, that died with his sins unforgiven ;  
The wise, and the foolish, the guilty, and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones with the dust.  
  
  
  
FRIENDS’ INTELLIGENCER.  
  
So the multitude go, the flower and the weed,  
That wither away, to let others succeed ;  
  
So the multitude comes, who are those we behold,

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?  
Like a swift flitting meteor—a fast flying cloud—  
A flash of the lightning—a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow will fade,  
  
Be scattered around and together be laid ;  
  
So the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall crumble to dust and together shall lie.  
  
The infant a mother attended and loved ;  
  
The mother, that infant’s affection who proved ;  
The father, that mother and infant who blessed ;  
Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in whose  
eye,  
  
Shone beauty and pleasure,—her triumphs are by ;  
  
And alike from the minds of the living erased  
  
Are the memories of mortals who loved her and  
praised.  
  
The hand of the king, that the sceptre hath borne ;  
The head of the priest, that the mitre hath worn;  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the  
steep ;  
  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread ;  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint, that enjoyed the communion of heaven ;  
The sinner, that dared to remain unforgiven ;  
  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude go, like the flower and the weed  
That wither away to let others succeed :  
  
So the multitude come, even those we behold,  
  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been:  
  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen:  
We drink the same stream—we see the same sun—  
We run the same course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers did think;  
  
From the death that we shrink from, our fathers did  
shrink:  
  
To the life that we cling to, our fathers did cling ;  
  
But it speeds from us all, like the bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but the story we cannot unfold ;  
  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold :  
  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers can  
come ;  
  
They joyed, but the tongue of theirgladness is dumb.  
  
They died—ah! they died ; we, the things that are  
now,

And make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage  
road.  
  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift, fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest, in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around, and together be laid ;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the  
high,  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall lie.  
The infant a mother attended and loved ;  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who proved ;  
The husband that mother and infant who blessed,  
Each, all, are away to tboir dwellings of Rest.  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne:  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn :  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,

Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be prond ?  
  
Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,  
  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
  
Man passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow may fade,  
  
Be seattered around, and together be laid ;  
  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
  
The infant a mother attended and loved ;  
  
The mother that infant’s affection who proved ;  
  
The husband, that mother and infant who blest,—  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.  
  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure, —her triumphs are by ;  
  
And the memory of those who loved her and praised,  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne,  
  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,  
  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the steep,  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint, who enjoyed the communion of Heaven,  
  
The sinner, who dared to remain unforgiven,  
  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
or the weed  
  
rs succeed 4  
  
So the multitude goes—like the flower  
That withers away to let oth  
So the multitude comes—even those we behold,  
  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been ;  
  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen ;  
  
We drink the same stream, and we view the same sun.  
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think :  
From the death we are shrinking,our fathers would shrink:  
To the life we are clinging, they also would cling ;—  
  
But it speeds from us all like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved—but the story we cannot unfold ;  
  
The y scorned—but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved—t from their slumber willcome:  
They joye d—but the tong iness is dumb.  
  
ut no wail  
of their gladn  
They died—ay, they died ;—and we things that are now;  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
And make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
  
We mingle together in sunshine and rain ;  
  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge  
  
°T is the wink of an eye—’tis the draught of a breath—  
From the blossom of healt! to the paleness of lke ith,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud :—  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

* This poem was written by a young  
Scotchman, a contemporary of Sir Walter  
Scott. He died in Edinburgh, in 1825, when  
only thirty-six years O6fage. It was the fa-  
vorite poem of President Lincoln, who often  
repeated it with deep feeling, and the spirit  
that pervades it no doubt influenced in some  
degree the life of that great but strangely  
humble man.

why should the spirit of mortal be proud  
? Like a swift, fleeting meteor, a fast-  
flying eloud, A flash of the liehtnine,  
a break of the wave, He passeth from  
life to his rest in the grave. The  
leaves of the oak and willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and together be laid  
; And&#x27;the young and the old, and the low  
and the high Shall moulder to dust and  
together shall lie. The infant and  
mother attended and loved ; The mother  
that infant&#x27;s affection who proved, The  
husbahd/th*t mother and infant who  
blessed,&#x27; Each, all, are away to their  
dwellings of- rest. » The hand of the  
king that the sceptre hath borne ? The  
brow of the priest that the mitre hath  
worn ; The eye of. the Bage&#x27;and the  
heart of the brave, Are hidden and lost  
in the depths of the grave. The peasant,  
whose lot was to sow and to reap y The  
herdsman who climbed with his goats up

the weed ? . That withers awav to let  
others succeed ; _ . . So the multitude  
comes, even those wo behold, To repeat  
every tale that lias often been told.  
For we are the same our fathers have  
been ; And see the same sights our  
fathers havo seen ; We drink the -same  
stream and view the same sun, . And run  
the same course our fatheas have run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers  
would think; . From the deaths we are  
shrinking our fathers would shrink ; To  
the life we are clinginR they also would  
cling ; But it speeds for us all like a  
bird on the wing. They loved, but the  
story wo cannot unfold ; They scorned,  
but the heart of the haughty is&#x27; &#x27; cold  
; : They grieved, but no wail from their  
slumber will come ; 1 They joyed, but  
the tongue of their gladness is dumb.  
Thej died, aye ! they died ; we things  
that are now. . . ? That walk on the

in their dwellings a transient abode.  
Meet the things that they met on their

And the smile and the tear, and the song

The Saint-who enjoyed his communion with heaven,  
The Sinner who dared to remain unforgiven.  
The Wise and the Foolish, the Guilty and Just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed,  
Each withers away to let succeed ;  
So the multitude comes, even this we behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
For we’re the same things that our fathers have  
been,  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun.  
And we run the same course which our fathers have  
run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers did think,  
From the death we arc shrinking they also did  
shrink,  
To the life we are clinging they also did cling,  
But it sped, and now speeds, like a cl#ud on the  
wing.  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold,  
They scorned, but the lip of the haughty is cold,  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumber may  
come.  
They joyed, but the noise of their gladness is done*  
They died; ah! they died, and we things that are  
now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies oyer their brow.  
But we make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the changes they met on the pilgrim’s high  
road. *  
We weep and despond, midst its pleasure and pain  
And we mingle together in sunshine and rain,  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  
’Tis the wink of the ’tis the draught of the  
breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud ;

Yes hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain ;  
  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  
  
’Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—

Oh. why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flylug eloml.  
A Hash of the lightning a break of the wave,

Tiie maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in

Shone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are

They sconwd, hut the heart of the haughty Is

They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers

laneuaee : — Oh - why should the spirit  
of mortal be proud? Like a swift-fitting  
meteor, a fast- flying cloud, A flash of  
the lightning, a break of the wave, Man  
passes from life to h»s rest in the  
grave. The leaves of the oak and the  
willow shall fade, Be scatter&#x27;d around  
and together be laid ; And the young and  
the old and the low and the high, Shall  
moulder to dust and together shall die.  
The child that a mother attended and  
loved, Tiie mother that infant&#x27;s  
affections who proved, The husband that  
mother and infant who blessed, TVIi,  
all, are away to their dwellings of  
rest. The maid on whose cheek, on whose  
brow, in whose eye, Shone beauty and  
pleasure, her triumphs are by; And the  
memory of those who have loved her and  
praised, Are alike from the minds of the  
living erased. The hand of the king that  
the sceptre hath borne, The brow of the  
priest that the mitre hath worn, The eye  
of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the  
grave. The peasant whose lot was to sow  
and to reap, The herdsman who climb&#x27;d  
with his goats to the steep, The beggar  
who wander&#x27;d in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we  
tread. The saint who enjoy&#x27;d the  
communion of heaven, The sinner who  
dared to remain unforgiven, The wise and  
the foolish, the guilty and just, Have  
quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower  
and the weed, That wither away to let  
others succeed ; So the multitude comes,  
even those we behold, To repeat every  
tale that has often been told. For we  
are the same that our fathers have been  
; We see the same sights that our  
fathers have seen. We drink the same  
stream, and we feel the same sun, And  
run the same course that our fathers  
have run. The thoughts we are thinking  
our fathers would think ; From the death  
we are shrinking from, they, too, would  
shrink ; To the life we are clinging to,  
they, too, would cling; But it speeds  
from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
They loved, but their story we cannot  
unfold ; They scorned, but the heart of  
the haughty is cold; They grieved, but  
no wail from their slumbers will come ;  
They joy&#x27;d but the voice of their  
gladness is ;. dumb. They died — ay !  
they died ; and we things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over  
their brow, Who make in their dwellings  
a transient abode, Meet the changes they  
met on their pilgrimage road. Yea, hope  
and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and  
rain ; And the smile and the tear, the  
song and the dirge, Still follow each  
other like surge upon surge. &#x27;Tis the  
wink of the eye,J*tis the draught of a  
breath, From the blossom of health to  
the paleness of death, From the gilded  
saloon to the bier and the shroud — Oh !  
why should the spirit of mortal be proud

language. Oh ! why should the spirit of  
mortal be proud ? Like a swift-flitting  
meteor, a fast-flying cloud, A flash of  
the lightning, a break of the wave, Man  
passes from life to his rest in the  
grave. The leaves of the oak and the  
willow shall fade, B-- scattered around  
and logether be laid ; And the young man  
and the old, and the low and the high.  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall  
die. The cU&#x27;d tbat a mother attended and  
loved, The mother that infant&#x27;s  
affection who proved, The husband that  
mother and infant who blessed, Each,  
all, are away to their dwelling of rest.  
The maid on whose check, on whose brow,  
in whose eye. Shone beauty and pleasure,  
her triumphs are by; And the memory of  
those who have loved her and praised Axe  
alike from the minds of the living  
erased. The hand of the king that the  
sceptre hath borne, The brow of the  
priest that the mitre hath worn, The eye  
of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the  
grave. The peasant who wandered in  
search of his bread, Have faded away  
like the grass that we tread. The saint  
who enjoyed the communion of heaven. The  
sinner who dared to remain unforgiven,  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and  
just. Have quietly mingled their bones  
in the dust So the multitude goes, like  
the flower and the weed, That wither  
away to let others succeed ; So the  
multitude comes, even those we behold.  
To repeat every tale that has .often  
been told. For we are the same as our  
fathers have been ; We see the same  
sights that our fathers have seen. We  
drink the same stieam, and we feel the  
same sun. And we ran the same course  
that our fathers have run. The thoughts  
we are thinking our fathers would think  
; From the death we are shrinking from  
they, too, would shrink ; To the life we  
are clinging to they, too, would cling ;  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird  
on the wing. They loved, but their story  
we cannot unfold ; They scorned, but the  
heart of the hauehtv is cold; * Y They  
grieved, but no wail from their slumbers  
will come ; They joyed, but the voice of  
their gladness is dumb. They died — ly !  
they diad ; and we things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over  
their brow. Who made in their dwellings  
a transient abode. Meet the changes they  
met on the pilgrimage road. Yea, hope  
and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and  
rain ; And the smiles and the tear, toe  
song and the dirge, Still follow each  
other like surge upon surge. &#x27;Tis the  
wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught of a  
breath, From the blossom of health to  
the paleness of death, From the gilded  
saloon to the bier and the shroud — Oh !  
why should the spirit of mortal be proud

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying  
cloud?  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave.  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fado,  
Be scattered around and together be laid,  
And the young, and the old, and the low, and  
the high  
Shall molder to dust and together shall lio.  
The infant a mother attended and loved,  
The mother that &quot;infant &#x27;s affection who proved,  
The husband that mother and Infant who  
blessed,  
Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.  
The hand of the king that the scepter hath  
borne.  
The brow of tho priest that tho miter hath  
worn,  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap ;  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats to  
tho steep ;  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his  
bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the  
weed  
Thut withers away to let othors succeed.  
So the multitudo comes, even those wo behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
For we are the same our fathers have been  
Wo soo the same sights our fathers have seen,  
We drink the same Htream and view tho samo  
sun  
And run the same course our fathers havo run.  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers  
would think,  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers  
would shrink,  
To tho life wo aro clinging they also would  
cling,  
But it speeds from us all, like a bird on the  
wing.  
They loved, but the story we cannot unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is  
cold;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumber  
will come ;  
They Joyed ; but tho tonguo of their gladness  
is dumb.  
They died aye, they died and we things that  
are now,  
TLnt walk on the turf that lies over their brow  
And make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the things that they met on their pil  
grimage road.  
Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
W13 mingle together in sunshine and rain,  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the  
dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.

We drink the same stream, and we  
view the same sun,  
And ran tho same course that our  
fathers have run.  
Tho thoughts we aro thinking, our  
fathers would think;  
From the death that we shrink from  
our fathers shrink;  
To the life that wo cling to, tbey  
also would cling,  
Bat it speeds for us all, like a bird

They seemed, but the heart of the
