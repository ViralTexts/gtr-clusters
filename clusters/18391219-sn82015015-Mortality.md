Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud!    
Like a light-fleeting meteor, a fast-flitting cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
Be scattered around and together be laid;  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.  
  
The child whom a mother attended and loved;  
The mother that infant&#x27;s affection who proved;  
The husband that mother and infant who blest,  
Each, all are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in whose eye  
Shone beauty and pleasure, her triumphs are by;  
And alike from the minds of the living erased,  
Are the mem&#x27;ries of mortals who loved her and praised.  
  
The hand of the King that the sceptre hath borne;  
The brow of the Priest that the mitre hath worn;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
  
The saint who enjoy&#x27;d the communion of Heaven;  
The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven;  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap;  
The herdsman that climb&#x27;d with his goats up the steep;  
The beggar who wander&#x27;d in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or the weed  
That wither away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To reap every tale that has often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been,  
We&#x27;ve seen the same sights that our fathers have seen;  
We drink the same stream, and we see the same sun,  
And we run the course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think,  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink,  
To the life we are clinging they also would cling;  
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold,  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will come;  
They joyed, but the tongues of their gladness is dumb.  
  
They died!—ah! they died! We things that are now,  
Who walk on the turf that lies over each brow,  
That make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
  
&#x27;Tis the wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—  
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

Oh, why should the ppirit of mortal be proud?  
Like a swift fleeting meteor—a fast flying cloud —  
A flash of the lightning—a break of ilia wave—  
He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.  
The leaves of the oak and the willow will fade,  
Be scattered around, and together be laid;  
As the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall crumble to dust, and together shall lie.  
The infant a mother attended and loved—  
The mother, that infant&#x27;s affection who proved;  
The lather, that mother and infant who blessed—  
Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest. ,  
The maid on whose brow,on whose cheek, in whose o^e,  
ShonQ beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are by;  
And alike from the minds of the living erased  
Are the memories of mortals who loved her and praised.  
The hand of the Kihg, that the sceptre hath borne,  
The brow of the Priest, that the mitre hath worn.  
The eye cf the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.  
The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap:  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up thesteep;  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
So the multitude goes, like the flower or weed  
That withers away to let others succeed,  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that has often been told.  
For we are the same that our fathers have been;  
We see the same sights our fathers huve seen;  
We drink the same stream, we see the same sun;  
And run the same course our fathers have run.  
Tne thoughts we are thinking our fathers did think;  
From the death we are shrinking our fathers did shrink;  
To the life we are clinging our fathers did cling,

They loved, but the story we eanuot unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;  
They grieved, but no wad from their slumbers will come:  
They joyed, but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.  
They died—ah! they died;—we, tilings that are now,  
That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
And make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgimage road.  
Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and min,  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.  
’Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud:

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?  
Like a swift flitting meteor—a fast flying cloud—

Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude go, like the flower and the weed  
That wither away to let others succeed :  
  
So the multitude come, even those we behold,  
  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been:  
  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen:  
We drink the same stream—we see the same sun—  
We run the same course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers did think;  
  
From the death that we shrink from, our fathers did  
shrink:  
  
To the life that we cling to, our fathers did cling ;  
  
But it speeds from us all, like the bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but the story we cannot unfold ;  
  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold :  
  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers can  
come ;  
  
They joyed, but the tongue of theirgladness is dumb.  
  
They died—ah! they died ; we, the things that are  
now,  
  
That tread on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
And make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
  
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage  
road.  
  
Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,  
  
Are mingled together like sunshine and rain ;  
  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the  
dirge,  
  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  
  
Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death—  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud :  
Then why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

Hut it speeds for u all, like a bird on the

They scorned, but the heart of the haughty

They grieved, but no wall from their slum­

They joyed, but the tongue of their glad­

Priest that the mitre bath worn, ?rhe

Brave, Are hidden and lost in the depth

 spirit of mortal be prond ?  
Like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud,  
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,  
Man passes from life to his rest in the grave.  
  
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,  
  
Be scattered around and together be laid,  
  
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,  
Shall moulder to dust and together shall die.  
  
The infant, a mother attended and loved ;  
  
The mother, that infant’s affection who proved ;  
The husband, that mother and infant who blessed ;  
Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.  
  
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose  
  
eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure—her triumphs are by;  
And the memory of those who loved her en  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  
  
The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne ;  
The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn;  
The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depth of the grave,  
  
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
  
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the  
steep ;  
  
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,  
  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  
  
The saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven,  
The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven,  
  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  
  
So the multitude goes, like the flower and weed,  
That wither away to let others succeed ;  
  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  
  
For we are the same that our fathers have been ;  
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,  
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,  
And run the same course that our fathers have run.  
  
The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would  
think ;  
  
From the death we are shrinking, our fathers would  
shrink ;  
  
To the life we are clinging, they also would cling.  
  
But it speeds from us all like a bird on the wing.  
  
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold ;  
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold ;  
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will  
  
come ;  
They joyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb.  
  
They died—ay! they died; and we things that are  
now  
  
Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
  
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.  
  
Yes hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain ;  
  
And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  
  
’Tis the wink of an eye, ’tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—  
O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?

We drink the same stream and we

And run the same course that out

The thoughts we are thinking our

From the death we are shrinking our  
fathers would shrink.  
To the life we arc clinging they also  
would sling;  
But It speeds fur us all, like a bird on  
the wing.  
They loved, but the story we cannot  
unfold;  
They scorned, but the heart of the  
haughty Is cold;  
They grieved, but no wail from their  
slumbers will come;  
They Joyed, but the tongues of their  
gladness Is dumb.  
They died, aye! they died; and we  
things that are now.  
Who walk on the tu-f that lies over  
their brow.  
Who make In their dwellings a tran­  
sient abode.  
Meet the things that they met on their  
pilgrimage road.  
Yea! Hope and despondency, pleasure  
and pain.  
We mingle together In sunshine and  
rain;  
And the smile and the tear, and the  
song and the dirue.  
Still follow each other like surge upon  
surge. ,
