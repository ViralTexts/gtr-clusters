The greatest known Effects of common Lightning, may, I think, without much Difficulty be exceeded in this way: Which a few Years since could not have been believed, and even now may seem to many a little extravagant to suppose.

e Difference between an Electric, and a Non electric Body.  
  
Answ. The Terms Electric per se and Non Electric were first used to distinguish Bodies, on a mistaken Supposition that those alone, called Electric per se, contained electric Matter in their Substance which was capable of being excited by Friction and of being produc’d or drawn from them and communicated to those called Non Electrics suppos’d to be destitute of it: For Glass, &amp;c. being rubbed discover’d Signs of having it, by snapping to the Finger, attracting, repelling, &amp;c. and could communicate those Signs to Metals and Water. Afterwards it was found, that rubbing of Glass would not produce the Electric Matter, unless a Communication was preserv’d between the Rubber and the Floor; and subsequent Experiments prov’d that the Electric Matter was really drawn from those Bodies that at first were thought to have none in them. Then it was doubted whether Glass and other Bodies called Electrics per se had really any Electric Matter in them, since they apparently afforded none but what they first extracted from those which had been called Non Electrics. But some of my Experiments show that Glass contains it in great Quantity; and I now suspect it to be pretty equally diffus’d in all the Matter of this terraqueous Globe. If so, the Terms Electric per se and Non Electric should be laid aside as improper; and (the only Difference being this, that some Bodies will conduct Electric Matter, and others will not) the Terms Conductors and Non Conductors may supply their Place. If any Portion of Electric Matter is apply’d to a Piece of Conducting Matter, it penetrates and flows thro’ it, or spreads equally on its Surface according as situated or circumstanc’d; if apply’d to a Piece of Non Conducting Matter, it will do neither. Perfect Conductors of Electric Matter are only Metals and Water; other Bodies conducting only as they contain a Mixture of those, without more or less of which they will not conduct at all. This (by the way) shows a new Relation between Metals and Water heretofore unknown; and seems to favour some [torn] Opinions of the Formation [torn] Water.  
  
To illustrate this by a Comparison, which however, can [give?] but a faint Resemblance; Electric Matter passes thro’ Conductors as Water passes thro’ a porous Stone; or spreads on their Surfaces as Water spreads on a wet Stone: But when apply’d to Non Conductors ’tis like Water dropt on a greasy Stone, it neither penetrates, passes thro’, nor spreads on the Surface, but remains in Drops wher

difference between an electric and a non-electric body, our au-

tion, that thofe called ele€trics per /2, alone. contained elec.

excited by friction, and of being produced or drawn from  
them and communicated to thofe called non-electrics, fup-  
pofed to be deftitute of it: for the glafs, &amp;c. being rubbed,  
difcovered figns of having it, by {napping to the finger, at~  
tracting, repelling, &amp;c. and could communicate thofe figns  
to metals and water. Afterwards it was found, that rub-  
bing of glafs would not produce the electric matter, unlefs  
a communication was preferved between the rubber and the  
floor ; and fubfequent experiments proved, that the electric  
matter was really drawn from thofe bodies that at firft were  
thought to have none in them. Then it was doubted whe-  
ther glafs and other bodies called cleé?rics per fe, had really.  
any electric matter in them, fince they apparently afforded  
none but what they firft extracted from thofe which had  
been called non-electrics. But fome of my experiments  
fhew, that glafs contains it in great quantity, and I now  
fufpect it to be pretty equally diffufed in all the matter of  
this terraqueous globe. If fo, the terms eleé?ric per fe, and  
non-electric, fhould be laid afide as improper : and (the only  
difference being this, that fome bodies will conduct electric  
matter, and others will not) the terms condudfors, and non-  
conduétors may fupply their place. If any portion of electrical  
matter is applied to a piece of conducting matter, it pene-  
trates and flows through it, or fpreads equally on its furface ;  
if applied to a piece of non-conducting matter, it will do  
neither, Perfect conductors of electric matter are only me-  
tals and water, other bodies conducting only as they con-  
tain a mixture of thofe ; without more or lefs of which they  
will not conduct at all*. This (by the way) fhews a new  
relation between metals and water heretofore unknown.
