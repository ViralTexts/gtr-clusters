My dear Debby  
New York, Friday, May 27. 57Afternoon  
Mr. Parker being doubtful this Morning, whether the Rain would permit his setting out to day, I had prepared no Letter to send per Sally when he took a sudden Resolution to go. Mr. Colden could not spare his Daughter, as she helps him in the Post Office, he having no Clerk.
