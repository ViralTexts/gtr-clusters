In our Almanack for 1750, we gave the Number of Inhabitants in New-Jersey, as taken 1737–8, and 1745, by which it appear’d that the Total of all Ages, Sexes and Colours, amounted  
  
in 1737–8, to  
47369  
  
in 1745, to  
61403  
  
Which makes an Increase in seven Years of  
14034  
  
being almost one Third, tho’ that is a Province into which there are but few direct Importations of Strangers.   
In 1699 an Account was taken of the Freeholders in West-Jersey, by which it appear’d that there were, viz.  
  
In Burlington County, and Maidenhead,  
302  
  
In Gloucester, and Egg-Harbour,  
134  
  
In Salem County,  
326  
  
In Cape-May County,  
70  
  
In all, Freeholders,  
832  
  
If we suppose six Souls to each Freeholder,  
6  
  
There might then be in West-Jersey, Souls,  
4992  
  
In 1745 there were in the same Counties, viz.  
Souls.  
  
Burlington, Hunterdon and Morris, which werein 1699 all Burlington County,  
20180  
  
Gloucester, which includes Egg Harbour,  
3506  
  
Salem,  
6847  
  
Cape-May,  
1188  
  
In all, Souls,  
31821  
  
By which it appears that West-Jersey has increased in Forty-six Years, more than six for one; tho’ some of its Counties are from their Situation reckoned not very healthy.
