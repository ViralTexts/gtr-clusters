Sir,  
Boston, Dec. 22, 1754  
Since the conversation your Excellency was pleased to honour me with, on the subject of uniting the Colonies more intimately with Great Britain, by allowing them Representatives in Parliament, I have something further considered that matter, and am of opinion, that such an Union would be very acceptable to the Colonies, provided they had a reasonable number of Representatives allowed them; and that all the old Acts of Parliament restraining the trade or cramping the manufactures of the Colonies, be at the same time repealed, and the British Subjects on this side the water put, in those respects, on the same footing with those in Great Britain, ’till the new Parliament, representing the whole, shall think it for the interest of the whole to re-enact some or all of them: It is not that I imagine so many Representatives will be allowed the Colonies, as to have any great weight by their numbers; but I think there might be sufficient to occasion those laws to be better and more impartially considered, and perhaps to overcome the private interest of a petty corporation, or of any particular set of artificers or traders in England, who heretofore seem, in some instances, to have been more regarded than all the Colonies, or than was consistent with the general interest, or best national good. I think too, that the government of the Colonies by a Parliament, in which they are fairly represented, would be vastly more agreeable to the people, than the method lately attempted to be introduced by Royal Instructions, as well as more agreeable to the nature of an English Constitution, and to English Liberty; and that such laws as now seem to bear hard on the Colonies, would (when judged by such a Parliament for the best interest of the whole) be more chearfully submitted to, and more easily executed.  
I should hope too, that by such an union, the people of Great Britain and the people of the Colonies would learn to consider themselves, not as belonging to different Communities with different Interests, but to one Community with one Interest, which I imagine would contribute to strengthen the whole, and greatly lessen the danger of future separations.  
It is, I suppose, agreed to be the general interest of any state, that it’s people be numerous and rich; men enow to fight in its defence, and enow to pay sufficient taxes to defray the charge; for these circumstances tend to the security of the state, and its protection from foreign power: But it seems not of so much importance whether the fighting be done by John or Thomas, or the tax paid by William or Charles: The iron manufacture employs and enriches British Subjects, but is it of any importance to the state, whether the manufacturers live at Birmingham or Sheffield, or both, since they are still within its bounds, and their wealth and persons at its command? Could the Goodwin Sands be laid dry by banks, and land equal to a large country thereby gain’d to England, and presently filled with English Inhabitants, would it be right to deprive such Inhabitants of the common privileges enjoyed by other Englishmen, the right of vending their produce in the same ports, or of making their own shoes, because a merchant, or a shoemaker, living on the old land, might fancy it more for his advantage to trade or make shoes for them? Would this be right, even if the land were gained at the expence of the state? And would it not seem less right, if the charge and labour of gaining the additional territory to Britain had been borne by the settlers themselves? And would not the hardship appear yet greater, if the people of the new country should be allowed no Representatives in the Parliament enacting such impositions? Now I look on the Colonies as so many Counties gained to Great Britain, and more advantageous to it than if they had been gained out of the sea around its coasts, and joined to its land: For being in different climates, they afford greater variety of produce, and materials for more manufactures; and being separated by the ocean, they increase much more its shipping and seamen; and since they are all included in the British Empire, which has only extended itself by their means; and the strength and wealth of the parts is the strength and wealth of the whole; what imports it to the general state, whether a merchant, a smith, or a hatter, grow rich in Old or New England? And if, through increase of people, two smiths are wanted for one employed before, why may not the new smith be allowed to live and thrive in the new Country, as well as the old one in the Old? In fine, why should the countenance of a state be partially afforded to its people, unless it be most in favour of those, who have most merit? and if there be any difference, those, who have most contributed to enlarge Britain’s empire and commerce, encrease her strength, her wealth, and the numbers of her people, at the risque of their own lives and private fortunes in new and strange countries, methinks ought rather to expect some preference.  
With the greatest respect and esteem I have the honour to be Your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant

“ Since the converfation your excel-

very acceptable to the colonies, pro-  
vided they had a reafonable number of  
reprefentatives allowed them ; and  
that all the old ats of parliament re.  
ftraining the trade or cramping the ma-  
nufactures of the colonies, be at the  
fametime repealed, andthe Britith fub-  
jeéts on this fide the water put, in thofe

not that I imagine fo many reprefen-

as to have-any ‘great weight by their

fuffitient to Octafion thofe laws to be

to enact fome or all of them: it is not  
that I imagine fo many reprefentatives will  
be allowed the Colonies, as to have any  
great weight by their numbers; but I  
think there might be fufficient to occafion  
thofe laws to be better and more impar-  
tially confidered, and perhaps to overcome  
the intereft of a petty corporation, or of any  
pauticular fet of artificers or traders in  
England, who heretofore feem, in fome  
inftances, to have been more regarded than  
all the Colonies, or than was confiitent  
with the general intereft, or beft national  
good. I think too that the government of  
the Colonies, by a Parliament, in which  
they are fairly reprefented, would be vafily  
more agreeable to the people, than the  
method lately attempted to be introduced  
by royal inftruction, as well as more  
agreeable to the nature of an Englifh con-  
ftitution, and to Englith liberty ; and  
that fuch laws as now feem to bear hard  
on the Colonies would (when judged. by  
fuch a Parliament, for the beft intereft of  
the whole) be more chearfully fubmitted  
to, and more eafily executed.  
  
I fhould hope too, that, by fuch an  
union, the people of Great Britain, and  
the people of the Colonies, would learn  
to confider themfelves, as not belonging  
to different communities with different in-  
terefts, but to one community with one in-  
tereft ; which I imagine would contribute  
to ftrengthen the whole, and greatly leffen  
the danger of future feparations.  
  
It is, I fuppofe, agreed to be the general  
interelt of any ftate, that its people be nu-  
merous and rich ; men enow to fizht in its  
defence, and enow to pay fufficient taxes to  
defray the charge ; for thele circumftances  
tend to the fecurity of the ftate, and its pro-  
teétion from foreign power. But it feems  
not of fo much importance whether the  
fighting be done by John or Thomas, or  
the tax paid by William or Charles. The  
iron manufaéture employs and inriches Bri-  
tith fubjeéts, but is it of any importance to  
the ftate whether the manufaéturer lives at  
Birmingham, or Sheffield, or both, fince  
they are Rill within its bounds, and their  
wealth and perfons ftill at its command ?  
Could the Goodwin fands be laid dry by  
banks, and land equal to a large country  
thereby gained to England, and prefently  
filled with Englith inhabitants, would it be  
right to deprive fuch inhabitants of the  
common privileges enjoyed by other Eng-  
lithmen, the right of vending their produce  
in the fame ports, or of making their own  
thoes, becaufe a merchant or a fhoe-maker,  
living on the old land, might fancy it more  
  
for his advantage to trade or make flioes  
for them? Would this be right, even if  
the land were gained at the expence of the  
ftate? And would it not feem lefs righ:, if  
the charge and labour of gaining tne addi-  
tional territory to Britain had been borne  
by the feulers themfelves ? And would not  
the hardfhips appear yet greater, if the peo-  
ple of the new country fhould be allowed  
no reprefentatives in Par&#x27;iament enaéting  
fach impofitions ; now I look on the Colo-  
nies as fo many countries gained to Great  
Britain, and more advantageous ta it, than  
if they had been gained out of the fea  
around our coalts, and joined to its land ;  
for, being in different climates, they afford  
greater variety of produce, and materials  
for more manufactures ; and being fepara-  
ted by the ocean they increafe much more  
its fhipping and feamen ; and fince they  
are all included in the Britifh empire, which  
has only extended itfelf by their means ;  
and the ftrength and wealth of the parts is  
the ftrength and wealth of the whole;  
what imports it to the general ftate, whe-  
ther a merchant, a fmith, or a hatter, grow  
rich in Old or New England? And if,  
through increafe of people, two fmiths are  
wanted for one employed before, why may  
not the new fmith be allowed to live and  
thrive in the new country, as well as the  
old one in the old ? In fine, why fhould the

thofe who have moft merit ? And, if there  
be any difference, thofe who have moft

commerce, increafe her ftrength, her wealth,  
and the numbers of her people, at the rifque  
of their own lives and private fortunes in
