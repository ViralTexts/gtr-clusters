d called for a Bible and read what purported to be Chapter 27 of Genesis. Upon examining his own Bible the next morning Strahan discovered that “there was no such chapter, and that the whole was a well meant invention of my friend, whose sallies of humour, in which he is a great master, have always an unusual and benevolent tendency. With some difficulty I procured a copy of what he pretended to read, which I now send you for the entertainment of your readers.” Strahan added his hope that it would not be inappropriate at that Easter season, when the Church called upon its members “to commemorate the Amazing love of HIM, who possessing the divine virtue of Charity in the most supreme degree, laid down his life EVEN FOR HIS ENEMIES.”

n to Lord Kames by Dr. Franklin and that it had lately appeared in the London Chronicle with two added verses. The magazine thereupon printed the text of the Parable, using the Chronicle form of the Dick version, not the Kames version from the book under review.  
In 1774 Lord Kames again printed the Parable, this time in his Sketches of the History of Man. He used his own earlier version, but in a truncated form, since only the first eleven verses appeared; these were again unnumbered and were set as a solid paragraph. The omission of verses 12 and 13 remains unexplained. He introduced the piece by saying that it “was communicated to me by Dr. Franklin of Philadelphia,” and described it as a “parable against persecution,” the earliest use known of this expression.  
This shortened form of the Kames version also had a wide circulation, partly because Benjamin Vaughan reprinted it in 1779 in his edition of Franklin’s Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces. In a footnote Vaughan acknowledged Kames’s Sketches as his source and quoted from it the intr

e “an amiable sentiment … would certainly have been defeated, had he prefixed to the printed copies of the parable, which he was fond of dispersing, an intimation of its author. He therefore gave no name whatever to it, much less his own.” As often as Vaughan had heard him “read” the Parable, he had never heard Franklin claim authorship; “His good humor constantly led him into a train of amusing stories concerning the persons who had mistaken it for scripture, (for he had bound it up as a leaf in his bible, the better to impose upon them,) which, perhaps, made the point of authorship forgotten.”  
Franklin was of course unperturbed by the charge. He saw it, and he read and appreciated Vaughan’s defense. “The truth is,” he wrote, “that I never published that Chapter, and never claimed more credit from it, than what related to the style, and the addition of the concluding threatening and promise.” Lord Kames’s publishing of it without his consent had deprived him “of a good deal of amusement, which I used to take in reading it by heart out of my Bible, and obtaining the remarks of the Scriptuarians upon it, which were sometimes very diverting; not but that it is in itself, on account of the importance of its moral, well worth being made known to all mankind.”  
  
Chap. XXVII  
1. And it came to pass after these Things, that Abraham sat in the Door of his Tent, about the going down of the Sun.  
2. And behold a Man, bowed with Age, came from the Way of the Wilderness, leaning on a Staff.  
3. And Abraham arose and met him, and said unto him, Turn in, I pray thee, and wash thy Feet, and tarry all Night, and thou shalt arise early on the Morrow, and go on thy Way.  
  
4. And the Man said, Nay, for I will abide under this Tree.  
5. But Abraham pressed him greatly; so he turned, and they went into the Tent; and Abraham baked unleavend Bread, and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that the Man blessed not God, he said unto him, Wherefore dost thou not worship the most high God, Creator of Heaven and Earth?  
7. And the Man answered and said, I do not worship the God thou speakest of; neither do I call upon his Name; for I have made to myself a God, which abideth alway in mine House, and provideth me with all Things.  
8. And Abraham’s Zeal was kindled against the Man; and he arose, and fell upon him, and drove him forth with Blows into the Wilderness.  
9. And at Midnight God called unto Abraham, saying, Abraham, where is the Stranger?  
10. And Abraham answered and said, Lord, he would not worship thee, neither would he call upon thy Name; therefore have I driven him out from before my Face into the Wilderness.  
11. And God said, Have I born with him these hundred ninety and eight Years, and nourished him, and cloathed him, notwithstanding his Rebellion against me, and couldst not thou, that art thyself a Sinner, bear with him one Night?  
12. And Abraham said, Let not the Anger of my Lord wax hot against his Servant. Lo, I have sinned; forgive me, I pray Thee:  
13. And Abraham arose and went forth into the Wilderness, and sought diligently for the Man, and found him, and returned with him to his Tent; and when he had entreated him kindly, he sent him away on the Morrow with Gifts.  
14. And God spake again unto Abraham, saying, For this thy Sin shall thy Seed be afflicted four Hundred Years in a strange Land:  
  
15. But for thy Repentance will I deliver them; and they shall come forth with Power, and with Gladness of Heart, and with much Substance.

1. And it came to pass after these things,  
that Abraham sat in the door of his tent,  
about the going down, of the sun,  
  
2. And behold, a man bowed with age,  
coming from the way of the wilderness  
leaning on a staiF.  
  
3. And Abraham arose, and met hinri,  
and said unto him,.turn in, I pr^y thee,  
and wash thy feet, and tarry allnighpi  
and thou sh&#x27;alt arise early in the morning,  
and go on thy way..  
  
4. But the man said, nay&#x27;, for I will  
abide under this tree,  
  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly ;  
so he turned, and they went into the tent:  
and Abraham baked unleavened bread,  
and they did eat.  
  
G. And when Abraham saw that the  
man blessed not God, he said unto hinr,  
Wherefore dost thou not worship the  
most high God, creator of -Heaven and  
Earth?  
  
7. And the man ans^vered and s&#x27;aid»  
I do not worship thy God, neither*do f  
call upon his name ; for I have made to  
myself a God, which abideth alway in  
mine house, ^nd providelh me with all  
things.  
  
! 8. And Abraham^s zeal was kindled  
  
against the man, and he arose, and felt  
upon him, and drave him forth with  
blows into the wilderness,  
  
“9. And at midnight God called unto  
Abraham, saying, Abraham, where is the  
stranger ?  
  
10. And Abraham answered and said,  
Lord, be would not worship thee, nei¬  
ther would he call upon thy name; there¬  
fore have I driven him out from before  
my face, into the wilderness.

years, afnd nourished him, and clothed  
him, notwithstanding his rebellion a-  
gainst n»e; and coiildest not thou, that  
art thyself a sinner, bear v^ith him one  
night ?  
  
12. - And Abraham said, Let not the  
anger of the Lord wax hot against&#x27;his  
servant; lo, 1 have sinned r forgive me,  
I pray thee.  
  
13. And he arose, and went forth into  
the wilderness, and sought diligently for  
the man, and found him:  
  
14. And returned with him to his tent;  
and when he had entreated him kindly,  
he sent him away in the morning with  
gifts.  
  
15. And God spake again unto Abra¬  
ham, saying, for this thy sin, shall thy seed  
be afflicted four hundred years In a strange  
land.  
  
16. But for thy repentance will I deli¬  
ver them j and they shall come forth with  
power, and with gladness of heart, and  
with much substance.

and had examined the scriptures carefully with  
his concordance to find it, but had not beep  
successful. The old gentleman finding that we  
were interested in it, kindly made us a  
present of it. It will be seen that its antiquated,  
scriptural style, would give the impression that  
it was a quotation from Genesis. Here it is,  
It contains an important moral.  
  
“And it came to pass, after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door of his tent about the  
going down of the sun, and behold a man bent  
with age came from the way of the wilderness  
leaning ona staff. And Abraham arose and  
met him and said unto him, Turn in, I pray  
thee, and wash thy feet and tarry all night;  
and thou shalt arise in the morning early and  
goon thy way; and the man said, nay, for]  
will abide under this tree. But Abraham pres-  
sed him greatly ; so he turned and they went  
into the tent, and Abraham baked unleaven  
bread and they did eat. And when Abraham  
saw that the man blessed not God, he said unto  
  
  
  
  
  
him, Wherefore dost thou not worship the most &gt;

And the man answered and said, I do not  
worship thy God, neither doI call upon his  
name; for [ have made to myself a god which  
abideth always in my house and provideth me

kindled against the man, and he arose and fell  
upon him and drove him forth with blows into  
the wilderness. And God ealled unto Abraham,  
Where is the stranger? and Abraham answered  
and said, Lerd, he would not worship thee,  
neither would he call upon thy name; therefore  
have I driven him out from before my fice into  
the wilderness. And God said, have { mt borne  
with him these one hundred and _ninety-eight

in expressing any sentiments which he wished  
to inculcate upon mankind. One of the most  
striking examples of this is the celebrated Para-  
ble against persecution of which he is generally  
considered the author ; it is as follows :  
  
ND it came to pass  
after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door  
of his tent, about the  
going down of the sun.  
2. And behold, a  
man, bowed with age,  
came from the way of  
the wilderness, leaning  
on a staff  
3. And Abraham arose and met  
him, and said unto him, “ Turn in, I  
pray thee, and wash thy feet, and tar-  
ry all night, and thou shalt arise early  
on the morrow, and go on thy way.”  
4. But the man said, “ Nay, for I will abide  
under this tree.”  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly ; so he  
  
turned, and they went into the tent, and Abra  
ham baked unleavened brgad, and they did eat  
  
6. And when Abraham saw that the map  
blessed not God, he said unto him, “ Wherefore  
dost thou not worship the most high God, Creat.  
or of heaven and earth ?”  
  
7. And the man answered and said, “I dong  
worship the God thou speakest of, neither do |  
call upon his name ; for I have made to myself a  
god, which abideth alway in mine house, anj  
provideth me with all things.”  
  
8. And Abraham’s zeal was kindled against  
the man, and he arose and fell upon him, and  
drove him forth with blows into the wiMerness.  
  
9. And at midnight God called unto Abraham,  
saying, ‘‘ Abraham, where is the stranger &quot;’  
  
10. And Abraham answered and said, “ Lord,  
he would not worship thee, neither would he call  
upon thy name ; therefore have I driven him out  
from before my face into the wilderness.”  
  
11. And God said, ‘“ Have I borne with him  
these hundred ninety and eight years, and nour  
ished him, and clothed him, notwithstanding his  
rebellion against me ; and couldst not thou, that  
art thyself a sinner, bear with him one night!”

Almighty, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? 9. And the man answered,  
I worship not thy God, neither do I call upon his name; for I have made gods  
for myself that dwell in my honse, and hear me when I call upon them. 10. Then!  
the wrath of Abraham was kindled against the man, and he stood up and fell upon  
him, and drove him forth into the wilderness. 11. And God cried, Abraham !  
Abraham ! and Abraham answered, Here am I. 12. And God said, where is the  
stranger that was with thee? 13. Then answered Abraham and said, Lord, he  
would not reverence thee nor call upon thy name, and therefore have | driven  
him from before my face into the wilderness. 14. And the Lord said unto  
Abraham, Have I borne with the man these hundred and ninety-eight years, and  
given him food and raiment although he has rebelled against me, and canst thou  
not bear with him one night? 15. And Abraham said, Let not the wrath of my  
Lord be kindled against his servant, behold I have sinned! forgive me. 16. And  
Abraham stood up and went forth into the wilderness, and cried and sought the  
man, and found him and led him back into his tent, and dealt kindly by him, and  
the next morning he let himmgo in peace.

Abraham sat in the door of his tent, about the

2. And behold a man, bowed with age, came  
from the way of the wilderness leaning on a staff.

ham baked unleavened bread, and they did eat.

blessed not God, he said unto him, 44 Wherefore  
dost thou not worship the most high God, Crea  
tor of beaven and earth 7 &#x27;  
7. And the man answered and said, 44 1 do not

the man, and he arose and fell upon him, and  
drove him furth with blows into the wilderness  
9. And at midnight God called unto Abraham,  
saying, 44 Abraham, where is the stranger

said, Ido not worship the God thou

&quot;Genesis rifty-One.&quot;  
For the past 500 or GOO years the  
  
following so-called &quot;Qenesi3 Fifty-  
one,&quot; has been a puzzle to biblical  
scholars ; andt today, were it read  
aloud in any mixed company, it is  
questionable if its fraudulent nature  
would be discovered, so beautifully  
Is4he spirit and language of the Old  
Testament imitated. Below we give  
this unique fraud in full :  
1. And it came to pass after these  
things that Abraham sat in the door  
of his tent at about the going down  
of the sun.  
2. And behold a man, bowed with  
age, came from the way of the wil­  
derness, leaning on a staff.  
3. And Abraham arose and met  
him, Turn Id, I pray thee, and wash  
thy feet, and tarry all night, and  
thou shalt arise early on the morrow  
and go thy way.  
4. But the man said, Nay, for I  
will abide under this tree.  
5. And Abraham pressed him  
greatly, so he turned and they went  
into the tent; and Abraham broke  
uuleavened bread, and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that  
the man blessed not God, he said un­  
to him, whereiore doest thou not wor  
ship the Most High God, creator of  
heaven and earth.  
7. And the man answered and said,  
I do not worship the God thon speak­  
est of, neither do I call upon His  
name, for I have made to myself a  
God which abideth always in my  
house and provideth me with all  
thing3.  
8. And Abraham&#x27;s anger was kin  
dled against that man for what he  
had said, and he arose and drove  
him forth with blows into tho wil­  
derness.9. And at midnigth God called  
upon Abraham, saying, Abraham,  
where is the stranger that came by  
the way of thy tent at the going  
down of the sun.  
10. And Abraham answered and  
said, Lord, he would not worship  
Thee, neither would he call upon  
Thy name, therefore I have driven  
him out from before my face into the  
wilderness.  
11. And God said, Have I not  
borne with him these hundred and  
ninety and eight years, and nourish­  
ed him, and clothed him, notwith­  
standing he has rebelled against Me?  
Couldst thou not, thee thyself being  
a sinner, bear with him one night ?  
12. And Abraham said, Let not the  
anger of my Lord wax against his  
servant ;. lo ! I have sinned, forgive  
me I pray of Thee.  
13. And Abraham arose and went  
forth into the wilderness and sought  
diligently for the man until he had  
found him and returnMl with him  
to the tent, and when he had enter­  
tained him kindly he sent him away  
on the morrow with many gifts.  
14. And God spake again unto  
Abraham saying, &#x27;for this thy sin  
against;the stranger, thy seed shall  
be afflicted four hundred years in a  
strange land.  
15. But for thy repentance, will I  
deliver them, and they shall come  
forth with power and with gladness  
of heart.

of the sun.  
2. And behold a man, bowed with  
age, came from the way of the  
wilderness, leaning on a staff.  
3. And Abraham arose and met  
him and said unto him, Turn in, I  
pray thee and wash thy feet, jnd  
tarry all night, and thou shalt arise  
early on the morrow and go thy  
way.  
4. But the man said: Nay, for I  
will abide under this tree.  
5. And Abraham pressed him  
greatly, so he turned and they went  
into thf tent; and Abraham broke  
unleavened bread and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that  
the man blessed not God, he said  
unto him: Wherefore dost thou  
not worship the Most High God,  
creator of the heaven and earth?  
7. And the man answered and  
said, I do not worship the God  
thou speakest of, neither do I call  
upon his name, for I have made to  
myself a God which abideth alway  
in my house and provideth me with  
all things.  
8. And Abraham&#x27;s anger was  
kindled against that man for what  
he had said, and he arose and drove  
him forth with blows into the  
wilderness.  
9. And at midnight God called  
upon Abraham, saying, Abraham,  
where is the stranger that came by  
the way of thy tent at the going  
down of the sun.  
10. And Abraham answered and  
said, Lord he would not worship  
thee, neither would he call upon  
thy name, therefore I have driven  
him out from before my face into  
the wilderness.  
11. And God said, have I not  
borne with him these hundred and  
ninty and eight years, and nourish  
ed him, and clothed him, notwith­  
standing he has rebelled against  
Me? Couldst thou not, thou thyself  
being a sinner, bear with him one  
night?  
12. And Abraham said: Let not  
the anger of my Lord wax against  
his servant; lo! I have sinned, for­  
give me, I pray of Thee.  
13. And Abraham arose and went  
forth into the wilderness, and sought  
diligently for the man until he had  
found him, and returned with him  
to the tent, and when he had enter­  
tained him kindly he sent him away  
on the morrow with many gifts.  
14. And God spake again unto  
Abraham, saying, for this thy sin  
against the stranger thy seed shall  
be afflicted 400 years in a strange  
land.

-GENESIS FIFTY-ONE.&quot;  
A B.blical ForgaryWhich Has rai­  
zed Scholars For 500 Years.  
Fur the past .»00 years the f-llow­  
: ing so-called &quot; Genesis Fifty-one&quot; has  
been a puzzle to biblical scholars, and  
to-day, were it read aloud in any mixed  
■ company, it is questionable, says the  
St. liOuis Republic,if its fradulent na­  
ture would be discovered, so beauti­

give this unique fraud a full:  
1. And it came to pass after these  
things that Abraham sat iu the door  
of his tent about the going down of  
; the sun.  
2. And behold a man bowed with  
age, came from the way of the wilder­

11. And Abraham arose and met  
; him ami said unto him, Turn in, 1  
l pray thee, and wash thy feet, and  
| tarry all night, and thou shalt arise  
j early on the morrow and go thy way.  
4. But the man said, Nay, for I  
will abide under this tree.  
5. And Abraham pressed him  
greatly, so he turned and they went  
| into the lent; and Abraham broke  
unleavened bread and they did eat.  
&lt;i. And when Abraham saw that  
the man blessed not God, he said unto  
him, wherefore dost thou not wor­  
ship the Most High God, creator of  
heaven and earth.  
7. And the man answered and  
; said, I do not worship the God thou  
speakest of neither do I call upon  
; His name, for I have made to myself a  
; God which abideth always in my  
house and provideth me with all  
&#x27; things.  
8. And Abraham&#x27;s anger kindled  
against that man for what he had said,

said, Lord, he would not worship  
thee, neither would he call upon Thy  
name; therefore 1 have driven him  
out from before my faco into the  
wilderness.

with him these hundred and ninety  
and eight years, and nourished him  
and clothed him, notwithstanding he  
has rebelled against Me? Couldst  
thou not, thee thyself being a sinner,

A BIBLICAL FORQERY.  
For the past 500 or C00 years

6- And when Abraham saw that  
the man blessed not God, he said  
unto him. Wherefore dost thou  
not worship the Most High God,  
creatoi of heaven and earth?  
7. And the man answereth and  
said, I do not worship the God thou  
speakest of, neither do I call upon  
his name, for I have made to my­  
self a god which abideth always in

8. And Abraham&#x27;s anger was  
kindled against that man for what  
he had said, and he arose and  
drove him forth with blows intothe  
wilderness.  
9. And at midnight God called  
upon Abraham, saying, Abraham,  
where is the stranger that came by  
the way of thy tent at the going  
down of the sun?  
10. And Abraham answered  
and said, Lord, he would not wor­  
ship thee, neither would he call  
upon thy name, therefore I have  
driven him out before my face into

A BIBLICAL CURIOSITY.  
j It. Has Puzzled Scholars for More Than  
Five Hundred Years.  
1. And it came to pass after theso  
things that Abraham sat in the door of  
his tent at about the going down of  
the sun.  
2. And behold a man, bowed down  
with ago, came from the way of the  
wilderness, leaning on a staff. &#x27;  
8. And Abraham arose and met him  
and said unto him. Turn in, I pray  
j thee, and wash thy feet, and tarry all  
night, and thou shaft arise early and  
go thy way.  
4. But the man said: Nav.for I will  
abide under this tree,  
&lt; 5 . And Abraham pressed him groat­  
ly, so he turned and they went into the  
tent; and Abraham broke unleavened  
bread and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that the  
man blessed not God, he said unto him:  
Wherefore dost thou not worship the  
Most High God, creator of heaven and  
For the past 500 or 000 years the fol­  
lowing so-called &quot;Genesis Fifty-one&quot;  
has been a puzzle to biblical scholars,  
and were it read aloud in any mixed  
company it is questionable whether its  
fraudulent nature would be discovered  
so beautifully is tho spirit and lan­  
guage of the Old Testament imitated.  
Below we give this unimio fraud in  
full:  
earth?  
7. And the man answered and said, I  
do not worship tho God thou speakest  
of. neither do 1 call upon his name, for  
i have made to myself a god which  
abidoth alway in my house and provid­  
eth mo with all things.  
8. And Abraham&#x27;s anger was kindled  
against that man for what ho had said,  
and he arose and drove him forth with  
blows into tho wilderness.  
!). And at midnight God called upon  
Abraham saying, Abraham, where is  
the stranger that came by the way of  
thy tent at the going down of the sun?  
10. And Abr.ahanf answered and said,  
Lord, lie would not worship thee,nei­  
ther would he call upon thy name,  
therefore I have driven him out from  
before my face into tho wilderness.  
11. And God said, Ha ve I not borne  
with him these hundred and ninety  
eight years, and nourisned him, and  
clothed him. notwithstanding he has  
rebelled against me? Could thou not,  
thee thyself being a sinner, hear with  
him one night?  
12. And Abraham said: Let not thy  
anger, my Lord, wax against his ser­  
vant, lo! I have sinned, forgive me 1  
pray of thoe.  
13. And Abraham arose and wont  
forth into the wilderness, and sought  
diligently until he had found him, and  
returned with him to the tent, and  
when he had entertained him kindly  
he sent him away on the morrow with  
many gifts.  
14. And God spake again unto Abra­  
ham, saying, for this thy sin against  
the stranger, thy seed shall be afflict­  
ed in a strange land.  
15. But, for thy repentance, will I  
deliver them, and they shall como  
forth with power and with gladness of  
heart

of humanity. At length, in support of  
what he had advanced, he called for a  
Bible, and turning to the book of Genesis  
he read as follows:  
  
CHAP. LXVII.  
  
And it came to pass after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door of his tent, about the  
going down of the sun.  
  
2. And behold, a man bowed with age, com-  
ing from the way of the wilderness, leaning  
on a staff.  
  
3. And Abraham arose and met him, and  
said unto him, Turn in, I pray thee, and wash  
thy feet and tarry all night; and thou shalt  
arise early in the morning and go thy way.  
  
4. But the man said, Nay, for I will abide  
under this tree.  
  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly ; so he  
turned and they went into the tent; and Abra-  
ham baked unleavened bread, and they did  
eat.  
  
6. And when Abraham saw that the man  
blessed not God, he said unto him, Wherefore  
dost thou not worship the most high God, cre-  
ator of heaven and earth?  
  
7. And the man answered and said, I do not  
worship thy God, neither do I call upon his  
name; for I have made to myself a God which  
abideth always in my house, and provideth  
me with all things.  
  
8. And Abraham’s zeal was kindled against  
the man, and he arose and fell upon him and  
drave him forth with blows into the wilder-  
ness.  
  
9, And at midnight God called unto Abra-  
ham, saying, Abraham, where is the stranger ?  
  
10. And Abraham answered and said, Lord,  
he would not worship thee, neither would he  
call upon thy name; therefore have I driven  
him out from before my face into the wilder-  
ness.  
  
11. And God said, Have I borne with him  
these hundred, ninety and eight years, and  
nourished him and clothed him, notwithstand-  
ing his rebellion against me; and coulds’t not  
thou, that art thyself a sinner, bear with him  
one night?  
  
12. And Abraham said, Let not the anger of  
my Lord wax hot against his servant: lo, I  
have sinned ; forgive me I pray thee.  
  
13. And he arose and went forth into the  
wilderness, and sought diligently for the man  
and found him:  
  
14. And returned with him to his tent; and  
when he had entreated him kindly, he sent  
him away in the morning with gifts.  
  
15. And God spake again unto Abraham,  
saying, For this thy sin shall thy seed be af-  
flicted four hundred years in a strange land.  
  
16. But for thy repentance will I deliver  
them; and they shall come forth with power,  
and with gladness of heart, and with much  
substance.
