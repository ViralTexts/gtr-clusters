The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish language, except the &quot;Ode of Luis de Leon.&quot;  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arounds its senses and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
Tomorrow, than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of Death, whose waves roll on  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulet&#x27;s glide  
To that sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride—  
The rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal:  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here!  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of earth can blight,  
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away:  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The steps that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and wo!  
When age comes on!

And the stern footstep of decay  
Comes stealing on.  
  
How pleasure, like the passing wind,  
  
Blows by, and leaves us nought behind,  
But grief at last ;  
  
How still our present happiness  
  
Sceins, to the wayward fancy, less  
Than what is past.  
  
And while we eye the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flying minutes glide  
Away so fast;  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream of joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day.  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright  
  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulfing sea  
Are doomed to fall;  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on,  
O’er king end kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble riv’lets glide

O! let the soul its slumbers break,  
Arouse its senses, and awake

Life, like its glories, glides away,

Always so fast,

Like them decay.  
  
Our lives Jike hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on,  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.

Long ere the damp of death can blight,

Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that rolled so light and gay,

The strength is gore, the step is slow,  
And ae grows weariness and wo,

 POETARY.  
  
The following is a teanslation from an an­  
cient Spanish Poem, which, says the Edinharg  
Review, is surpassed by nothing with which  
wo are acquainted in the Spaniah language ex­  
cept the Odes of Lewis de Leon.,  
» .  
O, let the sonl its slumbers brealk,  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
&#x27;T&#x27;o see how soon  
Life like his glories glide away,  
And the steen footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while waavethe rolling tide,  
Down which onre floating minnies glide  
Awny so fast;  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem ench foture dvonm a joy  
Alivady past,  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind-  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day ;  
Onr golden dreanis of yore were hright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay,  
  
Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into one engnlfing sea  
Are doomed o fall   
Tha sen of deathy, whose waves roll on,  
Oor king and Kingdom, crown &amp; throne,  
And swallow all,  
  
Alike the rivera lordly tide  
Alike the hamble riv&#x27;lot’s glide,  
To that sud wave ;  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor slevp side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our bieth is ot a starting place,  
Life is the running of the rmee,  
And death the goal;  
There all those ghttering tovs nre houghit,  
That path alone of all nnsought,  
Is tuund of alt.  
  
Say, then, how poor and ‘ittle worth  
Are all these glitering toys of earth,  
That lure us here?  
Dream of a slecp that death must broak,  
Alas ! before it bids s wake  
To disappear!  
  
Loang ere the lump of death ean blight  
T&#x27;he chosk&#x27;s pure glow of ved and white

Youth siided and all was heavenly fair;  
Age cmme and Lad has fingere there,  
And wihcre ave they?  
  
Where is the strength that sparns decay,  
The step that volled so hight and gay,

The following is a translation from an ancient Span-  
  
ish Poem, which, says the Edinburgh Review, is sur-  
| passed by nothing with which we are acquainted in the  
| Spanish language, except the Odes of Luis de Leon.  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break,  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon  
Life, like its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on. *  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
  
Nor happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day;  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright;  
  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one ingulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on,  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble riv’let’s, glide  
To that sad wave:  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place!  
Life is the running of the race,  
  
And death the goal:  
There all these glittering toys are brought;  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
  
Is found of all.  
  
Say, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth,  
That lure us here?  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break;  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear!  
  
Long ere the lamp of death can blight,  
  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair;  
  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that rolled so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome and wo,  
When age comes on.

THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECAY.  
The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish  
poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by  
nothing with which we are scquainted in the Spanish lan­  
guage, except the ** Ode of Luis de Leon:”  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
Down with our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
Let no vain hope deceive our mind—  
No halypier let us hope to find  
o-morrow than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
Qur lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engnlphinf sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death whose waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and threne,  
. And swallow all.  
Alike the river’s lordl{ tide  
Alike the humble rivalet&#x27;s giide  
To that sad wave;  
Death levels (roverty and pride,  
And rich an goor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
Our birth is but a starting-place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
s There all our glmerinf toys are brought—  
That %:th alone, of all unzought,  
found of all.  
See, then, how poor and little worth

Our birth is but a starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death tne goal;  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
The path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found ef ail.  
See then how poor and little worth

 AL.  
THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECAY.  
The following is a translation from an ancient  
Spanish Poem, which, says the Edinburg Reeiew,  
is surpassed by nothing with which we are acquaint­  
ed in the Spanish language, except the &quot;Ode of  
Louis de Leon.&quot;  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind  
No happier let us hope to find  
To morrow than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight  
Like them decay;  
Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall  
The sea of death whose waves roll on  
Oer king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulets glide  
To that sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering tors are brought-  
path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
See then how poor and little worth  
Are all these glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here!  
preams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
Long ere the damp of earth can blight  
The cheeks pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away,  
Youth smiled and all was heavenly fair  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the stepis slow,  
And joy grows wearisome and wo!  
When ages come on.

Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight —

Our lives like hastning streams must be  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, where waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown andthrone,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulets glide  
  
To that sad wave.  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting-place—  
Life is the funning of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
The path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all these glittering toys of earth .  
That lure us here!  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of earth can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away.  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair —  
Age came and laid hiß finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurns decay,  
.The step that roved so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,.  
And joy grows wearisome, and wOe

THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECAY  
  
[The following is a translation from an ancient  
Spanish poem, which, says the Edinburgh Review, is  
surpassed by nothing with which we are acquainted  
in the Spanish language, except the “Ode of Louis  
de Leon.”’)  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,  
  
No bappier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day;  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O’er ing and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulets glide  
To that sad wave!  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And 1ich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Onur birth is but a starting-place ;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Ts found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lureus here!  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came and laid bis finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that roved so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and wo!  
When age comes on!

THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECAY.  
  
  
  
The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish  
poem, which, says the Edinburgh Review, is surpassed by  
nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish lan-  
guage except the ‘Ode of Louis De Leon.”  
  
  
  
O! xert the soul its slumbers break—  
Arouse its senses, and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,  
  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day;  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into one ingulfing sea:  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
  
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,  
To that sad wave!  
  
Death levels, poverty and pride,  
  
And rich and poor sleep side by side,  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but the starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys are bought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here;  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
Youth smiled and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came, and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and woe!  
When age comes on!

The Footstps of Decay.  
  
The following is a translation from an ancient  
cpanisn poem, which, says the .bamuurgh ite­  
view, is surpassed by nothing with which we  
are acquainted in the Spanish language.  
O, let the soul its slumber break,  
Arouse its and  
  
- senses, awake,  
- To see how soon  
  
Life, in its glories, glide away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay .  
  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide  
v Down which our fleeting moineuts glide  
  
Away so fast,  
. Let us the present hours employ,  
&#x27; And deem such future dreams a joy  
Already past. . ( ... ..  
Let no vain hopes deceive the mind ;  
-Ko happier lot hope lo find  
To-morrow than to-day :  
,. Our gulden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the future shall delight .  
Like them decay. .&#x27; : . &#x27; ; &#x27;  
v- &#x27; &#x27;  
- Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into one engulfing sea  
Are doomed to full  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on-&#x27;  
O&#x27;er king and kiugdom. crown and ihrone,  
- And swallow all. .  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide.  
Alike the humble rivulets glide  
To that sad wave !  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep 6ide by side  
Within the grave.  
Our birth is but a starting plucc;  
Life is the running of a race,  
And death the goal ;  
: There&#x27; all our glittering toys arc brought  
That path alone, of all unsought  
Is found of all.  
St&#x27;C, then, how poor and little worih  
Are all those glittering toys of eanh  
That luie us here ;  
Dreams of a sleep thnt doth must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
AVe disappear. -. 1 &#x27;  
Long ere the hand of death can blight,  
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
lias passed away.  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair  
Age came and laid his ringer there,  
Aud where are they?  
Where is the strength that spurns decay,  
The step that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe lone ?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joys grows wearisome and woe !

TIIE FOOTSTEPS &lt;0F DECAY.  
The following is a translation .from an ancient  
Spanish poem which, say* the Edinburgh Jlerietr,  
is surpassed by nothing with which we are ac­  
quainted in the Spanish language, except the Ode  
of Louis de Leon  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arouse its senses, and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
And while we view the rolling tide  
Down which our (lowing minutes glide

Let us the present hour employ, .  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.

No happier let us hope to find

Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into one engulfing *&lt;•*  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O&#x27;er kiog and kingdom, crowikaud throne,  
And swallow all.  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,  
To that sad wave !  
Death levels poverty and pride, •.  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
Our birth is but a starting place ;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys arc brought—  
That path alone, of all unsoaght,  
Is found of all.  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Arc all those glittering toys of earth  
, That lure us here ;  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas ! before it bids us awake,  
We disappear.  
Long ere the damp of death can blight

And where are they!  
Where is the strength that spurned decty,

PO ETICAL.  
THE FOOTSTEES OF DECAY.  
The following is a translation from an ancient  
Spanish poem which, says the Edinburgh Reviess, is  
surpassed by nothing with which we are acquainted  
in the Spanich language, except the Ode of Louis de  
Leon:  
Oh? let the soul its slumbers break-­  
Arouse its senses, and awake  
To see llow soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away.  
And the stern sootsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
And while we view the rolling tide  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast.  
Let ue the present hour employ.  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,  
No happier let us hope to find  
To morrow than to-day;  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight-  
Like them decay.  
Our lives like hastening dreams must be,  
That into one engulfing sea  
Are doomied to fall-  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
Alike the rit er&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble riv, let&#x27;s glide,  
To that sad wave!  
D ath levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor steep side by side  
Within the grave.  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
Lile is the running of the race.  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys are brought-  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
See, then how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth,  
That lure us here;  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us awake,  
We disappear.  
Long ere the damp of death can blight  
The cheek&#x27;s ture glow of red and white  
He passed away;  
Youth emiled, and all was heavenly fair;  
Age came, and laid his finger there,  
And where are they!  
Where is the strength that spurned decay.  
The etep that roved so light and gay;  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and woe!

HE ADVENTURES OF MARQUETTE.   
BY JOHN S, C. ABBOTT.   
Nearly three hundred and fifty years  
ago, in April, 1541, De Soto, in his ad­  
venturous march, discovered the majes­  
tic Mississippi, not far from the south­  
ern border of the State of Tennessee.  
No white man&#x27;s eye had ever before be­  
held that flood, whose banks are now  
inhabited by busy millions. The In­  
dians informed.him that all the region  
below consisted of dismal, endless, un­  
inhabitable swamps. De Soto, world­  
weary and woe-stricken, died upon the  
banks of the river, and in its fathomless  
depths his body found burial.   
These cruel adventurers, insanely im­  
pelled in search of mines of gold, found­  
ed no settlements, and left behind them  
no traces of their passage, save that by  
their cruelties they had excited the im­  
placable ire of the Indians against the  
white man. A hundred years of earth’s  
many griefs lingered slowly away, while  
these vast solitudes were peopled only  
by wandering Indian tribes whose record  
must forever remain unknown.   
in the year 1641, some French envoys  
from Canada, seeking to open friendly  
trade with the Indians for the purchase  
of furs, penetrated the northwest of our  
opnntry a* far as the Falls of St. Mary,  
near the outlet of Lake Superior. The  
most friendly relations existed between  
these Frenchmen and the Indians, wher­  
ever the tribes were encountered. This  
visit led to no settlement. The adven­  
turous traders purchased many furs,  
with which they loaded their birch  
canoes; established friendly

THE ADVENTURES OP MARQBETTE.  
BY JOHN 8. O. ABBOTT.  
Nearly three hundred and fifty years  
ago, in April, 1541, De Soto, in his ad­  
venturous march, discovered the majes­  
tic Mississippi, not far from the south­  
ern border of the State of Tennessee.  
No white man&#x27;s eye had ever before be­  
held that flood, whose banks are now  
inhabited by busy millions. The In­  
dians informed him that all the region  
below consisted of dismal, endless, un­  
inhabitable swamps. De Seto, world­  
weary and woe-stricken, died upon tke  
banks of the river, and in its fathomless  
depths his body found burial.  
These cruel adventurers, insanely im­  
peHecFiA search of mines of gold, found­  
ed no settlements, and left behind them  
no traces of their passage, save tbat by  
their cruelties they had excited the im­  
placable ire of the Indians against the  
white man. A hundred years of earth&#x27;s  
many griefs lingered slowly away, while  
these vast solitudes were peopled only  
by wandering Indian tribes whose record  
must forever remain unknown.  
In the year 1641, some French envoys  
from Canada, seeking to open friendly  
trade with the Indians for the purchase  
of fnrs, penetrated the northwest of our  
country far as the Falls of St. Mary,  
near the outlet of Lake Superior. The  
most friendly relations existed between  
these Frenchmen and the Indians, wher­  
ever the tribes were encountered. This  
visit led to no settlement. The adven­  
turous traders purchased many furs,  
with which they loaded their birch  
canoes ; established friendly

Life in Its glories glides away,  
And the stern lootsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
How pleasure like the passing wind  
Blows by and leares us nought behind^  
But grief at last;  
How still our present happiness  
Seems to our wayward (anry less  
Than what is just.  
Ahd while we view the rolling tide  
Down which our Bowing minutes glide  
Away so fast.  
Let ns the present hour employ,  
And deem each fntnre dream a joy  
Already past.  
Let no Tain hope deceire the mind ; e

To-morrow than to-day.  
Oor golden dieams of yore were bright:

Long ere the damp of death can blight

THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECAY.  
  
Oh &#x27; let the soul its slumber break—  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
  
To see how soon  
Life in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And when we view the rolling tide,  
Down which our floating minutes glide  
  
Avay so fast, :  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each futuce dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
  
Like the present shall delight—  
  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, where waves roll on  
Q&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all. 3  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulets glide,  
  
* To that sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but the starting place ;  
Life is the running of the race,  
  
And death the goal :  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
The path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
  
That lure us here!  
Dreams of a sieep that death must bregk,  
Alas &#x27; before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of earth can blight,  
Tue cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away  
Youth smiled, and ail was heavenly fair—-  
Age came and laid his finger there  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurns decay,  
The step that roved so light and gay,  
  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone ?  
The strength i= gone, the step is slow,  
  
The joy grows wearisome and woe!

{The following is a issustalion from an ancient Spanish  
poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by nothing  
with which we are acquainted in the Spanish language, except  
the “Ode of Lomis de Leon’’’ |  
  
LET the soul its slumbers break —  
Arouse its senses and awake  
9 To see how soon  
  
Life in its glories glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
  
  
  
  
And while we view the roiling tide  
Down which our flowing minutes glide,  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,  
  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day.  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright:  
Like them the present shall delight. -  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hastening streams must be  
That into one engulfing sea  
  
Are doomed to fall—  
  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on,  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
  
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,  
To that sad wave;  
  
Death leads poverty and pride,  
  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
  
Life is the running of the race;  
  
And death the goal;  
  
There all our glittering toys are bought.  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here;  
  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break;  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
  
Has passed away;  
  
Youth smiled and all was heavenly tair—  
Age came, and laid his finger there—  
  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The siep that roved so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and woe!  
When age comes on.
