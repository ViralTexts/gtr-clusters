The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish language, except the &quot;Ode of Luis de Leon.&quot;  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arounds its senses and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
Tomorrow, than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of Death, whose waves roll on  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulet&#x27;s glide  
To that sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride—  
The rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal:  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here!  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of earth can blight,  
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away:  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The steps that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and wo!  
When age comes on!

de Leon :—  
O! let the soul its slumber break,

And the stern footstep of decay  
Comes stealing on.

And while we eye the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flying minutes glide  
Away so fast ;

And deem each future dream of joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day,  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall;  
The Sea of Death, whose waves roll on,

That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
Say, then, how poor and little worth,

Long ere the damps of death can blight,  
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
Hath passed away:

And where are they ?  
  
Where are the strength that mock’d decay,  
The step that rose so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone ?—  
The strength is gone, the step is slow.  
And joy grows weariness and wo

The following is a translation from an ancient  
Spanish Poem, which, says the Edinburgh  
Review is surpassed by nothing which we  
are acquainted with in the Spanish lan­  
guage, except the Odes of Luis de Dcon.  
O ! let the soul its slumber break,  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon  
Life, with its glories, glides away,  
And the stem footsteps of decay  
Comes stealing on.  
How pleasure, like the passing wind,  
Blows by and leaves us nought behind  
But grief at last;  
How still our present happiness  
Seems, to the wayward fancy, less  
Than what is past.  
And while we eye the rolling tide,  
Down which our flying minutes glide  
Away so fast;  
. Let us the preseet hour employ,  
And deem each future dream of joy  
• Already past.  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into ooe engulfing sea  
Are doomed to fall;  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on,  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
Alike the river’s lordly tide, %  
Alike the humble rivulets glide  
To that sad wave ;  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
• • • • • »  
Our birth is but a starting place,  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal:  
There all our steps at last are brought,  
That path alone of all unsought,  
« Is found of all.  
Say, then, how poor and little worth,  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here;  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas before it bids us wake,  
Ye disappear.  
Long ere the damps of death can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Hath passed away.  
Youth smil’d and all was heavenly fair;  
Age came, and laid his finger there,  
And where are they&gt;  
Where is the strength that mock’d decay,  
The step that rose so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s light tone !—  
The strength is gone, the step is low,  
And joy grows weariness and woe  
When age comes on

And death the goal :

Say, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth

Alas! before it bids us wake,

Long ere the damp of death can blight

Age came, and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that rolled so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone ?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome and wo

Long ere the lampof death can blight,  
‘The cheeks pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
Yonth smiled, and all was heavenly fair;  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
And where are they!  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that rolled so light and gay,  
  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome and wo  
  
When age comes on.

{The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish  
Poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by  
nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish Lan-  
guage, except the odes of Lewis de Leon.)  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break,  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon  
Life like its glories glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we eye the rolling tide,  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast ;  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind —  
  
No happier let us hope to find,  
Tomorrow than today ;  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
  
Like them the present shall delight —  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulfing sea,  
Are doomed to fall —  
The sea of death whose waves roll on,  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble riv’let’s glide  
To that sad wave ;  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
‘ee  
Our birth is but a starting place ;  
Life is the running of the race :  
And death, the goal ;  
There all those glittering toys’are bought,  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
Say then how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth,  
That lure us here ?  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
Ye disappear !  
  
Long ere the lamp of death can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away ;  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair ;  
Age came and Jaid his finger there,  
And where are they ?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that rolled so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone %  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows weariness and wo  
When age comes on,

The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish  
poem, which, says the Edinburgh Review, is surpassed by  
nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish lan-  
guage except the ‘Ode of Louis De Leon.”  
  
  
  
O! xert the soul its slumbers break—  
Arouse its senses, and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,  
  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day;  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into one ingulfing sea:  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
  
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,  
To that sad wave!  
  
Death levels, poverty and pride,  
  
And rich and poor sleep side by side,  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but the starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys are bought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here;  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
Youth smiled and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came, and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and woe!  
When age comes on!

from tin ancient Spanish poem,  
which, says the Edinburg Review,  
is surpassed by nothing with  
which we are acquainted in the  
Spanish language, except the &#x27;Ode  
of Louis de Leon.”]  
Oh, let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arouse its senses, and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glide away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Como stealing on.  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fist,  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And d-em each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
Let i . n hope deceive the mind,  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day;  
Our gdd n dreams of yore were bright,  
Like th- ci the present shall delight —  
lake them decay.  
Our ii\! s like lasting streams must be  
That into the engulfing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O’er 1 mg and kingdom, crown and  
throne,  
And swallow all.  
.  
j. Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
I Alike the rivulet’s humble glide  
To that sad wave !  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
The rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
Our birth is but a starting place ;  
Life is but the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys are bought,  
The path alone, of all unsought.  
Is found of all.  
  
See, tlicr», how poor ami little worth  
Are all those gliteriug toys of earth  
That lure us here—  
Dreams of sleep that death must break ;  
Alas! uefore it bids us awake,  
We disappear.  
Long eio the damp emth can blight,

THE following is a translation tum ..  
ancient Spanish poem, which, says the  
Edinburgh Review, ‘is surpassed by nothing  
with which we are acquainted, in the Span-  
ish language, except the Odes of Louis De  
Leon”:  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumber break,  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon  
Life, with its glory, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
  
  
And while we eye the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream of joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind  
  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day.  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright ;  
  
Like them, the present shall delight—  
Like them, decay.  
  
Our lives, like hasting streams, must be,  
That into one engulfing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble riv’let’s glide  
To that sad wave ;  
Death levels property and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but the starting-place,  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal:  
There all those glittering toys are brought;  
The path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
Say, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those ogeaing toys of earth  
That lure us here ?  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas ! before it bids us wake,  
Ye disappear
