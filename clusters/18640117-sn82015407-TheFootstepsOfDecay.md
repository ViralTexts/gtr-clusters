The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish language, except the &quot;Ode of Luis de Leon.&quot;  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arounds its senses and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
Tomorrow, than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of Death, whose waves roll on  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulet&#x27;s glide  
To that sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride—  
The rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal:  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here!  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of earth can blight,  
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away:  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The steps that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and wo!  
When age comes on!

Fd vdetig Su ype the Edinburgh Re-  
view, is surpassed by nothing with which we  
‘are acquainted, in the Spanish language, e3-  
cept the Odes of Lewis de Leon :  
0! let the soul its slumber break,  
Arousé its senses, and awake,  
  
To see how soon  
Life with its glories glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay,  
  
Come sthaling on. *  
  
And while we eye the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Always so fast ;  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day ;  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
Gur lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulfing sea,  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death whose waves roll on,  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow ail.  
  
  
  
  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble riv’let’s glide  
To that sad wave.  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place ;  
Life is the running of the race ;  
And death the goal;  
There all those glittering toys are brought,  
That path alone; of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
Say then how poor and little worth  
  
Are all those glittering toys of earth,  
That lure us here?  
  
Preams of a sleep that death must break,  
  
‘Alas! before it bids us wake,

Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white

Youth smiled, and all was heaven fair ;  
Age came an laid his finger there,  
  
And where are&#x27;they ?  
  
Where is the strength th.t spurned decay,  
The step ‘hat rolled so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone ’  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows weariness and wo  
When age comes on.

Our birth is but a starting place ;  
Life is the running of the race;  
And death the goal ;  
There all those glittering toys are bought,  
That path alone, of all unsought,

Say then how poor and liitle worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth,

Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,

Where is the strength that spurned decay,

We disappear:  
  
Long ere the lampof death can blight,  
‘The cheeks pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
Yonth smiled, and all was heavenly fair;  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
And where are they!  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that rolled so light and gay,  
  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome and wo  
  
When age comes on.

The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne.  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide.  
  
Alike the riv’Iets lowly glide.  
  
To that sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride.  
  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place !  
  
Life is the running of the race.  
  
And death the goal;  
  
There, all those glittering toys are brought,  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
la found of all.  
  
I Say, then, how poor and little worth

And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that scorn’d decay.

The Course of Lire.  
Translated from the Spanish.  
O&#x27;let the Soul its slumbers break  
Arouse its senses and awake,  
To see how soon,  
Life, with its glories, glides away,  
And the stern foot-step of decay  
Comes stealing on.  
  
How pleasure, like the passing wind,  
Blows by, and leáves us nought behind  
But grief at last;  
How still our present happiness  
Seems, to the wayward fancy, less  
Than what is past.  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulfing sea  
Are doomed to fall;  
The Sea of Death, whose waves roll on,  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble riv&#x27;lets glide  
To the sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
Our birth is but the starting-place,  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal:  
There all our steps at last are brought,  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
Where is the strength that mocked decay,  
The step that rose so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?

preams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,

Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—

Alas! before it bids us wake,

Long ere the damp of death can blight,

And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,

The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish  
poem, which, says the Edinburgh Review, is surpassed by  
nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish lan-  
guage except the ‘Ode of Louis De Leon.”  
  
  
  
O! xert the soul its slumbers break—  
Arouse its senses, and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ,  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,  
  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day;  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hastening streams must be,  
That into one ingulfing sea:  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
  
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,  
To that sad wave!  
  
Death levels, poverty and pride,  
  
And rich and poor sleep side by side,  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but the starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal;  
There all our glittering toys are bought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here;  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
Youth smiled and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came, and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The step that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and woe!  
When age comes on!

See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away;  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly  
fair­  
Age came and laid his finger there  
And where are they?  
Where is the strength that spurned  
decay,  
The steps that roved so light and gay  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step&#x27;is slow  
And joy grows wearisome and woe  
When age comes on
