The following is a translation from an ancient Spanish poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by nothing with which we are acquainted in the Spanish language, except the &quot;Ode of Luis de Leon.&quot;  
  
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—  
Arounds its senses and awake  
To see how soon  
Life, in its glories, glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
And while we view the rolling tide,  
Down which our flowing minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
Let us the present hour employ,  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
Tomorrow, than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hasting streams must be,  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to fall—  
The sea of Death, whose waves roll on  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulet&#x27;s glide  
To that sad wave;  
Death levels poverty and pride—  
The rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
Life is the running of the race,  
And death the goal:  
There all our glittering toys are brought—  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here!  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of earth can blight,  
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white  
Has passed away:  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair—  
Age came and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The steps that roved so light and gay,  
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and wo!  
When age comes on!

The strength is gone, the step is low,

And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,

Seems to the wayward fancy, less  
Than wha; is past.  
And while we eye the rolling tide,  
Down which our fiying minutes glide  
Away so fast,  
Let us the present hour employ  
And deem each dream of future joy  
Already past.  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day.  
Our golden dreams of t ore were bright: J  
Like them the present shall delight—  
Like them to decay.  
Our lives like hasting streams must be, j  
That into one engulphing sea  
Are doomed to full;  
The Sea of Death, whose waves roll on,  
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
Alike the humble rivulets glide  
To tb it sad wave;  
Death levels property and pride,  
And rich and poor sleep side by side,  
Within the grave.  
Onr birth is but a starting place,  
Life is the running of the race;  
And death the goal;  
There all our steps at last are brought;  
That final path of all unsought,  
Is found of all.  
Long ere the dumps of earth can blight,  
The cheek’s pure glow of red aud white  
  
Hath passed away;  
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair;  
Age came, and laid his finger there,  
And where are they?  
Where is the strength that mocked decay,  
The step t.iat rose so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
The strength is gone, the step is slow  
Au l joy grows wearisome aad woe,  
When age comes on

That into one engulfing sea,  
Are doomed to fall,—  
The sea of Death, whose waves roll on  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.”

{The following is a issustalion from an ancient Spanish  
poem, which, says the Edinburg Review, is surpassed by nothing  
with which we are acquainted in the Spanish language, except  
the “Ode of Lomis de Leon’’’ |  
  
LET the soul its slumbers break —  
Arouse its senses and awake  
9 To see how soon  
  
Life in its glories glides away,  
And the stern footsteps of decay  
Come stealing on.  
  
  
  
  
  
And while we view the roiling tide  
Down which our flowing minutes glide,  
Away so fast,  
  
Let us the present hour employ  
  
And deem each future dream a joy  
Already past.  
  
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,  
  
No happier let us hope to find  
To-morrow than to-day.  
  
Our golden dreams of yore were bright:  
Like them the present shall delight. -  
Like them decay.  
  
Our lives like hastening streams must be  
That into one engulfing sea  
  
Are doomed to fall—  
  
The sea of death, whose waves roll on,  
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,  
And swallow all.  
  
Alike the river’s lordly tide,  
  
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,  
To that sad wave;  
  
Death leads poverty and pride,  
  
And rich and poor sleep side by side  
Within the grave.  
  
Our birth is but a starting place;  
  
Life is the running of the race;  
  
And death the goal;  
  
There all our glittering toys are bought.  
That path alone, of all unsought,  
  
Is found of all.  
  
See, then, how poor and little worth  
  
Are all those glittering toys of earth  
That lure us here;  
  
Dreams of a sleep that death must break;  
Alas! before it bids us wake,  
  
We disappear.  
  
Long ere the damp of death can blight,  
  
The cheek’s pure glow of red and white  
  
Has passed away;  
  
Youth smiled and all was heavenly tair—  
Age came, and laid his finger there—  
  
And where are they?  
  
Where is the strength that spurned decay,  
The siep that roved so light and gay,  
The heart’s blithe tone?  
  
The strength is gone, the step is slow,  
And joy grows wearisome, and woe!  
When age comes on.
