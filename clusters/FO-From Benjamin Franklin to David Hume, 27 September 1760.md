s such Abatement may be reasonable.  
I thank you for your friendly Admonition relating to some unusual Words in the Pamphlet. It will be of Service to me. The pejorate, and the colonize, since they are not in common use here, I give up as bad; for certainly in Writings intended for Persuasion and for general Information, one cannot be too clear, and every Expression in the least obscure is a Fault. The unshakeable too, tho’ clear, I give up as rather low. The introducing new Words where we are already possess’d of old ones sufficiently expressive, I confess must be generally wrong, as it tends to change the Language; yet at the same time I cannot but wish the Usage of our Tongue permitted making new Words when we want them, by Composition of old ones who Meanings are already well understood. The German allows of it, and it is a common Practice with their Writers. Many of our present English Words were originally so made; and many of the Latin Words. In point of Clearness such compound Words would have the Advantage of any we can borrow from the ancient or from foreign Languages. For instance, the Word inaccessible, tho’ long in use among us, is not yet, I dare say, so universally understood by our People as the Word uncomeatable would immediately be, which we are not allow’d to write. But I hope with you, that we shall always in America make the best English of this Island our Standard, and I believe it will be so. I assure you, it often gives me Pleasure to reflect how greatly the Audience (if I may so term it) of a good English Writer will in another Century or two be encreas’d, by the Increase of English People in our Colonies.  
My Son presents his Respects with mine to you and Dr. Monro. We receiv’d your print

tinent of North America, David Hume was  
specially struck with the following remark in  
one of Franklin’s letters to him in 1760 :—  
‘**T assure you it often gives me pleasure to  
reflect how greatly the audience (if I may so  
term it) of a good English writer will, in a  
century or two, be increased by the increase  
of English people in our colonies.” The result  
of reading this was to cause Hume to advance

After having received from Hume a copy of the Essay on  
Commerce, he wrote that it could not “but have a good  
effect in promoting a certain interest too little thought of by  
selfish man. I mean the interest of humanity, or common  
good of mankind.”
