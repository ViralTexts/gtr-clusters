On board the Pennsylvania Packet, Capt. Osborn at Sea,  
April 5. 1775.  
Suppose a Ship to make a Voyage Eastward from a Place in Lat: 40. North, to a Place in Lat 50. North, Distance in Longitude 75 Degrees.  
In sailing from 40 to 50 she goes from a Place where a Degree of Longitude is about 8 miles greater than in the Place she is going to. A Degree is equal to 4 Minutes of Time. Consequently the Ship in the Harbour she leaves partaking of the Diurnal Motion of the Earth, moves two miles in a minute faster, than when in the Port she is going to; which is 120 miles in an Hour.  
This motion in a Ship and Cargo is of great force; and if she could be lifted up suddenly from the Harbour in which she lay quiet, and set down instantly in the Latitude of the Port she was bound to, tho’ in a Calm, that Force contained in her would make her run a great Way at a Prodigious Rate. This Force must be lost gradually in her Voyage, by gradual Impulse against the water, and probably thence shorten the Voyage. In returning just the contrary must happen and her Voyage be retarded and lengthned.

*¢ Suppofe a fhip to make a voyage eaftward from a  
place in lat. 40° north, to a place in lat. 50° north, diftance  
in longitude 75 degrees.  
  
“In failing from 40 to 50, fhe goes from a place where  
a degree of longitude is about eight miles greater than in  
the place fhe is going to. A degree is equal to four mi-  
nutes of time; confequently the fhip in the harbour fhe  
leaves, partaking of the diurnal motion of the earth, moves  
two miles in a minute fafter, than when in the port fhe  
is going to; which is 120 miles in an hour,  
  
“ This motion in a fhip and cargo is of great force; and  
if fhe could be lifted up fuddenly from the harbour in  
which fhe lay quiet, and fet down inftantly in the latitude  
of the port fhe was bound to, though in a calm, that force  
contained in her would make her run a great way at a  
prodigious rate. This force muft be loft gradually in her  
voyage, by gradual impulfe againft the water, and proba-  
bly thence fhorten the voyage. Query, In returning does  
the contrary happen, and is her voyage thereby retarded  
and lengthened ?”
