his is speaking rather too positively, if there be, as I think there are, some other mediums that will convey it farther and more readily. It is a well-known experiment, that the scratching of a pin at one end of a long piece of timber, may be heard by an ear applied near the other end, though it could not be heard at the same distance through the air. And two stones being struck smartly together under water, the stroke may be heard at a greater distance by an ear also placed under water in the same river, than it can be heard through the air. I think I have heard it near a mile; how much farther it may be heard, I know not; but suppose a great deal farther, because the sound did not seem faint, as if at a distance, like distant sounds through air, but

go where no air can conveyit. Thus, scratching with a pin  
on one end of a long piece of timber, occasions a noise, that  
may be heard by an ear placed at the other end; although it  
could not be heard at the same distance through the air.—  
Two stones being struck together under water, may be  
heard, by an ear, also under water, in the same river, much  
further than the sound they afford, would be heard through  
the air. Dr. Franklin thinks he has heard it from the dis

ACOUSTIC TUNNELS.  
  
It Las been long known that wood is a good con¬  
ductor of sound. If a watch be laid on the one end  
of a long beam of timber, its beating will de distinct¬  
ly heard on applying the ear to the other end, though  
it could not be heard at the same distance through  
the air. In “ Nicholson’s Philosophical Journal,”  
for February, 1803, Mr. E. Walker describes a sim¬  
ple apparatus connected with a speaking trumpet, by  
means of w&#x27;liich, at the distance of 17 1-2 feet, he  
held a conversation with another in whispers too  
low to be heard through the air at that distance.  
When the ear was placed in a certain position, the  
words were heard as if they had been spoken by an  
invisible being within the trumpet. And what ren  
dered the deception still more pleasing, the words  
were more distinct, softer, and more musical than if  
they had been spoken through the air.
