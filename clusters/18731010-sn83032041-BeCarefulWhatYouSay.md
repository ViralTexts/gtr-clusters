In speaking of a person&#x27;s faults  
Pray don&#x27;t forget your own;  
Remember, those with homes of glass  
Should seldom throw a stone;  
If we have nothing else to do  
But talk of those who sin,  
&#x27;Tis better we commence at home,  
And from *that* point begin.  
  
We have no right to judge a man,  
Until he&#x27;s fairly tried;  
Should we not like his company,  
We know the world is wide;  
Some may have faults—and who have not—  
The old as well as young;  
Perhaps we may, for aught we know,  
Have fifty to their one.  
  
I&#x27;ll tell you of a better plan,  
And find it works full well;  
I try my own defects to cure  
Before of others tell;  
And though I sometimes hope to be  
No worse than some I know,  
My own shortcomings bid me let  
The faults of others go.  
  
Then let us all, when we commence  
To slander friend or foe,  
Think of the harm one word may do  
To those who little know;  
Remember, curses, sometimes like  
Our chickens, &quot;roost at home;&quot;  
Don&#x27;t speak of others&#x27; faults until
