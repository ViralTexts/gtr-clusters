In speaking of a person&#x27;s faults  
Pray don&#x27;t forget your own;  
Remember, those with homes of glass  
Should seldom throw a stone;  
If we have nothing else to do  
But talk of those who sin,

And from *that* point begin.  
  
We have no right to judge a man,  
Until he&#x27;s fairly tried;  
Should we not like his company,  
We know the world is wide;  
Some may have faults—and who have not—  
The old as well as young;  
Perhaps we may, for aught we know,  
Have fifty to their one.  
  
I&#x27;ll tell you of a better plan,  
And find it works full well;  
I try my own defects to cure  
Before of others tell;  
And though I sometimes hope to be  
No worse than some I know,  
My own shortcomings bid me let  
The faults of others go.

find that, while in. dividuals who are
