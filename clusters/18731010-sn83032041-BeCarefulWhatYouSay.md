In speaking of a person&#x27;s faults  
Pray don&#x27;t forget your own;  
Remember, those with homes of glass  
Should seldom throw a stone;  
If we have nothing else to do  
But talk of those who sin,  
&#x27;Tis better we commence at home,  
And from *that* point begin.  
  
We have no right to judge a man,  
Until he&#x27;s fairly tried;  
Should we not like his company,  
We know the world is wide;  
Some may have faults—and who have not—  
The old as well as young;  
Perhaps we may, for aught we know,  
Have fifty to their one.  
  
I&#x27;ll tell you of a better plan,  
And find it works full well;  
I try my own defects to cure  
Before of others tell;  
And though I sometimes hope to be  
No worse than some I know,  
My own shortcomings bid me let  
The faults of others go.  
  
Then let us all, when we commence  
To slander friend or foe,  
Think of the harm one word may do  
To those who little know;  
Remember, curses, sometimes like  
Our chickens, &quot;roost at home;&quot;  
Don&#x27;t speak of others&#x27; faults until

AEICULTURAL NOTES.  
Petroleum on Shingtit,  
lu regard to applying petroleum to  
shingles to preserve them, a writer say:  
“It enters the pores of the wood at  
once, and as it hardens makes it more  
compact in texture, and rather less  
liable to take fire. The petroleum also  
prevents the surface of the shingles  
from rising in downy fibres, or ‘ fuz, ’  
and it is on the whole not so liable to  
fire from sparks when treated with it.  
We have tried the experiment with  
shingles oiled some time previously,  
and find they are not so easily ignited  
by outside tire, altough when once  
burning they will, of course, produce  
more flame than the wood without the  
petroleum.” Petroleum is also very­  
good to apply to the iron work and  
steel of farm implements, to prevent  
their rusting wheu not in use. The  
crude article costs but $3 or per bar­  
rel—the price may be higher at pres­  
ent—and it is useful to keep on hand.  
When any out-building, or even your  
dwelling-house, is to be painted, one­  
half the expense may be saved by ap­  
plying a coat of petroleum with a fine  
whitewash brush; let it dry several  
weeks, and then put on one coat of  
paint, and, by so doing a second coat  
of paint is rendered unnecessary.  
Water for the Poultry.  
Neglect of any kind has its penalty, es­  
pecially in the management of poultry.  
During the cold weather there should  
be a regular supply of pure water fur­  
nished, and it should not be cold.  
Fowls like to drink often, and they con­  
sume as much water in proportion to  
the weight of their bodies as horses and  
domestic animals. Very cold water  
chills the body and retards the produc­  
tion of eggs.  
It is a notable fact that many farm­  
ers and small breeders neglect giving  
water to their fowls, forcing them to  
eat snow and ice; and in such cases  
there is not only lack of thrift, but  
downright suffering, and, very likely,  
disease follows.  
If warm water is provided, by using  
some approved drinking fountain, by  
which an even temperature is obtained,  
there is no more trouble through the  
day; but if not, the water should be  
supplied warm in the morning and  
again at noon. Warm water and warm  
food make the fowls comfortable.  
They never lay eggs unless in a com­  
fortable condition. It takes much ani­  
mal heat to melt ice in the crop. Very­  
cold water retards the digestion of food,  
and prevents, in some measure, that  
stimulating and nourishing effect  
which is desirable in the production of  
egg s or fattening of the fowls.—Poultry  
World.  
  
Destruction of Weeds.  
If land is overrun with weeds it will  
not produce heavy crops of cereals,  
grasses, roots or legumos. The major­  
ity of farmers suffer heavy losses by al­  
lowing weeds to encroach on their cul­  
tivated crops and rob them of their  
necessary food, by absorbing the best  
ingredients of the soil. By deep plow­  
ing grass and weeds may be so effect­  
ively turned under that they will rot  
and turn into manure, and by repeat­  
edly harrowing the surface soil with an  
implement capable of doing the work  
in the best way all roots and vegetating  
seeds of weeds that lie within three or  
four inches of the surface will be  
brought up and killed by exposure to  
the sun. A rotation of crops has a  
powerful effect in destroying weeds, for  
where dried crops are alternated with  
cereals the frequent stirring of the soil  
in the after-culture of the drilled crops  
prevents the growth of weeds, and  
makes the soil perfectly clean.—De­  
troit Post.  
Feed for Young Calves.  
The first winter is proverbially a try­  
ing time for young stock of all kinds  
There is no sorrier sight than the aver­  
age yearling cattle found in late winter  
and spring in most northern barnyards.  
A spring calf, that has been once wean­  
ed from milk and taught to eat grass,  
is a second time forced to a change of  
food, and that usually which has no  
sweetness or succulence. Dry and  
often “ woody ” hay is ot very nour­  
ishing food, and what nutrition it con­  
tains is of little value for a young calf.  
Well cured early mown clover is prob­  
ably as nearly like succulent grass as  
can be found in the shape of hay; out  
if young oalves are to be kept thriving  
they need something more. 1 have  
found nothing better than oatmeal as  
feed for young growing calves. A small  
handful of ground oats thoroughly  
scalded with boiling water may be  
mixed with their mess of skim milk  
• when the calf is a few days old, and  
water may be gradually substituted for  
the milk if the latter is scarce. The  
| scalded oatmeal partially cooks the  
milk,forming a mucilaginous porridge  
which the animal will eat with avidity.  
I never knew a calf thus reared which  
did not become a vigorous thrifty ani­  
mal, which is especially important in a  
cow. It is impossible for any cow to  
become a good milker unless she is  
also a hearty feeder; and a little oat­  
meal during the first year of an animal’s  
existence is pretty sure to establish that  
habit for life. The oatmeal promotes  
I growth of frame and bone rather than  
i increase of fat; and it is important that  
I calves which are intended to be raised  
as cows should have food which pro­  
motes fleeh and growth Bather than fat.  
In some cases I have known one or two  
quarts of oatmeal to be fed per day  
during the second winter, while the  
same amount of corn meal would have  
only fitted the animals for the shambles.  
It is not necessary to buy the fine oat­  
meal which is sold at the stores and  
costs five or six cents per pound. A  
few bushels coarsely ground in any  
custom mill will prove equally good  
and much cheaper. Of coarse where  
animals are to be fattened corn is pre­  
ferable at present prices; but even now  
there is nothing for growing stock  
cheaper or better than ground oau.—  
Prairie Farmer.  
Planting Forest Tree*.  
At a meeting of the New York Far­  
mer’s Club, recently held at Utica, dur­  
ing a discussion on the culture of forest  
trees, Daniel Bachelor said: The per­  
son who desires to successfully plant  
evergreen trees should go to the out­  
skirts of a forest; select as many young i  
evergreens as possible; plant, and leave  
at least a year.in drills, daring which |  
time the tree will send out lateral roots,  
and at the end of which it can safely he i  
  
I  
removed. This course should be fol­  
lowed eitner in the case of evergreens  
or deciduous trees. Evergreens will  
die quickly when out of the ground  
with roots exposed to the air. ,  
To illustrate the truth of this, Mr.  
Bonfoy said that he once pulled up 300  
hemlock trees to transplant them; he  
piled them on wagons, watered them  
thoroughly, and covered them with  
blankets. Sixty were set out before  
noon, and the rest two or three hours  
later. More than half of the latter  
died, while all the others lived.  
Hemlock and cedars should be se­  
lected from the edge of the wood. The  
time of year they are set makes no  
difference in their living, if the roots  
are well cared for, and have not frozen  
or dried. If much depends upon the  
nature of the season, still more depends  
on the care of the roots. These trees  
must not be boxed (as they will heat iu  
boxes) nor sent long distances. They  
should be transplanted on a moist,  
cloudy day, as it is difficult to do so in  
hot, dry weather. The sap is glutinous  
and the tree therefore dies easily out  
of ground.  
The Honne.  
Stewed Beefsteak.—Slice and fry  
four onions in butter; put them in a  
stew-pan; cut the steak in go u-sized  
pieces and fry; pepper and sat. it; put  
in the pan and cover it with water, let­  
ting it simmer slowly for two hours.  
.Potato Croquettes.—Add to cold  
mashed potatoes a little salt, white  
pepper, nutmeg, minced parsley, and  
beaten egg sufficient to make them  
stick together; form into oval balls,  
dip in beaten egg, then in sifted bread  
crumbs, and fry in hot lard or clear  
drippings.  
Boston Brown Bread.—One quart  
yellow Indian meal, one quart rye  
meal, one cupful yeast, one cupful  
New Orleans molasses, one heaping  
spoonful of soda; steam three hours,  
then put in the oven for one-half hour.  
One-half the quantity makes a good­  
sized loaf.  
Potato Pie Crust.—Put a teacupful  
of rich sweet cream to six good sized  
potatoes after they have been well  
boiled and mashed fine. Add salt to  
taste, and flour enough to roll out the  
crust. Handle it as little as possible  
This waste is excellent for apple dump­  
ling or meat pies, and may be eaten by  
the most confirmed dyspeptic,  
Norwegian Codfish.—Soak properly.  
When soaked and ready to begin  
cooking, flake the fish and carefully  
remove bones. Put in a saucepan  
sufficient quantity in equal parts of  
lard and olive oil; then heat, and into  
hot grease put a sufficient quantity of  
garlic and onions cut in small pieces.  
When the edges of the garlic turn  
brown, put in the codfish and add an  
equal quantity of canned tomatoes,  
and stew slowly three or four hours.  
Half an hour before serving, stir in  
one or two heaping tablespoonfuls of  
pimento.  
Mutton Soup.—Take the fore-quar­  
ter of mutton, cut out the bone from  
the shoulder, and put it down to boil  
in two quarts of water; as soon aa it  
boils, skim it well; set it where it will  
keep simmering for an hour; then  
add the meat, also more boiling water;  
skim again as soon as any scum rises;  
grate one good-sized carrot, chop three  
onions, three yellow turnips, and some  
celery quite small, and add to the  
soup; boil slowly five hours; soak a  
cupful of rice or barley, according to  
taste, in some tepid water, and add to  
the meat; season with the grated rind  
of a lemon, a little chopped parsley,  
salt and pepper, and a sprinkle of nut­  
meg  
New England Baked Beans —Put a  
quart of good white beaus in three or  
four quarts of soft water let them  
stand where they will get hot but not  
boil for twelve hours at least, then  
drain them thoroughly and rinse  
through several waters; place in a  
deep pot; score the rind of a pound  
of nice fat pork deeply, and place it  
in the beans so that it will be all  
covered except the rind, and cover  
with water; place in a hot oven and  
bake ten or twelve hours—more is bet­  
ter; as the water dries away till it up  
again, and sometimes put a teaspoon­  
ful of molasses in the water; the rind  
should be crisp and cracky, and beans  
reddish brown and soft, but whole  
when done.

AGRICULTURAL NOTES.  
Petroleum on Siiingies.  
In regard to applying petroleum to  
shingles to preserve them, a writer says:  
“It enters the pores of the wood at  
once, and as it hardens makes it more  
compact in texture, and rather less  
liable to take fire. The petroleum also  
prevents the surface of the shingles  
from rising in downy fibres, or ‘ fuz, ’  
and it is on the whole not so liable to  
fire from sparks when treated with it.  
We have tried the experiment with  
shingles oiled some time previously,  
and find they are not so easily igaited  
by outside tire, altough when once  
burning they will, of course, produce  
more flame than the wood without the  
petroleum.” Petroleum is also very  
good to apply to the iron work and  
steel of farm implements, to prevent  
their rusting when not in use. The  
crude article costs but $3 or $4 per bar­  
rel—the price may be higher at pres­  
ent—and it is useful to keep on hand.  
When any out-building, or even your  
dwelling-house, is to be painted, one­  
half the expense may be saved by ap­  
plying a coat of petroleum with a fane  
whitewash brush; let it dry several  
weeks, and then put on one coat of  
paint, and, by so doing a second coat  
of paint is rendered unnecessary.  
Water lor the Poultry,  
NegU&#x27;&#x27; -of any kind has its penalty, es­  
pecially in the management of poultry.  
During the cold weather there should  
be a regular supply of pure wrater fur­  
nished, and it should not be cold.  
Fowls like to drink often, and they con­  
sume as muck water in proportion to  
the weight of their bodies as horses and  
domestic animals. Very cold water  
chills the body and retards the produc­  
tion of eggs.  
It is a notable fact that many farm­  
ers and small breeders neglect giving  
water to their fowls, forcing them to  
eat snow and ice; and in such cases  
there is not only lack of thrift, but  
downright suffering, and, very likely,  
disease follows.  
If warm water is provided, by using  
some approved drinking fountain, by  
which an even temperature is obtained,  
there is no more trouble through the  
day; but if not, the water should be  
supplied warm in tbe morning and  
again at noon. Warm water and warm  
food make the fowls comfortable.  
They never lay eggs unless in a com­  
fortable condition. It takes much ani­  
mal heat to melt ice in the crop. Very  
cold water retards the digestion of food,  
and prevents, in some measure, that  
stimulating and nourishing effect  
which is desirable in the production of  
eggs or fattening of the fowls.—Poultry  
World.  
Destruction of Weeds.  
If land is overrun with weeds it will  
not produce heavy crops of cereals,  
grasses, roots or legumos. The major­  
ity of farmers suffer heavy losses by al­  
lowing weeds to encroach on their cul­  
tivated crops and rob them of their  
necessary food, by absorbing the best  
ingredients of the soil. By deep plow­  
ing grass and weeds may be so effect­  
ively turned under that they will rot  
and turn into manure, and by repeat­  
edly harrowing the surface soil with an  
implement capable of doing the work  
in the best way all roots and vegetating  
seeds of weeds that lie within three or  
four inches of the surface will be  
brought up and killed by exposure to  
the sun. A rotation of crops has a  
powerful effect in destroying weeds, for  
where dried crops are alternated with  
cereals the frequent stirring of the soil  
in the after-culture of the drilled crops  
prevents the growth of weeds, and  
makes the soil perfectly clean.—De­  
troit Post.  
  
Feed for Young Calves,  
The first winter is proverbially a try­  
ing time for young stock of all kinds.  
There is no sorrier sight than the aver­  
age yearling cattle found in late winter  
and spring in most northern barnyards.  
A spring calf, that has been once wean­  
ed from milk and taught to eat grass,  
is a second time forced to a change of  
food, and that usually which has no  
sweetness or succulence. Dry and  
often “ woody ” hay is not very nour­  
ishing food, and what nutrition it con­  
tains is of little value for a young calf.  
Well cured early mown clover is prob­  
ably as nearly like succulent grass as  
can be found in the shape of hay; but  
if young calves are to be kept thriving  
they need something more. I have  
found nothing better than oatmeal as  
feed for young growing calves. A. small  
handful of ground oats thoroughly  
scalded with boiling water may be  
mixed with their mess of skim milk  
when the calf is a few days old, and  
water may be gradually substituted for  
the milk if the latter is scarce. The  
scalded oatmeal partially cooks the  
milk, forming a mucilaginous porridge  
which the animal will eat with avidity.  
I never knew a calf thus reared which  
did not become a vigorous thrifty ani­  
mal, which is especially important in a  
cow. It is impossible for anv cow to  
become a good milker unless she is  
also a hearty feeder; and a little oat­  
meal during the first year of an animal’s  
existence is pretty sure to establish that  
habit for life. The oatmeal promotes  
growth of frame and bone rather than  
  
increase of fat; and it is important that  
calves which are intended to be raised  
as cows should -have food which pro­  
motes flesh and growth rather than fat.  
In some cases I have known one or two  
quarts of oatmeal to be fed per day  
during the second winter, while the  
same amount of corn meal would have  
only fitted the animals for the shambles.  
It is not necessary to buy the fine oat­  
meal which is sold at the stores and  
coats five or six cents per pound. A  
few bushels coarsely ground in any  
custom mill will prove equally good  
and much cheaper. Of course where  
animals are to be fattened corn is pre­  
ferable at present prices; but even now  
there is nothing for growing stock  
cheaper or better than ground oats.—

skirts of a forest; select as many young  
evergreens as possible; plant, and leave  
at least a year in drills, during which  
time the tree will send out lateral roots,  
and at the end of which it can safely be  
removed. This course should be fol­  
lowed either in the case of evergreens  
or deciduous trees. Evergreens will  
die quickly when out of the ground  
with roots exposed to the air.  
To illustrate the truth of this, Mr.  
Bonfoy said that he once pulled up 300  
hemlock trees to transplant them; he  
piled them on wagons, watered them  
thoroughly, and covered them with  
blankets. Sixty were set out before  
noon, and the rest two or three hours  
later. More than half of the latter  
died, while all the others lived.  
  
Hemlock and cedars should be se­  
lected from the edge of the wood. The  
time of year they are set makes no  
difference in their living, if the roots  
are well cared for, and have not frozen  
or dried. If much depends upon the  
nature of the season, still more depends  
on the care of the roots. These trees  
must not be boxed (as they will heat in  
boxes) nor sent long distances. They  
should be transplanted on a moist,  
cloudy day, as it is difficult to do so in  
hot, dry weather. The sap is glutinous  
and the tree therefore dies easily out  
of ground.  
  
The House.  
  
Stewed Beefsteak.—Slice and fry  
four onions in butter; put them in a  
stew-pan; cut the steak in good-sized  
pieces and fry; pepper and salt it; put  
in the pan and cover it with water, let­  
ting it simmer slowly for two hours.  
Potato Croquettes.—Add to cold  
mashed potatoes a little salt, white  
pepper, nutmeg, minced parsley, and  
beaten egg sufficient to make them  
stick together; form into oval balls,  
dip in beaten egg, then in sifted bread  
crumbs, and fry in hot lard or clear  
drippings.  
Boston Brown Bread.—One quart  
yellowT Indian meal, one quart rye  
meal, one cupful yeast, one cupful  
New Orleans molasses, one heaping  
spoonful of soda; steam three hours,  
then put in the oven for one-half hour.  
One-half the quantity makes a good­  
sized loaf.  
  
Potato Pie Crust.—Put a teacupful  
of rich sweet cream to six good-sized  
potatoes after they have been well  
boiled and mashed fine. Add salt to  
taste, and flour enough to roll out the  
crust. Handle it as little as possible.  
This waste is excellent for apple dump­  
ling or meat pies, and may be eaten by  
the most confirmed dyspeptic.  
Norwegian Codfish.—Soak properly.  
When soaked and ready to begin  
cooking, flake the fish and carefully  
remove bones. Put in a sauce-pan  
sufficient quantity in equal parts of  
lard and olive oil; then heat, and into  
hot grease put a sufficient quantity of  
garlic and onions cut in small pieces.  
When the edges of the garlic turn  
brown, put in the codfish and add an  
equal quantity of canned tomatoes,  
and stew slowly three or four hours.  
Half an hour before serving, stir in  
one or two heaping tablespoonfuls of  
pimento.  
Mutton Soup.—Take the fore-quar­  
ter of mutton, cut out the bone from  
the shoulder, and put it down to boil  
in two quarts of water; as soon as it  
boils, skim it well; set it where it will  
keep simmering for an hour; then  
add the meat, also more boiling water;  
skim again as soon as any scum rises;  
grate one good-sized carrot, chop three  
onions, three yellow turnips, and some  
celery quite small, and add to the  
soup; boil slowly five hours; soak a  
cupful of rice or barley, according to  
taste, in some tepid water, and add to  
the meat; season with the grated rind  
of a lemon, a little chopped parsley,  
salt and pepper, and a sprinkle of nut­  
meg  
  
New England Baked Beans.—Put a  
quart of good white bsans in three or  
four quails of soft water let them  
stand where they will get hot but not  
boil for twelve hours at least, then  
drain them thoroughly and rinse  
through several waters; place in a  
deep pot; score the rind of a pound  
of nice fat pork deeply, and place it  
in the beans so that it will be all  
covered except the rind, and cover  
with water; place in a hot oven and  
bake ten cr twelve hours—more is bet­  
ter; as the water dries away fill it up  
again, and sometimes put a teaspoon­  
ful of molasses in the water; the rind  
should be crisp and cracky, and beans  
reddish brown and soft, but whole  
when done.

AGRICULTURAL NOTES.  
  
Petroleum on SUngies.  
  
In regard to applying petroleum to  
shingles to preserve them, a writer says:  
It enters the pores of the wood at  
once, and as it hardens makes it more  
compact in texture, and rather less  
liable to take fire. The petroleum also  
prevents the surface of the shingles  
from rising in downy fibres, or fuz,&#x27;  
and it is on the whole not so liable to  
fire from sparks when treated with it.  
We have tried the experiment with  
shingles oiled some time previously,  
and find they are not so easily ignited  
by outside fire, altough when onoe  
burning they will, of course, produoe  
more flame than the wood without the  
petroleum.&quot; Petroleum is also very  
good to apply to the iron work and  
steel of form implements, to prevent  
their rusting when not in use. The  
crude article costs but $3 or $4 per bar­  
rel—the price may be higher at pres*  
ent—and it is useful to keep on hand.

World.  
  
Feed t»r Young Calves.  
  
The first winter is proverbially &amp; try­  
ing time for young stock of all kinds&#x27;  
There is no sorrier sight than the aver­  
age yearling cattle found in late winter  
and spring in most northern barnyardB.  
A spring calf, that has been onee-weaa­  
ed from milk and taught to eat grkar,  
ia a second time forced to a change of  
food, and that usually which has no  
sweetness or succulenc^ Dry and  
often woody hay is not very nour­  
ishing food, and what nutrition it con­  
tains is of little value for a young calf.  
Well cured early mown clover is prob­  
ably as nearly like succulent grass as  
can be found in the shape of hay but  
if young calves are to be kept thriving  
they need something more. I have  
found nothing better than oatmeal as  
feed for young growing calves. A small  
handful of ground oats thoroughly  
scalded with boiling water may be  
mixed with their mess of skim milk  
when the calf is a few days old, and  
water may be gradually substituted for  
the rttilk if the latter is scarce. The  
scalded oatmeal partially cooks Jhe  
milk, forming a mucilaginous porrrage  
which the animal will eat with avidity.  
I never knew a calf thuB reared which  
did not become a vigorous thrifty ani­  
mal, which is especially important in a  
cow. It is impossible for any cow to  
become a good milker unless she is  
also a hearty feeder and a little oat­  
meal during the first year of an animal&#x27;s  
existence is pretty sure to establish that  
habit for life. Tne oatmeal promotes  
growth of frame and bone rather than  
increase of fat and it is important that  
calves which are intended to be raised  
as cows should have food which pro­  
motes flesh and growth rather than fat.  
In some cases I have known one or two  
quarts of oatmeal to be fed per day  
during the second winter, while the  
game amount of corn meal would have  
only fittedtheanimalsfortheshambles.  
It is not necessary to buy the fine oat­  
meal which is sold at the stores and  
costs five or .six cents per pound. A  
few bushels coarsely ground in any  
custom mill will prove equally good  
and much cheaper. Of course where  
animals are to &amp; fattened corn is pre­  
ferable at present prices but even now  
there is nothing for growing stock  
cheaper or better than ground oats.—

Planting Forest Trees.  
  
&quot;At a meeting of the New York Far­  
mer&#x27;s Club, recently held at Utica, dur­  
ing a discussion on the culture of forest  
trees, Daniel Bachelor said: The per­

Destructlonof Weeds.  
  
If land is overrun with weeds it will  
hot produce heavy crops of cereals,  
grasses, roots or legumoe* The major­  
ity of farmers suffer heavy losses by al­  
lowing weeds to encroach on their cul­  
tivated crops and rob them of their

and turn into manure, and by repeat­  
edly h^rrowhig ihe surfaoe soil with an  
implement capable of doing the work  
in the best way all roots and vegetating  
seeds of weeds that lie within three or  
four inches of the surface will be  
brought up and killed by exposure to  
the sun. A rotation of crops has a  
powerful effect in destroying weeds for  
where dried crops are alternated with:  
cereals the frequent stirring of the soil  
in the after-culture of the drilled crops  
prevents the growth of weeds, and  
makes the soil perfectly clean.—De­
