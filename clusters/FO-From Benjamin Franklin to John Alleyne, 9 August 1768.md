ces to mutual Happiness) is an Addition to that Pleasure. Had you consulted me, as a Friend, on the Occasion, Youth on both sides I should not have thought any Objection. Indeed from the Matches that have fallen under my Observation, I am rather inclined to think that early ones stand the best Chance for Happiness. The Tempers and Habits of young People are not yet become so stiff and uncomplying as when more advanced in Life, they form more easily to each other, and thence many Occasions of Disgust are removed. And if Youth has less of that Prudence that is necessary to manage a Family, yet the Parents and elder Friends of young married Persons are generally at hand to afford their Advice, which amply supplies that Defect; and by early Marriage, Youth is sooner form’d to regular and useful Life, and possibly some of those Accidents Habits or Connections that might have injured either the Constitution or the Reputation, or both, are thereby happily prevented. Particular Circumstances of particular Persons may possibly sometimes make it prudent to delay entering into that State, but in general when Nature has render’d our Bodies fit for it, the Presumption is in Nature’s Favour, that she has not judg’d amiss in making us desire it. Late Marriages are often attended too with this farther Inconvenience, that there is not the same Chance the Parents shall live to see their offspring educated. Late Children, says the Spanish Proverb, are early Orphans: A melancholly Reflection to those whose Case it may be! With us in N. America, Marriages are generally in the Morning of Life, our Children are therefore educated and settled in the World by Noon, and thus our Business being done, we have an Afternoon and Evening of chearful Leisure to our selves, such as your Friend at present enjoys. By these early Marriages we are blest with more Children, and from the Mode among us founded in Nature of every Mother suckling and nursing her own Child, more of them are raised. Thence the swift Progress of Population among us unparallel’d in Europe. In fine, I am glad you are married, and congratulate you cordially upon it. You are now more in the way of becoming a useful Citizen; and you have escap’d the unnatural State of Celibacy for Life, the Fate of many here who never intended it, but who having too long postpon’d the Change of their Condition, find at length that ’tis too late to think of it, and So live all their Lives in a Situation that greatly lessens a Man’s Value: An odd Volume of a Set of Books, you know, is not worth its proportion of the Set; and what think you of the Usefulness of an odd Half of a Pair of Scissars? It cannot well cut any thing. It may possibly serve to scrape a Trencher.  
Pray make my Compliments and best Wishes acceptable to your Spouse. I am old and heavy, and grow a little indolent,  or I should ere this have presented them in Person. I shall make but small Use of the old Man’s Privilege, that of giving Advice to younger Friends. Treat your Wife always with Respect. It will procure Respect to you, not from her only, but from all that observe it. Never use a slighting Expression to her even in jest; for Slights in Jest after frequent bandyings, are apt to end in angry earnest. Be studious in your Profession, and you will be learned. Be industrious and frugal, and you will be rich. Be sober and temperate and you will be healthy. Be in general virtuous, and you will be happy. At least you will by such Conduct stand the best Chance for such Consequences. I pray God to bless you both, being ever Your truly affectionate Friend

Dr. Franklin’s Opinion “of ‘early “Marriages.  
  
gafe it may be! With us in America,  
marriages are generafly in the morning  
of life, our children are, therefore edu-  
  
cated and fettled in the world by noon ; .  
  
and thus our bufinefs being done, we  
have an afternoon and evening of chear-  
ful leifure to ourfelves, fuch as your  
friend at prefent enjoys. By thefe early  
marriages we are bleft with more chil-  
dren; and from the mode. among us,  
founded in nature, of every mother  
fuckling and nurfing her own child,  
more of them are raifed. Thence the  
{wift progrefs of population among us,  
unparalleled in Europe !—In fine, I am  
glad you are married, and congratulate  
you moft cordially upon it, You are  
now in the way of becoming a ufeful  
citizen, and you have efcaped the unna-  
tural ftate of celibacy for life, the fate  
of many here who never intended it,  
but who, having too long poltponed the  
change of their condition, find at  
length that it is too late to think of it,  
and fo live all their lives in a fituation  
that greatly leffens a man’s value.—An  
odd volume of a fett of books, you  
know, is not worth its proportion of the  
fett: and what think you of the odd  
half of a pair of {ciffars ?—it can’t well  
gut any thing—it may poffibly ferve to  
fcrape a trencher,  
  
Pray make my compliments and beft  
wifhes acceptable to your bride. I am  
gid and heavy, or I fhould, ere this,  
have prefented them in perfon. I fhali  
make but fmall ufe of the old man’s  
privilege, that of giving advice to  
younger friends.—Treat your wife al-  
ways with refpe&amp;; it will procure re-

om all that obferve it. Never ule a  
flighting expreffion to her, even in jett ;  
for flights in jeft, after frequent bandy-  
ings, are apt to end in angry earnelt.—  
Be ftudious in your profetiion, and you  
wil] be learned. Be induftiious and  
frugal, and you will be rich. Be fober  
  
and temperate, and you will be healthy.)  
  
Be in general virtuous, and you will be

who, having too long postponed the change of

Treat your wife always with refpeift; it will pro­

You may remember, when you confult-  
ed me on the occafion, that I thoughr  
youth on both fides to be no objeétion.  
Indeed, from the marriages which have

when more advanced in life ; they form  
more eafily to each other ; and hence  
many occafions of difguft are removed.  
And if youth has lefs of that prudence,  
which is neceflary to manage a family—  
yet the parents and elder friends of  
young married perfons are generally at  
hand, to afford their advice, which am-  
ply fupplies that defett: and by early  
marriage, youth is fooner formed to re-  
gular and ufeful life ; and pofibly fome  
of thofe accidents or connexions, that  
might have injured the conftituuon, or  
reputation, or both, are thereby hap-  
pily prevented. Particular circumitan-  
ces, of particular perfons, may poffibly  
fometimes make it prudent to delay en-  
tering into that ftate ; but in general  
when nature has rendered our bodies fit  
for it, the prefumption is in nature’s fa-  
vour, that fhe has not judged amifs in

are often attended, too, with this fur-

ON MARRIAGE.  
  
By Dr. Franklin, in aletter to a Friend.  
ParTICULAR circumstances of particular persons may  
possibly sometimes make it prudent to delay entering into  
that [the marriage] state; but, in general, when nature  
has rendered our bodies fit for it, the presumption is in  
nature’s favour, that she bas not judged amiss in making  
us desire it. Late marriages are often attended, too, with  
this further inconvenience, that there is not the same  
chance that the parents shall live to see their offspring  
educated.—* Late children,’ says the Spanish proverb,  
«are early orphans ;’ a melancholy reflection to those  
whose case it may be! With us in America, marriages  
  
  
  
——.  
  
are generally in the morning of life; our children are  
therefore educated and settled in the world by noon; and  
thus, our business being done, we have an afternoon and  
evening of cheerful leisure to ourselves, such as our friend  
at present enjoys. By these early marriages we are blessed  
with more children; and from the mode amone us  
founded by nature, of every mother suckling and ‘purse  
ing her own child, more of them are raised.—Thence the  
swift progress of population among us, unparalleled jp  
Europe. In fine, Tam glad you are married, and con.  
gratulate you most cordially upon it. You are now in the  
way of becoming a useful citizen, and you have escaped  
the unnatural state of celibacy for life—the fate of many  
here who never intended it, but who, having too lon  
postponed the change of their condition, find at length  
that it is too late to think of it, and so live all their ; ie  
in a situation that greatly lessens a man’s value. An odd  
volume of a set of books bears not the value of its propor-  
tion to the set. What think you of the odd half of a pair  
of scissors? It can’t well cut any thing. It may possibly  
serve to scrape a trencher.  
  
Pray make my compliments and best wishes acceptable  
to your bride. 1 am old and heavy, or [ should, ere this,  
have presented them in person. I shall make but small  
use of the old man’s privilege, that of giving advice to

all that observe it. Never use a slighting expression to

under my observation, 1 am rather inclined to  
think that early ones stand the best chance for  
happiness. The tempers and habits of the  
young are not yet become so stiff and uncomply­  
ing as when more advanced in life; they form  
more easily to each other, and hence many occa­  
sions of disgust are removed. And if youth has  
less of that prudence which is necessary to man­  
age a family, yet the parent and elder friends of  
young married persons are generally at hand, to  
afford their advice, which amply supplies that  
defect; and by early marriage youth is sooner  
formed to regular and useful life; and possibly  
some of those accidents or connections that might  
have injured the constitution or reputation, or  
both, are thereby happily prevented.  
Particular circumstances of particular persons  
may possibly sometimes make it prudent to de­  
lay entering into that state; but in general, when  
nature has rendered our bodies lit for it, the pre­  
sumption is in nature&#x27;s favor, that she has not  
judged amiss in making us desire it. Late mar­

verb, are early orphans ; a melancholy reflection  
to those whose case it may be ! With us in  
America, marriages are generally in the morn­  
ing of life ; our children are therefore educated  
and settled in the world by noon; and thus our  
business being done, we have an afternoon and  
evening of cheerful leisure to ourselves, such as  
our friend at present enjoys.  
In fine, 1 am glad you are married, and con­  
gratulate you most cordially upon it. You are  
now in the way of becoming an useful citizen,  
and you have escaped the unnatural state of  
celibacy for life, the fate of many here who ne­  
ver intended it, but who, having too long post­  
poned the change of their condition, find at  
length that it is too late to think of it; and so  
live all their lives in a situation that greatly les­

books bears not the value of its proporlion to the  
set?What think you of the odd half of a pair of  
scissors ??it can t well cut any?it mav possi­

Pray make my compliments and best wishes  
acceptable to your bride. I am old and heavy,

privilege, that of giving advice to younger

tions that have been made by numerous persons to your own. You  
may remember, when you consulted me on the occasion, that I thought

that early ones stand the best cl of happi The temper and

habits of the young are not yet become so stiff and uncomplying, as  
when more advanced in life; they form more easily to each other, and  
hence many occasions of disgust are removed. And if youth has less  
of that prudence which is necessary to manage a family, yet the parents  
and elder friends of young married persons are generally at hand to  
afford their advice, which amply supplies that defect; and by early  
marriage, youth is sooner formed to regular and useful life; and possi-  
bly some of those accidents or connections, that might have injured  
the constitution, or reputation, or both, are thereby happily prevented.  
Particular circumstances of particular persons may possibly some-  
times make it prudent to delay entering into that siate; but in general,  
when nature has rendered our bodies fit for it, the presumption is in  
nature’s favor, that she has not judged amiss in making us desire it.  
Late marriages are often attended, too, with this further inconveni-  
ence—that there is not the same chance that the parents shall live to  
see their offspring educated. Late children, says the Spanish proverb,  
are early orphans. A melancholy reflection to those whose case it may  
be! With us in America, marriages are generally in the morning of  
life; our children are therefore educated and settled in the world by  
noon; and thus, our business being done, we have an afternoon and  
evening of cheerful leisure to ourselves; such as our friend at present  
enjoys. By these early marriages we are blessed with more children;  
and from the mode among us, founded by nature, of every mother  
suckling and nursing her own child, more of them are raised. Thence  
the swift progress of population among us, unparalleled in Europe. In  
fine, lam glad you are married, and congratulate you most cordially  
upon it. You are now in the way of becoming a useful citizen; and  
you have escaped the unnatural state of celibacy for life—the fate of  
many here, who never intended it, but who, having too long postponed  
the change of their condition, find, at length, that it is too late to think  
of it, and so live all their lives in a situation that greatly lessens a man’s  
value. An odd volume ofa set of books bears not the value of its pro-  
portion to the set; what think you of the odd half of a pair of scissors ?  
It can’t well cut anything; it may possibly serve to scrape a trencher.  
Pray make my compliments and best wishes acceptable to your  
bride. I am old and heavy, or I should ere this have presented them  
in person. I shall make but small use of the old man’s privilege, that  
of giving advice to younger friends. Treat your wife always with re-  
spect; it will procure respect to you, not only from her, but from all  
that observe it. Never use a slighting expression to her, even in jest,  
for slights in jest, after frequent bandyings, are apt to end in angry  
earnest. Be studious in your profession, and you will be learned. Be  
industrious and frugal, and you will be rich. Be sober and temperate,  
and you will be healthy. Be in general virtuous, and you will be  
happy. At least, you will, by such conduct, stand the best chance for  
such consequences. I pray God to bless you both; being ever your  
affectionate friend, B. FRANKLIN.
