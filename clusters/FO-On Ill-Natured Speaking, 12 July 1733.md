’Tis strange that among Men, who are born for Society and mutual Solace, there should be any who take Pleasure in speaking disagreeable Things to their Acquaintance: But such there are, I assure you, and I should be glad if a little publick Chastisement might be any Means of reforming them. These ill-natur’d People study a Man’s Temper, or the Circumstances of his Life, meerly to know what disgusts him, and what he does not love to hear mentioned; and this they take Care to omit no Opportunity of disturbing him with. They communicate their wonderful Discoveries to others, with an ill-natur’d Satisfaction in their Countenances, Say such a Thing to such a Man, and you cannot mortify him worse. They delight (to use their own Phrase) in touching gall’d Horses that they may see ’em winch. Like Flies, a sore Place is a Feast to them. Know, ye Wretches, that the meanest Insect, the trifling Musketoe, the filthy Bugg, have, as well as you, the Power of giving Pain to Men; but to be able to give Pleasure to your Fellow Creatures, requires Good-Nature, and a kind and humane Disposition, joined with Talents to which ye seem to have no Pretension.
