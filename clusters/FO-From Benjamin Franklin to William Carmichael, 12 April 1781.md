Having in view at present no other Point to gain but that of Rest, I do not take their Malice so much amiss, as it may farther my Project, and perhaps be of some Advantage to you. Lee and Izard are open &amp; so far honourable Enemies, the Adams’s, if Enemies, are more cover’d. I never did any of them the least Injury, and can conceive no other Source of their Malice but Envy. To be sure, the excessive Respect shown me here by all Ranks of People, &amp; the little Notice taken of them, was a mortifying Circumstance, but it was what I could neither prevent or remedy. Those who feel Pain at seeing others enjoy Pleasure, and are unhappy because others are happy, must meet daily with so many Causes of Torment, that I conceive them to be already in a State of Damnation, and on that Account I ought if I could to drop all Resentment with regard to those two Gentlemen. But I cannot help being concern’d at the Mischief their ill Tempers will be continually doing in our publick Affairs, whenever they have any Concern in them.
