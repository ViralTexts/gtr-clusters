REPLIES  
  
account of what he learnt in America is  
full of idle stories, which he pick’d up  
among ignorant people, and either forget-  
ting of whom he had them, or willing to  
give them some authority, he has ascribed  
them to persons of reputation who never  
heard of them till they were found in  
his book. And when he really had  
stories from such persons, he has varied  
the circumstances unaccountably, so that  
I have been ashamed to meet with some  
mentioned as from me. It is dangerous  
conversing with these strangers that keep  
journals,”  
Henry STEVENS, of Vermon
