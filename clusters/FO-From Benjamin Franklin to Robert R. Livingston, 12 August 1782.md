Your Approbation of my Idea of a Medal to perpetuate the Memory of York &amp; Saratoga Victories gives me great Pleasure, and encourages me to have it struck. I wish you would acquaint me what kind of a Monument at York the Emblems required are to be fix’d on; whether an Obelisk or a Column; its Dimentions; whether any Part of it is to be Marble, and the Emblems carved on it; and whether the Work is to be executed by the excellent artists in that Way which Paris afford; and if so to what Expence they are to be limited? This puts me in mind of a Monument I got made here and sent to America by order of Congress 5 Years since. I have heard of its Arrival and nothing more. It was admired here for its elegant antique Simplicity of Design, and the various beautiful Marbles used in its Composition. It was intended to be fix’d against a Wall in the State house at Philadelphia. I know not why it has been so long neglected. It would me thinks, be well to enquire after it, and get it put up some where. Directions for fixing it were sent with it. I enclose a Print of it. The Inscription in the Engraving is not on the monument: It was merely the Fancy of the Engraver. There is a white Plate of Marble left smooth to receive such Inscription as the Congress should think proper.

against a wall in the State House of Philadelphia.” And this intention the  
engraver has expressed at the foot of the plate in the following lines :—
