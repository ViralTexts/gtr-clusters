It was very prudently done of you not to inter-  
fere when his mother thought fit to correct him;  
which pleased me the more, as I feared, from your  
fondness of him, that he would be too much  
humored, and perhaps spoiled. There is a story  
of two little boys in the street; one was crying  
bitterly; the other came to him to ask what was  
the matter. “I have been,” says he, “for a penny-  
worth of vinegar, and I have broken the glass, and  
spilled the vinegar, and my mother will whip me.”  
“No, she won’t whip you,” says the other. “Indeed  
she will,” says he. “ What,” says the other, “have  
you then got ne’er a grandmother?”
