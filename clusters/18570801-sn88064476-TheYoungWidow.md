She is modest, but not bashful,  
Free and easy, but not bold,  
Like an apple, ripe and mellow,  
Not too young and not too old;  
Half inviting half repulsive,  
Now advancing, and now shy;  
There is mischief in her dimple,  
There is danger in her eye.  
  
She has studied human nature;    
She is schooled in all its arts;  
She has taken her diploma,  
As the mistress of all hearts.  
She can tell the very moment  
When to sigh and when to smile;  
O, a maid is sometimes charming,  
But a window, all the while!  
  
Are you sad? how very serious  
Will her handsome face become;  
Are you angry? she is wretched,  
Lonely, friendless, tearful, dumb;  
Are you mirthful? how her laughter,  
Silver-sounding, will ring out,  
She can lure, and catch, and play you  
As the angler does the trout.  
  
Ye old bachelors of forty,  
Who have grown so bold and wise;  
Young Americans of twenty,  
With the love-locks in your eyes;  
You may practise all the lessons  
Taught by Cupid since the fall,  
But I know a little widow,  
Who could win and fool you all!
