She is modest, but not bashful,  
Free and easy, but not bold,  
Like an apple, ripe and mellow,  
Not too young and not too old;  
Half inviting half repulsive,  
Now advancing, and now shy;  
There is mischief in her dimple,  
There is danger in her eye.  
  
She has studied human nature;    
She is schooled in all its arts;  
She has taken her diploma,  
As the mistress of all hearts.  
She can tell the very moment  
When to sigh and when to smile;  
O, a maid is sometimes charming,  
But a window, all the while!  
  
Are you sad? how very serious  
Will her handsome face become;  
Are you angry? she is wretched,  
Lonely, friendless, tearful, dumb;  
Are you mirthful? how her laughter,  
Silver-sounding, will ring out,  
She can lure, and catch, and play you  
As the angler does the trout.  
  
Ye old bachelors of forty,  
Who have grown so bold and wise;  
Young Americans of twenty,  
With the love-locks in your eyes;  
You may practise all the lessons  
Taught by Cupid since the fall,  
But I know a little widow,  
Who could win and fool you all!

THE YOUNG WIDOW.  
  
The Mobile Tribune has these pleasant verses  
  
from Robert Josselyn, of Jackson, Miss:  
  
She is modest, but not bashful,  
Free and easy, but not bold,  
Like an apple, ripe and mellow,  
Not too young and not too old;  
Half inviting, half repulsive,  
Aull Now advancing, and now shy;  
There is mischief in her dimple,  
There is danger in her eye.  
She has studied human nature:  
She is schooled in all her arts;  
She has taken her diploma.  
As the potent &quot;Queen of Hearts.&quot;  
edt She can tell the very moment  
When to sigh and when to smile;  
O, a maid is sometimes charming,  
But a widow all the while.  
Are you sad? how very serious  
Will her handsome face become;  
Are you angry? she is wretched,  
Lonely, friendless, tearful, dumb;  
Are you mirthful? how her laughter,  
Silver-sounding, will ring out  
She can lure and ca&#x27;ch and play you,  
As the angler does the trout.  
 You old bachelors of forty,  
Who have grown so baid and wise,  
Young Americans of twenty,  
With the love-looks in your eyes,  
ini You may practise all the lessons,  
Taught by Cupid since the fall,  
But I know a little winow  
 Who could win and fool you all.

THE YOUNG WIDOW.  
  
BY ROBERT JOSSELYN.  
  
She is modest, but not bashful;  
Free and easy, but not bold;  
Like an apple, ripe and mellow,  
Not too young, and not too old.  
Half inviting, half repulsive;  
Now inviting, and now shy  
There is mischief in her dimplo,  
There is danger in her eye.  
She has studied human nature;  
She is schooled in all her acts;  
She has taken her diploma  
As the mistress of all hearts.  
She can tell the very momen!  
When to sigh and when to smile;  
 a maid is sometimes charming,  
But a widow all the while!  
Are you sad? how very serious  
Will her hanodsome face become!  
Are you angry? she is wretched,  
Lonely, friendless, fearful, dumb!  
Are you mirthful? how her laughter,  
Silver-sounding, will ring out!  
She can lure, and catch, and play you,  
As the angler does the trout.  
Ye old bachelors of forty,  
Who have grown bald and wise  
Young Americans of twenty,  
With the love-locks in your eyes  
You may practice all the lessons  
Taught by Cupid since the fall,  
But I know a little widow  
Who could win and fool you all.

ere is  
mischief in her dimple, There is danger  
in her eye. . . . She has studied human  
nature ; She is schooled in all the arts  
; She has taken her diploma As the  
mistress of all hearts. She can tell the  
very moment When to sigh and when to  
sniue ; Oh, a maid is sometimes charming  
! But a widow— all the while. Are you  
sad? How very serious&#x27; &#x27;Will her  
handsome face become ! Are you angry?  
She is wretched, Ixjnely, friendless,  
fearful, dumb ! Are you mirthful ? How  
her laughter, Silver sounding, will ring  
out ! She can lure and catch and play  
you,1 As the angler does the trout. Ye  
old bachelors of forty, Who have grown  
so bold and wise ; Young Americans of  
twenty, With the love-looks in your eyes  
; You may practice all the lessons  
Taught by Cupid since the fall ; But I  
know a little widow &#x27; Who could win and  
fool you alL

She is modest, but not bashful,  
Free and easy, but not bold;  
Like au apple ripe and mellow,  
Not too young and not too old;  
Half inviting, half repulsing,  
Not advancing and not shy;  
There is mischief in her dimple,  
There is danger in her eye.  
She has studied human nature;  
She is schooled in all the arts;  
She has taken her diploma  
As the mistress of all hearts.  
She can tell the very mom nt  
When to sigh and when to smile;  
O, a maid is sometimes charming,  
But the widow all the while.  
Are you sad ? How very serious  
Will her handsome face become!  
Are you apgry? She is wretched,  
Lonely*mendless, tearful, dumb!  
Are you mirthful? How her laughter,  
Silver sounding, will ring out!  
She can lure ana catch and play you,  
As the angler does the trout.  
Ye old bachelors of forty,  
Who have grown so bald and wise;  
Young Americans of twenty,  
With the love looks in your eyes;  
You may practice all the lessons  
Taught by Cupid since the fall;  
But I know a little widow  
Who could win and fool you all
