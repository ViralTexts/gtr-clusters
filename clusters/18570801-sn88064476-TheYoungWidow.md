O, a maid is sometimes charming,  
But a window, all the while!

Will her handsome face become;  
Are you angry? she is wretched,  
Lonely, friendless, tearful, dumb;  
Are you mirthful? how her laughter,  
Silver-sounding, will ring out,  
She can lure, and catch, and play you

th the invita-  
tion so often repeated by his brothers in a less  
public way, ** Love me little, love me long.’’  
  
Edward Coke was of the opinion that ‘‘ A  
man’s house is his castle.’’ To Milton we  
owe ‘* The Paradise of fools,’’ ‘‘  
of sweets,’’  
  
A wilderness  
  
‘  
  
and ‘* Moping melancholy and  
  
moonstruck madness.”’  
  
Edward Young tells us ‘‘ Death loves a  
shining mark,’’ and ‘‘ A fool at forty is a fool  
indeed.’’  
  
From Bacon comes ‘‘ Knowledge is power, *’  
and Thomas Southerne reminds us that ‘* Pity’s  
akin to love,’’ while Dean Swift thought that  
‘* Bread is the staff of life.’’  
  
THE YOUNG WIDOW.  
  
She is modest, but not bashful—  
Free and easy, but not bold ;  
Like an apple, ripe and mellow—  
  
Not too young, and not too old ;  
Half-inviting, half-repulsing—  
  
Now advancing, and now shy—  
There is mischief in her dimple,  
  
There is danger in her eye.  
  
She has studied human nature ;  
She is schooled in all her arts ;  
She has taken her diploma  
As the mistress of all hearts  
She can tell the very moment  
When to sigh and when to smile.  
Oh, a maid is soinetimes charming,  
But a widow all the while.  
  
Are you sad? How very serious  
  
Will her handspme face become !  
  
Are you angry? She is wretched,  
Lonely, friendless, tearful, duinb !  
  
Are you mirthful? How her laughter,  
Silver-sounding, will ring out!  
  
She can lure, and catch, and play you,  
As an angler does the trout.  
  
Ye old bachelors of forty,  
Who have grown so bold and wise—  
Young Americans of twenty,  
With the love-looks in your eyes—  
You may practice all the lessons  
Taught by Cupid since the fall,  
But I know a little widow  
Who can win and fool you all,

There are madrigals to duchesses  
Whose nose and hose are blue ;  
There are ballads to the dairymaid  
With her ankles in a brook,  
But why don’t poets write a rhyme  
Or so about the cook ?  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Philometry....Ernest Lindell Crandall....Springfield Graphic  
  
‘“*How much do you love me?” cried little Rose;  
‘* As men their souls!” cry I,  
  
“Your smile is my single lease of life;  
  
Withhold it, and I die.”  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Current Literature  
  
“Now, do you love me as I love you?”  
But Rose made no reply.  
She nestles her bright head on my arm,  
And the silent hours steal by.  
  
The Young Widow....Songs of Society  
She is modest, but not bashful,  
Free and easy, but not bold ;  
Like an apple, ripe and mellow,  
Not too young and not too old;  
Half inviting, half repulsive,  
Now advancing, and now shy—  
There is mischief in her dimple,  
There is danger in her eye.  
  
She has studied human nature;  
She is schooled in all the arts;  
She has taken her diploma  
As the mistress of all hearts.  
She can tell the very moment  
When to sigh and when to smile;  
Oh, a maid is sometimes charming !  
But a widow—all the while.  
  
Are you sad? How very serious  
Will her handsome face become!  
Are you angry? She is wretched,  
Lonely, friendless, fearful, dumb!  
Are you mirthful? How her laughter,  
Silver sounding, will ring out!  
She can lure and catch and play you,  
As the angler does the trout.  
  
Ye old bachelors of forty,  
  
Who have grown so bald and wise ;  
Young Americans of twenty,  
  
With the love-looks in your eyes ;  
You may practice all the lessons  
  
Taught by Cupid since the fall ;  
But I know a little widow
