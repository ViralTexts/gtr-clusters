form’d me lately, that his Court had our proposed Plan under Consideration and that we should soon hear from them. I sent it to Congress by Barney, and hear the Ship is arrived. A Commission &amp; Instructions will be wanting for that also, should the Congress be disposed to conclude a Treaty with that Nation.  
I see by the Public Prints, that the Congress have ratified the contract I made with the Minister here respecting the Loans and Aids we had received; but the Ratification itself, tho’ directed to be sent me, has never come to hand, and I am often asked for it. I beg it may be forwarded by the first Opportunity.  
There has been with me lately Mr. Pierre du Calvet, a Merchant of Montreal, who when our Army was in Canada, furnished our Generals &amp; Officers with many things they wanted, taking their Receipts and promisory Notes for Payment; and when the English repossess’d the Country, he was imprisoned  
  
and his Estate seized, on Account of the Services he had rendered us. He has shown me the Originals of his Papers, which I think are genuine. He produced also a Quantity of Congress Paper which he says he receiv’d in Payment for some of the Supplies, and which appear’d to me of our first Emissions, and yet all fresh and clean, as having passed thro’ no other hands. When he was discharg’d from Prison, he could not obtain Permission to go into the United States to claim the Debt, but was allow’d to go to England; and from thence he came hither to solicit Payment from me. Having no Authority to meddle with such Debts, and the Sum being considerable, I refus’d and advised him to take Passage for America, and make his Application to Congress. He said he was grown old, much broken and weakned by near 3 Years Imprisonment, and that the Voyage from Canada to London had like to have been too much for him, he being sick all the Way; so that he could not think of another, tho’ distressed for want of his Money. He appears an honest Man, and his Case a hard one. I have therefore undertaken to forward his Papers, and I beg leave to recommend them to the speedy Consideration of Congress, To

ished to find how  
corrupt the administration of the Govern­  
ment had become, even at that carly day.  
We find in Sparks&#x27; diplomatic correspon­  
dence, 4th vol, page 175, a letter from  
Benjamin Franklin who was then in  
France, which makes mention of Mr. Du  
Calvet&#x27;s claims on the Government of the  
United States. Du Calvet, like many oth­  
ers, had made disbursements, and had fur­  
nished goods to the Continental Army,  
when they occupied the City of Montreal,  
for which he had received Continental bills,  
the value of which was mere nominal.  
Mr Franklin&#x27; letter is dated,  
&quot;Passy, France, Nov. 1st, 1783.  
There has been with me lately Mr Pierre  
Du Calvet, a merchant of Montreal, who,  
when our army was in Canada, fursished  
our Generals and Officers with many  
things they wanted, taking their receipts  
and promissory notes for payment; and  
when the English repossessed the country,  
he was imprisoned, and his estate seized,  
on account of the services he had rendered  
us. He has shown me the originals of his  
papers, which I think are genuine. He  
  
produced also a quantity of Congress pa  
  
per, which he says he received in paymemt  
  
for some of the supplies, and which ap  
  
peared to me of our first emissions, and  
yet all fresh and clean, as having passed  
through no other hands. When he wa  
discharged from prison, he could not ob  
  
tain permission to go into the United  
States to claim the debt, but was allowed  
  
to go to England, and from thence he  
  
came hither to solicit payment from me.  
Having no authority to meddle with such  
debts, and the sum being considerable, I  
refused, and advised him to take passage  
for America, and make his application to  
Congress. He said he was grown old,  
much broken and weakened by near three  
years imprisonment, and that the voyage  
from Canada to London had like to have  
been too much for him, he being sick all  
  
the way; so that he could not think of  
  
another, though distressed for want of his  
money. He appears an honest man, and  
his case a hard one. I have therefore un­  
dertaken to forward his papers, and I beg  
leave to recommend them to the speedy con­  
sideration of Congress,&quot; &amp;c. &amp;c
