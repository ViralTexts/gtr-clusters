rom the minutes I used to keep of the experiments I made, with memorandums of such as I purposed to make, the reasons for making them, and the observations that arose upon them, from which minutes my letters were afterwards drawn. By this extract you will see that the thought was not so much “an out-of-the-way one,” but that it might have occurred to any electrician.  
“Nov. 7, 1749. Electrical fluid agrees with lightning in these particulars: 1. Giving light. 2. Colour of the light. 3. Crooked direction. 4. Swift motion. 5. Being conducted by metals. 6. Crack or noise in exploding. 7. Subsisting in water or ice. 8. Rending bodies it passes through. 9. Destroying animals. 10. Melting metals. 11. Firing inflammable substances. 12. Sulphureous smell. The electric fluid is attracted by points. We do not know whether this property is in lightning. But since they agree in all the particulars wherein we can already compare them, is it not probable they agree likewise in this? Let the experiment be made.”

 appears probable, that every change from positive to negative, and from negative to positive, that, during a thunder gust, we see in the cork-balls annexed to the apparatus, is not owing to the presence of clouds in the same state, but often to the absence of positive or negative clouds, that, having just passed, leave the rod in the opposite state.  
The knocking down of the six men was performed with two of my large jarrs not fully charged. I laid one end of my discharging rod upon the head of the first; he laid his hand on the head of the second; the second his hand on the head of the third, and so to the last, who held, in his hand, the chain that was connected with the outside of the jarrs. When they were thus placed, I applied the other end of my rod to the prime-conductor, and they all dropt together. When they got up, they all declared they had not felt any stroke, and wondered how they came to fall; nor did any of them either hear the crack, or see the light of it. You suppose it a dangerous experiment; but I had once suffered the same myself, receiving, by accident, an equal stroke through my head, that struck me down, without hurting me: And I had seen a young woman that was about to be electrified through the feet, (for some indisposition) receive a greater charge through the head, by inadvertently stooping forward to look at the placing of her feet, till her forehead (as she was very tall) came too near my prime-conductor: She dropt, but instantly got up again, complaining of nothing. A person so struck, sinks down doubled, or folded together as it were, the joints losing their strength and stiffness at once, so that he drops on the spot where he stood, instantly, and there is no previous staggering, nor does he ever fall lengthwise. Too great a charge might, indeed, kill a man, but I have not yet seen any hurt done by it. It would certainly, as you observe, be the easiest of all deaths.

I find a frank acknowledgment of one’s ignorance is not only the easiest way to get rid of a difficulty, but the likeliest way to obtain information, and therefore I practice it: I think it an honest policy. Those who affect to be thought to know every thing, and so undertake to explain every thing, often remain long ignorant of many things that others could and would instruct them in, if they appeared less conceited.  
The treatment your friend has met with is so common, that no man who knows what the world is, and ever has been, should expect to escape it. There are every where a number of people, who, being totally destitute of any inventive faculty themselves, do not readily conceive that others may possess it: They think of inventions as of miracles; there might be such formerly, but they are ceased. With these, every one who offers a new invention is deem’d a pretender: He had it from some other country, or from some book: A man of their own acquaintance; one who has no more sense than themselves, could not possibly, in their opinion, have been the inventer of any thing. They are confirmed, too, in these sentiments, by frequent instances of pretensions to invention, which vanity is daily producing. That vanity too, though an incitement to invention, is, at the same time, the pest of inventors. Jealousy and Envy deny the merit or the novelty of your invention; but Vanity, when the novelty and merit are established, claims it for its own. The

the experiment on his own flesh instead of that of the fowl.”  
Franklin’s experiments upon the effect of the electric discharge  
upon the human subject he thus describes in a letter to a friend in  
Charleston, S. C., written in 1755: * ‘* The knocking down of the  
six men was performed with two of my large jars not fully charged.  
I laid one end of my discharging rod upon the head of the first ;  
he laid his hand on the head of the second ; the second his hand  
on the head of the third ; and so to the last, who held in his hand  
the chain that was connected with the outside of the jars. When  
they were thus placed, I applied the other end of my rod to the  
prime conductor and they all dropt together. When they got up  
they all declared they had not felt any stroke, and wondered how they  
came to fall; nor did any of them either hear the crack or see the  
light of it. You suppose it isa dangerous experiment; but I had  
once suffered the same myself, receiving by accident an equal stroke

through my head that struck me down without hurting me. And I  
had seen a young woman that was about to be electrified through  
the feet (for some indisposition) receive a greater charge through  
the head by inadvertently stooping forward to look at the placing  
of her feet, till her forehead (as she was very tall) came too near  
my prime conductor: She dropt, but instantly got up again com-  
plaining of nothing. A person so struck sinks down doubled or  
folded together as it were, the joints losing their strength and stiff-  
ness at once, so that he drops on the spot where he stood, instantly,  
and there is no previous staggering, nor does he ever fall length-  
wise. Too great a charge might indeed kill a man, but I have not  
yet seen any hurt done by it. It would certainly, as you observe,  
be the easiest of all deaths.’’
