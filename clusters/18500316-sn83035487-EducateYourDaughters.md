EDUCATE YOUR DAUGHTERS.—When I lived among the Choctaw Indians, I held a consultation with one of their principal chiefs, respecting the successive stage of their progress in the arts and virtues of civilized life; and among other things, he informed me at their first start they fell into a great mistake—they only sent their boys to school. They became intelligent men, but they married uneducated and uncivilized wives; and the uniform result was, that the children were all like the mother; and soon the father lost his interest in both wife and children. &#x27;And now,&#x27; said he, &#x27;if we could educate only one class of our children, we would choose the girls; for when they become mothers, they would educate their sons.&#x27; This is to the point, and it is true. No nation can become fully and permanently civilized and enlightened, when the mothers are not, to a good degree, qualified to discharge the duties of their home work of education.—*Rev. S. Dyer*.
