EDUCATE YOUR DAUGHTERS.—When I lived among the Choctaw Indians, I held a consultation with one of their principal chiefs, respecting the successive stage of their progress in the arts and virtues of civilized life; and among other things, he informed me at their first start they fell into a great mistake—they only sent their boys to school. They became intelligent men, but they married uneducated and uncivilized wives; and the uniform result was, that the children were all like the mother; and soon the father lost his interest in both wife and children. &#x27;And now,&#x27; said he, &#x27;if we could educate only one class of our children, we would choose the girls; for when they become mothers, they would educate their sons.&#x27; This is to the point, and it is true. No nation can become fully and permanently civilized and enlightened, when the mothers are not, to a good degree, qualified to discharge the duties of their home work of education.—*Rev. S. Dyer*.

The Mother Moulds the Man.—That  
it, is the mother who moulds the man is a  
sentiment beautifully illustrated by the  
following observation of a shrewd writer:  
“When I lived among the Choctaw In­  
dians, I he&#x27;d a consulration with one of  
their chief-, respecting the successive stages  
of their progress in the arts of civilized  
life, and among other things, lie informed  
me that, at their start they fell into a  
great mistake: they only sent their boys  
to school. These boys came homo intelli­  
g &#x27;ntmen, but they married uneducated  
and uncivilized wives, and the uniform re­  
sult was, that the children were all like  
their mothers. Thus the father soon lost  
all bis interests in both wife and children.”  
“And now,” said he “if we would educate  
but one class of our children, we should  
choose the girls, for when they become  
mothers, they educate their sons. This is  
the point and it is true. No nation can  
become fully enlightened when mothers  
are not in a good degree, qualified to  
discharge the duties of the home-work of  
education.

Tue Morugz-MouLps THE Man.—That it is  
the mother who moulds the man is a senti­  
ment beautifully illustrated by the following  
recorded ebservation of a shrewd writer :—  
«« When I lived among the Choctaw Indi­  
ans | held a consultation with one of their  
chiefs respecting the successive stages of  
their progress in the arts ot civilized life, and  
among other things, he informed me that,  
at their start they fell into a great mistake ;  
they only sent their .boys to school. These  
boys came home intelligent men, but they  
married uneducated uncivilized wives, and  
the uniform result was, that the children  
were all like their mothers. Thus the father  
soon lost all his interest in both wife and  
children. And now, said he, if we would  
educate but one class of our children, we  
should choose the girls, for when they be­  
come mothers, they will educate their sons.  
This is the point and its true. No nation  
can become fully enlightened when mothers  
are Mot, in a good degree qualified to dis­  
charge the duties of the home work of edu­  
cation.”’

THE MOTHER MOULDS THE MAN-  
That it is the mother who moulds the man, is  
a sentiment beautifully illustrated by tbe follow­  
ing recorded observation of a shrewd writer:  
“ When I lived among the Choctaw Indians, i  
held a consultation with one of their chiefs, re­  
specting the successive stages of their progress in  
the arts of civilized life; and, among other things,  
he informed me that at their start they made a  
great mistake—they only sent boys to school.  
These boys came home intelligent men, but they,  
married uneducated and uncivilized wives—and  
the uniform result was tbe children were iill like  
their mothers. The father soon lost all his inte­  
rest both in wife and children. ‘ And now/ said  
he f if we would educate but one class of our  
children, we should choose the girls; for when  
they become mothers they educate their sons.’”  
This is the point, and it is true. No nation can  
become fully enlightened when mothers are not  
in a good degree qualified to discharge the, duties  
of the home-work of education.

Don&#x27;t Fonorr YociHisia—When I lived  
among the Choctaw Indians, say? a traveller,  
i I held a consultation with one of their chiefs  
respecting the stages of their progress in the  
arts of civilized life, and among other things he  
informed me that at their start they made s  
igreat mistake—they only scot their boys to  
school. These boys came home intelligent  
! men, but they married uneducated and uncivil­  
ized wives; and the uniform result was the  
children were all like rheir mothers. The  
falber soon lost all his interest both in wife  
and children. And now, said he. il we would  
educate but one class of our children, wc should  
choose the girls, for when Ibey bccom ■ mother*,  
&#x27;they educate their sons. This is the point,  
and it is true. No nation can become fully  
enlightened when mothers are not qualified to  
discharge the duties of the home work of cdu  
cation. Parents ! give your daughters as well  
as your sons, the best education in your power.
