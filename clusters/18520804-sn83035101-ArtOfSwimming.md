ART OF SWIMMING.—Men are drowned by raising their arms above water, the unbuoyed weight of which depresses the head. Other animals have neither motion or ability to act in a similar manner, therefore swim naturally. When a man falls into deep water, he will rise to the surface, and will continue there if he does not elevate his hands. If he moves his hands under water in any way he pleases, his head will rise so high as to allow him free liberty to breathe, and if he will use his legs as in the act of walking (or rather walking upstairs,) his shoulders will rise above the water, so that he may use less exertions with his hands, or apply them to some other purpose. These plain directions are recommended to the recollection of those who have not learned to swim in their youth, as they may be found highly advantageous in preserving life.

How Not to Drown.  
Men are drowned by raising their  
arms above water, the uubuoying weight  
of which depresses the head. Other  
animals have neither motion nor ability  
to act in a similar manner, and therefore  
swim naturally. When a man falls into  
deep water, he will rise to the surface,  
and will continue there if he does not  
elevate his hands. If he moves his  
hands under the water in any way he  
pleases, his head will rise so high as to  
allow him free liberty to breathe, and if  
he will use his legs in the act of walking  
(or rather walking up stairs), his  
shoulders will rise above the water, so  
that he may use less exertion with his  
hands, or apply them to other purposes.  
These plain directions are recommended  
to the recollection of those who have  
not learned to swim in their youth, as  
they may be found highly advantageous  
in preserving life

is from eight to nine pounds. If they try to push the head up out  
of water they destroy the easy position of the body, and lose  
the extra buoyancy. A stout person has greater extra buoyancy  
than a thin one.  
  
Drowning is caused by allowing the water to replace the air in  
the body; this causes the body to become heavier than an equal  
volume of water, and therefore to sink.  
  
The point where a body sinks is generally marked by air bubbles,  
After sinking the first time, the body sometimes rises to the  
surface again. This has been known to be repeated even a second  
time.

or Druggists. Men are drowned by raising  
their arms above water the unbuoyed  
weight of which depresses the head.  
Other animals have neither notion to  
actin a similar manner, and therefore  
swim naturally. When a man falls into  
deep water, he will rise to the surface,  
and will continue there, if he does not  
elevate his hands. If he move his hands  
under water in any. manner he pleases,  
his head will rise so high as to allow  
him free liberty to breathe; and if he  
move his legs as in the act of working  
(or rather walking up stairs), his  
shoulders will rise above the water, so  
that he may use less exertion with his  
hands, and apply them to other purposes.  
These plain directions are recommended  
to the recollection of those who have  
not learied to swim in their youth, as  
they may be fopnd highly advautageous in  
preserving life
