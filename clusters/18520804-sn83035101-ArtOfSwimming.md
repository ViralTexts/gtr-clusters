ART OF SWIMMING.—Men are drowned by raising their arms above water, the unbuoyed weight of which depresses the head. Other animals have neither motion or ability to act in a similar manner, therefore swim naturally. When a man falls into deep water, he will rise to the surface, and will continue there if he does not elevate his hands. If he moves his hands under water in any way he pleases, his head will rise so high as to allow him free liberty to breathe, and if he will use his legs as in the act of walking (or rather walking upstairs,) his shoulders will rise above the water, so that he may use less exertions with his hands, or apply them to some other purpose. These plain directions are recommended to the recollection of those who have not learned to swim in their youth, as they may be found highly advantageous in preserving life.

 OF  
DROWNING. -Men are often drowned by  
raising their arms above water, the  
unboyed weight of which depresses the  
head. Other animals have neither motion  
nor ability to act similarly, and  
therefore swim naturally! When a &amp;nbsp;  
man falls into deep water, he will rise  
to the surface, and will continue there  
if he do not elevate his hands. If he  
move his &amp;nbsp; hands under the water,  
in any manner he pleases, his head will  
rise so high as to &amp;nbsp; allow him free  
liberty to breathe ; and if he move his  
legs, as in the action of &amp;nbsp; walking  
(or rather of walking up stairs) his  
shoulders will rise above the water ; so  
that he may use less exertion with his  
hands or apply them to other purposes.  
These plain directions are recommended  
to the recollection of those who have  
not learnt to swim in their youth, as  
they may be found highly advantageous in  
preserving life.

nothing can be more injurious, or more  
likely to destroy any remains of vitality  
that may exist. The most active and  
useful practice is to endeavour to restore  
breathing, by pressing on the chest so a8  
to excite its natural actions, after drying  
the patient, and placing him in a horizon-  
tal position in bed, between two Sratiate,  
applying warmth in the quickest

in this manner until medical aid can be  
obtained, even if no symptom of vitality

their lives in consequence of raising their

ART OF SWIMMING.  
i Men are drowned by raising their arms  
above the water, the unbuoyed weight of which  
depresses the head. Other animals have nei­  
ther motion nor ability to act in a similar man­  
ner, and therefore swim naturally. When a  
man falls into deep water, he will rise to the  
surface, and will continue there if he does not  
elevate his hands. If he moves his hands un­  
der water in any way he pleases, his head will  
rise so high as to allow him free liberty to  
breathe ; and if he will use his legs in the act  
of walking, or rather walking up stairs, his  
shoulders will rise above the water, so that he  
may use less exertion with his hands, or apply  
them to some other purpose. These plain di-  
Tections are recommended to the recollection  
of those who have not learned to swim in their  
youth, as they may be found highly advanta­  
geous in preserving life.

e same number of tons as was  
bought in 1651, will require several millions  
more. As the importation will probably exceed  
this year, what it has ever been before, it re­  
quires but little calculation to fersee how vastly  
our foreign debt will be enlarged. It is true this  
debt will not have to be liquidated entirely for  
many years to come, and that, before pay-day  
comes, the roads will all be earning money.—  
Still the inquiry comes back again and again,  
when we ponder on these statistics, “have we  
not been giving way too .largely to the railroad

1 shoulders will rise above water, so that he may  
use less exertion with his bands, or apply them  
Ito some other purpose. These plain directions

THE ART OF SWIMMING. Men are  
drowned by raising their arms above water, the  
unbuoyed weight of which depresses the head.  
When a man falls into deep water, he will rise to  
the surface, and will continue there if he does not  
elevate his hands. If he moves his hands under  
the water in any way he pleases, his head will  
rise so high as to allow him free liberty to breathe  
and if he will use his legs as in the act of walk  
ing (or rather walking up stairs), his shoulders  
will rise above the water, so that he may use less  
exertion with his hands, or apply them to other  
purposes. These plain directions are recom  
mended to the recollection of those who have not  
learned to swim in their youth, as they may be  
found highly advantageous in preserving life.

As the warm season advances

great many, it may be well to recom­  
mend to the recollection of those who

have neither motion nor ability to act

not elevate his hands. If he moves  
his hands under the. water in any­

high as to allow full liberty to  
breathe; and if he will use his legs  
ns in the act of walking, or rather  
walking upstairs, his shoulders will  
rise above the water. The weight  
of the human body and the weight  
of the water differ so little that the  
least exertion in the proper direction,  
and above all presence of mind, is  
sufficient to meet any immediate dan­

Advice About Bathing.  
As the warm season advances  
. and bathing in the rivers will  
form a very desirable recreation  
and enjoyment to a great many,  
it may be well to recommend to  
the recollection of those who  
have not learned. to swim a few  
odain directions which may be  
found advantageous in preserv­  
&#x27; ing life. Men arc drowned by  
raisin&quot;&#x27; their arms above the  
. watere unbouyed weight of  
. which depresses the head. An­  
&#x27;Tmals have&#x27;neittier motion nor  
ability to act in a similar man­  
ner and therefore swim natural­  
ly. -When a man fulls in into  
deep water he will raise to the  
surface and continue there if he  
does not elevate his hands. If  
he moves his hands under the  
water in any way he pleases, his  
head will raise so high as to al­  
low full liberty to breathe, and  
: if he. will use&#x27;bis legs a in the  
. net of walking upstairs, shoul­  
ders will raise above the water.  
The weight of the human body  
and the weight of the water dif­  
fer so little, that the least exer­  
tion in the properdircction, and  
above all, presence of mind, is  
MiHlcient to meet any immedi­
