USE AND ABUSE OF SCISSORS.  
  
That simple piece of mechanism, a pair of scissors, is an invaluable aid to the editor when honestly and fairly used, says S. A. Davis in the _Journalist_. When used as a burglar&#x27;s tool to break into the columns of a contemporary newspaper and steal valuable ideas and news, without giving proper credit, public sentiment justly anathematizes the editor who puts this valuable little tool to such base uses. It is often the case that the editorial burglar is proven a fraud and pretender in more ways than one.   
  
A good many people do not know that an editor&#x27;s selections from his contemporaries is quite often the best test of his editorial ability, and that the function of the scissors are not merely to fill up vacant spaces, but to reproduce the brightest and best thoughts, and the most attractive news from all sources at the editor&#x27;s command. Readers of a newspaper often wonder why the editor&#x27;s pen is frequently superseded by the scissors on the editorial page, and the reasons are as varied and numerous as the fitful changes of human thought. Sometimes the editor&#x27;s brain is clogged or worn by physical causes, and his power of expression fail him. Often the cares of life weigh heavily upon him, and he has no heart to write or labor. If in such cases the scissors are used as a substitute for mental labor, the general result is a stupid issue, which justifies the criticism of the reader.   
  
But there are times when the editor opens his exchanges, and finds a feast for the eyes, heart and soul. The thoughts of his contemporaries glow with life, and send the warmth into his own soul. He wishes his readers to enjoy the feast, and he lovingly takes up the scissors and clips, and sighs to think that his space is inadequate to contain all the treasures so prodigally spread before him. Your true editor is generous, and will sacrifice his own ambitions as a writer during such festal occasions. His conduct at such a time is now generous, and is of far more profit to his readers to set before them than the original dish of dainties, with the label of the real arthur &lt;--! sic --&gt; affixed, than to appropriate its best thoughts to himself and reproduce them as his own.  
  
After all, the true test of a newspaper&#x27;s real value is not the amount of original matter it contains, but the average quality of all the matter appearing in its columns whether original or selected.—_New York Monthly Union_.

his friend is comprehended in “May  
God preserve yonr blessed beard.”  
Or, as an estimate of value, the&gt; say,  
“It is worth more than a man’s  
beard.” We are told of an Arab  
who chose to hazard his life by re­  
fusing to allow a surgeon to remove  
a few hairs to enable him to get at a

use AND ABUSE OF SCISSORS.  
That simple piece of mechanieism,  
a pair of scissors, is an invaluable  
aid to the editor when honestly and  
fairly used, says S. A. Davis in the  
Journalist. When used as a burg­  
lar&#x27;s tool to break into the columns

proven a fraud and pretender in  
more ways than one.  
A good many people do not know

that the functions of the scissors ars  
not merely to fill up vacant spaces,  
but to reproduce the brightest and  
best thoughts, and the most attrac­  
tive news from all sources at the ed  
tor’s command. Readers of a news­  
paper often wonder why the editor’s  
pen is frequently superseded by the  
scissors on the editorial page, and  
the reasons arc as varied and numer­  
ous as the fitful changes of human  
thought. Sometimes the editor’s  
brain is clogged or worn by physical  
causes, and his power of expression  
fail him. Often the cares of life  
weigh heavily upon him, and he has  
no heart to write or labor. If in  
such cases the scissors are used as a  
substitute for mental labor, the gen­  
eral result is a stupid issue, which  
justifies the criticism of the reader.  
But there are times when the edi  
tor opens his exchanges, and finds a  
feast for eyes, heart and soul. The  
thoughts of his contemporaries glow  
with life, and send the warmth into  
his own soul. He wishes his readers  
to enjoy the feast, and he lovingly  
takes up the scissors and clips and  
clips, and sighs to think that his  
space is inadequate to contain all the  
treasures so prodigally spread be  
fore him. Your true editor is gen­  
erous, and will sacrifice his own am­  
bitions as a writer during such festal  
occasions. His conduct at such a  
time is now generous, and is of far  
more profit to his readers to set be­  
fore them the original dish of dain­  
ties, with the label of the real arthur  
affixed, than to appropriate its best  
thoughts to himself and reproduce  
them as bis own.  
After all, the true test of a news­  
paper’s real value is not the amount  
of original matter it contains, but  
the average quality of all the matter

THE EDITORIAL SHEARS.  
A good many people do not know that an ed­  
itor’s selections &quot;from his contemporaries are  
quite often the best test of his editorial ability,  
and that the function of the scissors is not mere­  
ly to fill up vacant spaces, but to reproduce the  
brightest and best thoughts, and the most at­  
tractive news from all sources at the editor’s  
command. There are times when the editor  
opens his exchanges and finds a feast for eyes,  
heart and soul. The thoughts of his contempo­  
raries glow with life. He wishes his readers to  
enjoy the feast, and he lovingly takes up the  
scissors and clips and clips, and sighs to think  
that his space is inadequate to contain all the  
treasures so prodigally spread before him. Your  
true editor is generous, and will sacrifice his  
own ambition as a writer during such festal oc­  
casions, and it is of far more profit to his read­  
ers to set before them the original dish of dain­  
ties with the&#x27; label of the real author affixed,  
than to appropriate its best thoughts to himself,  
and reproduce them as his own. After all, the  
true test of a newspaper’s real value is not the  
amount of original matter it contains, but the  
average quality of all the matter appearing in  
its columns, whether original or selected.— N.

the function of the scissors is not merely to fill  
op vacant spaces, bat to reproduce the brightest

are times when the editor opens his exchanges  
and finds a feast for eyes, heart and soul. The  
thoughts of his contemporaries glow with life.  
He wishes his readers to enjoy the feast, and he  
lovingly takes up the scissors and clips and  
clips, and t ighs to think that his space is inade­  
quate to contain all the treasures so prodigally  
spread before him. Your true editor is gener­

the original dish of dainties with the label of  
the real author affixed, than to appropriate its  
best thoughts to himself and reproduce them

paper’s real value is not the amount of the  
original matter it contains, but the average  
quality of all the matter appearing in its col­
