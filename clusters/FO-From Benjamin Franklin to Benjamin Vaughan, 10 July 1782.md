e intended Settler; and should not have been used as a Cover for the Goods of English Merchants intrusted to him, to carry on a contraband Commerce.— The Bills of Harley &amp; Drummond which you mention as having been enclosed in the same Letter, afford farther Suspicion of his Situation in that Country, &amp; that the Bills have not been fairly come by.—  
Your Sentiments relating to Privateers appear to me very just, &amp; those concerning Arbitrators not less so, tho’ perhaps less likely to be adopted. I go with you as far as you go, in Proposals for diminishing the Occasions &amp; Mischiefs of War, &amp; perhaps a little farther.— By the Original Law of Nations, War &amp; Extirpation was the Punishment of Injury. Humanizing by degrees, it admitted Slavery instead of Death. A farther Step was, the Exchange of Prisoners instead of Slavery. Another, to respect more the property of private Persons under Conquest, &amp; to be content with acquir’d Dominion. Why should not this Law of Nations go on improving? Ages have interven’d between its several Steps; but as Knowledge of late encreases rapidly, why should not those Steps be quicken’d? Why should it not be agreed to as the future Law of Nations that in any War hereafter the following Descriptions of Men should be undisturbed, have the Protection of both sides, &amp; be permitted to follow their employments in Surety, viz  
1. Cultivators of the Earth, because they labor for the Subsistance of Mankind.  
2. Fishermen, for the same Reason.  
3. Merchants &amp; Traders, in unarm’d Ships; who accommodate different Nations by communicating &amp; exchanging the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life.  
4. Artists &amp; Mechanics, inhabiting &amp; working in open Towns.  
It is hardly necessary to add that the Hospitals of Enemies should be unmolested; they ought to be assisted.  
In short, I would have nobody fought with but those who are paid for Fighting. If obliged to take Corn from the Farmer, Friend or Enemy, I would pay him for it; the same for the Fish or Goods of the others.  
This once established, that Encouragement to war which arises from Spirit of Rapine would be taken away, and Peace therefore more likely to continue &amp; be lasting
