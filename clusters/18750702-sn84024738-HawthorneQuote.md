 by that name.  
There is nothing that wears out a fine face  
like the vigils of a card table and those cut  
ting passions which naturally attend them.  
Haggard looks and pale complexions are the  
natural indications of a female gamester.  
Among all other virtues, humility, the  
lowest, is preeminent; it is the safest, be­  
cause it is always at anchor, and that man  
may be truly said to live the most content  
in his calling that strives to live within the  
compass of it.  
What is commonly called friendship is no  
more than a partnership, a reciprocal regard  
for one another&#x27;s interests, and an exchange  
of good offices; in a word, a mere traffic,  
wherein self-love always proposes to be a  
gainer.  
As laughter enables mirth and surprise to  
breathe freely, so tears enable sorrow to vent  
itself patiently. Tears hinder sorrow from  
becoming despair, and laughter is one of the  
privileges of reason confined to the human  
species.  
Thousands of people might be enjoying  
reasonable lives, with opportunities for self-  
  
culture, for social enjoyment and for chari­  
table efforts, whose whole energy is absorbed  
in the desperate struggle to add superfluities  
to comforts.  
The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the  
doubt whether one may not be going to  
prove one&#x27;s self a fool; the truest heroism is  
to resist the doubt, and the profoundest wis­  
dom to know when it ought to be resisted

asked concerning Mr. Moody&#x27;s work at

faith. Then on his return Air. Moody  
creates a fresh interest, and  
evangelises at Chicago to good purpose,
