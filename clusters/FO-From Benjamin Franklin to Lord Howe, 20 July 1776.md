 the commissioners; that, very unfortunately, a long passage prevented his arriving here before the declaration of independence took place.. . . I told him he had now a fair opportunity to mention to his friend Dr. Franklin, in a private letter, his design in coming out, and what his expectations from America were. This he declined; saying the doctor had grown too warm, and if he expressed his sentiments fully to him, he should only give him pain, which he would wish to avoid.”  
  
My Lord,  
Philada. July 20th. 1776.  
I received safe the Letters your Lordship so kindly forwarded to me, and beg you to accept my Thanks.  
The Official Dispatches to which you refer me, contain nothing more than what we had seen in the Act of Parliament, viz. Offers of Pardon upon Submission; which I was sorry to find, as it must give your Lordship Pain to be sent so far on so hopeless a Business.  
Directing Pardons to be offered the Colonies, who are the very Parties injured, expresses indeed that Opinion of our Ignorance, Baseness, and Insensibility which your uninform’d and proud Nation has long been pleased to entertain of us; but it can have no other Effect than that of increasing our Resentment. It is impossible we should think of Submission to a Government, that has with the most wanton Barbarity and Cruelty, burnt our defenceless Towns in the midst of Winter, excited the Savages to massacre our Farmers, and our Slaves to murder their Masters, and is even now bringing foreign Mercenaries to deluge our Settlements with Blood. These atrocious Injuries have extinguished every remaining Spark of Affection for that Parent Country we once held so dear: But were it possible for us to forget and forgive them, it is not possible for you (I mean the British Nation) to forgive the People you have so heavily injured; you can never confide again in those as Fellow Subjects, and permit them to enjoy equal Freedom, to whom you know you have given such just Cause of lasting Enmity. And this must impel you, were we again under your Government, to endeavour the breaking our Sprit by the severest Tyranny, and obstructing by every means in your Power our growing Strength and Prosperity.  
  
But your Lordship mentions “the Kings paternal Solicitude for promoting the Establishment of lasting Peace and Union with the Colonies.” If by Peace is here meant, a Peace to be entered into between Britain and America as distinct States now at War, and his Majesty has given your Lordship Powers to treat with us of such a Peace, I may venture to say, tho’ without Authority, that I think a Treaty for that purpose not yet quite impracticable, before we enter into Foreign Alliances. But I am persuaded you have no such Powers. Your Nation, tho’ by punishing those American Governors who have created and fomented the Discord, rebuilding our burnt Towns, and repairing as far as possible the Mischiefs done us, She might yet recover a great Share of our Regard and the greatest part of our growing Commerce, with all the Advantage of that additional Strength to be derived from a Friendship with us; I know too well her abounding Pride and deficient Wisdom, to believe she will ever take such Salutary Measures. Her Fondness for Conquest as a Warlike Nation, her Lust of Dominion as an Ambitious one, and her Thirst for a gainful Monopoly as a Commercial one, (none of them legitimate Causes of War) will all join to hide from her Eyes every View of her true Interests; and continually goad her on in these ruinous distant Expeditions, so destructive both of Lives and Treasure, that must prove as perrnicious to her in the End as the Croisades formerly were to most of the Nations of Europe.   
I have not the Vanity, my Lord, to think of intimidating by thus predicting the Effects of this War; for I know it will in England have the Fate of all my former Predictions, not to be believed till the Event shall verify it.  
Long did I endeavour with unfeigned and unwearied Zeal, to preserve from breaking, that fine and noble China Vase the British Empire: for I knew that being once broken, the separate Parts could not retain even their Share of the Strength or Value that existed in the Whole, and that a perfect Re-Union of those Parts could scarce even be hoped for. Your Lordship may possibly remember the Tears of Joy that wet my Cheek, when, at your good Sister’s in London, you once gave me Expectations that a Reconciliation might soon take place. I had the Misfortune to find those Expectations disappointed, and to be treated as the Cause of the Mischief I was labouring to prevent. My Consolation under that groundless and malevolent Treatment was, that I retained the Friendship of many Wise and Good Men in that Country, and among the rest some Share in the Regard of Lord Howe.  
The well founded Esteem, and permit me to say Affection, which I shall always have for your Lordship, makes it painful to me to see you engag’d in conducting a War, the great Ground of which, as expressed in your Letter, is, “the Necessity of preventing the American Trade from passing into foreign Channels.” To me it seems that neither the obtaining or retaining of any Trade, how valuable soever, is an Object for which Men may justly Spill each others Blood; that the true and sure means of extending and securing Commerce is the goodness and cheapness of Commodities; and that the profits of no Trade can ever be equal to the Expence of compelling it, and of holding it, by Fleets and Armies. I consider this War against us therefore, as both unjust, and unwise; and I am persuaded cool dispassionate Posterity will condemn to Infamy those who advised it; and that even Success will not save from some degree of Dishonour, those who voluntarily engag’d to conduct it. I know your great Motive in coming hither was the Hope of being instrumental in a Reconciliation; and I believe when you find that impossible on any Terms given you to propose, you will relinquish so odious a Command, and return to a more honourable private Station. With the greatest and most sincere Respect I have the honour to be, My Lord your Lordships most obedient humble Servant  
B Franklin  
honble. Lord How

Philadelphia, Fuly 40, 1776.  
I Received fafe the letters your Lord-  
thip fo kindly forwarded to me, and  
beg you to accept my thanks.  
  
The official difpatches to which you  
refer me, contain nothing more than  
what we had {een in the act of parlia-  
ment, viz. offers of pardon upon fub-  
mifion ; which I was forry to find, as  
it muft give your Lordship pain to be  
fent fo far on fo hopelefs a bufinefs.  
  
Direéting pardons to be offered to  
the colonies,+who are the very parties  
injured, expreffes indeed that opinion  
  
  
  
  
  
169  
of our ignorance, bafenefs, and infen-  
fibility, which your uninformed and  
proud nation has long been pleafed to  
entertain of us; but it can have no o-  
ther effeét than that of increafing our re-  
fentments. It is impoflible we fhould  
think of fubmiffion to a Government  
that has, with the moft wanton barba-  
rity and cruelty, burnt our defencelefs  
towns, in the midft of winter; excited  
the favages to maffacre our peaceful  
farmers, and our flaves to murder their  
mafters ; and is even now bringing  
foreign mercenaries to deluge our fet-  
tlements with blood. Thefe atroci-  
ous injuries have extinguifhed every  
fpark of affection for that parent-  
country we once held fo dear: but  
were it poflible for us to forget and .  
forgive them, it is not poffible for  
you, I mean the Britifh nation, to for-  
give the people you have fo heavily in-  
jured : you can never confide again in  
thofe as fellow-fubjects, and permit  
them to enjoy equal freedom, to whom,  
you know, you have given fuch juft  
caufes of lafting enmity ; and this  
mutt impel you, were we again under  
your government, to endeavour the  
breaking our fpirit, by the fevereft ty-  
ranny, and obitruéting, by every means.  
in your power, our growing ftrength  
and profperity.  
  
But your Lordfhip mentions the  
King’s paternal folicitude for promo-  
ting the eftablifhment of lafting peace  
and union with the colonies. If by  
peace is here meant a peace to be enter-  
ed into by diftinct ftates, now at war,  
and his Majefty has given your Lord-  
fhip power to treat with us of fuch a  
peace, I may venture to fay, though  
without authority, that I think a treaty  
for that purpofe not quite imprattica-  
ble, before we enter into foreign alli-  
ances: but I am perfuaded you have  
nofuch powers. Your nation, though  
by punifhing thofe American Gover-  
nors who have fomented the difcord,  
rebuilding our burnt towns, and re-  
pairing, as far as poflible, the mifchief  
done us, fhe might recover a great fhare  
of our regard, and the greatett fhare of  
our growing commerce, with all the  
advantages of that additional ftrength  
to be derived from a friendfhip with  
us ; yet I know too well her abound-  
ing pride, and deficient wifdom, te  
believe the will ever take fuch falutary

commercial one, (none of them legiti-  
mate caufes of war,) will all join to  
hide from her eyes every view of her  
true intereft, and will continually goad  
her on, in thefe ruinous, diftant expe-  
ditions, fo deftruétive both of lives,  
and of treafure, that they muf prove as  
pernicious to.her in the end, as the  
Croifades formerly were to moft of the  
nations of Europe.  
  
I have not the vanity, my Lord, to  
think of intimidating, by thus prediét-  
ing the effects of this war; for I know  
it will in England have the fate of all  
my former prediétions, not to be belie-  
ved, till the event fhall verify it.  
  
Long did I endeavour, with un-  
feigned and unwearied zeal, to preferve  
from breaking that fine and noble  
china vafe~the Britih empire; for  
1 know, that, being once broken, the  
feparate parts could not retain even  
their thares of the ftrength and value  
that exifted in the whole; and that a  
perfeét re-union of thefe parts could  
fcarce ever be hoped for. Your Lord  
fhip may poflibly remember the tears  
of joy that wet my cheek, when, at  
your good fifter’s, in London, you  
once gave me expectations that a recon-  
ciliation might foon take place. I had  
  
~ the misfortune to find thefe expectations  
difappointed, and to be treated as the  
caule of the mifchief I was labouring to  
  
prevent. My confolation under that  
groundlefs and malevolent treatment  
was, that I retained the friendfhip of  
many wife and good men in that coun-  
try, and, among the reft, fome fhare in  
the regard of Lord Howe.  
  
The well-founded efteem, and, per-  
mit me to fay, affe&amp;tion, which I fhall  
always have for your Lordfhip, make  
it painful for me to fee you engaged in  
conducting a war, the great ground of  
which, a@ defcribed in your letter, is  
  
\ the neceflity of preventing the Ameri-  
can trade from pafling into foreign  
channels: to me it feems that neither  
the obtaining nor retaining any trade,  
how valuable foever, is an object for  
which men may juftly fpiil each other’s  
blood ; that the true and fure means of  
extending and fecuring commerce, are  
the goodnefs and cheapnefs of commo-  
dities ; and that the profits of no trade  
can ever be equal to the expence of  
compelling it, and holding it by fleets  
and armies. I confider this war againit  
ue, therefore, as both unjuft and un-  
wife ; and I am perfuaded that cool and  
d-fpaffionate potterity will condemn to  
infamy thofe who advifed it ; and that  
  
Dr, Franklin’s Anfwer to Lord Howe. ~  
  
even fuccefs will not fave from fome  
degree of difhonour thofe who have vo-  
luntarily engaged to condué&amp; it.  
  
I know your great motive in coming  
hither was the hope of being inftrue  
mental in a reconciliation ; and bee  
lieve, when you find that to.be impofhi-  
ble, on any terms given you to pro-  
pofe, you will relinquith fo odious a  
command, and return to a more ho-  
nourable private ftation.  
  
With the greateft and moft fincere  
refpect, I have the honour to be,  
  
My Lord, &amp;c. &amp;c

Received Piafe Sas’ Baber your

‘The official difpatches, to which  
  
you refer me, contain nothing more  
  
‘than what we had feen in the att of  
  
arta. viz. offers of pardon on  
ubmiffion ; which I was forry to find,  
as it mufl give your lordfhip pain to  
pte fo far on fo hopelefs a buli-

Dire@ing pardons to be offered to  
the colonies, who ate the very par-  
ties injured, exprefles indeed that o-  
  
ion of dur ignorance, bafenefs, and  
infenfibility, which your uninformed  
and proud nation has long been pleaf-  
ed to entertain of us; but it can  
have no other effeét than that of in-  
créafing our refentments, It is impoffi&lt;  
ble we fhould think of fubmiffion toa  
government that has, with the molt  
wanton barbarity and cruelty, burnt  
out defencelefs towns in the midh o  
winter, excited the favages to maffa-  
cre our peaceful farmers, and our  
flaves to murder their mafters ; and  
is even now fending fereign mercena-  
ries todeluge our country with blood.  
Thefe atrocious injuries have extin-  
gaint every {park of affettion for  
that parent country we once held fo  
dear: but, were it pofhble for us to  
forget and forgive them, it is not pof-  
fible for vou, } mean the Britifh na-

confide again in thofe as fellow fub-

fréedom, to whom, you know. vou  
have given fuch juft caufes of laiting  
enmity; and this muft impel you,

a great {hare of our regard, and the  
greatelt fhare of our growing com-

additional ftrength to be deuved from  
a friendfhip with us: yet I know too  
well herabounding pride, and defici-  
ent wifdom, to beheve the will ever  
take fuch falutary meafures. Her  
fondnefs for conqueft, as a warlike  
nation—her Juft for dominion, as an

one—(none of them legitimate caufes

‘TL received safe the letters your lordship so  
  
kindly forwarded to me, and beg you to accept  
  
‘ my thanks.  
  
  
  
  
  
Rid THE NATIONAL REGISTER.  
  
“ The official despatches to which you refer  
me, contain nothing more than what we had seen  
in the act of parliament ; ‘viz. ‘Offers of pardon  
upon submission ;” which I am sorry to find, as it  
must give your lordship pain, to be sent so far on  
  
so hopeless a business.  
  
“ Directing pardons to be offered to the colo-  
nies, who are the very parties injured, expresses  
indeed, that opinion of our ignorance, baseness  
and insensibility, which your uniformed arsl  
  
proud nation has long been pleased to entertain  
  
of us; but it can have no other effect than that  
  
of increasing our resentments. It is impossible  
  
we should think of submission, to a government  
  
that has, with the most wanton barbarity and  
crue&#x27;ty, burned our defenceless towns in the  
midst of winter : excited the Savages ty massacre  
  
our peaceful farmers, and our slaves to murder  
  
their masters ; and is even now bringing foreign  
mercenaries to deluge our settlement with blood.  
These «trociousinjuries have extinguished every  
spark of affection for that parent country, that  
we once held so dear; but were it possible for  
us to forget and forgive them, it is not possible  
for you, I mean the Briltsh nation, to forgive the  
people you have so heavily injured.  
never confide again in those, as fellow subjects,  
and permit them to enjoy ejual freedom, to  
whom you know you have given such just causes  
of lasting enmity ; and this must impel you, were  
we again under your government, to endeavor  
to break our spirit by the severest tyranny, and  
obstructing by every means in your power, our  
growing strength and prosperity.  
  
“ Your lordship mentions “ the king’s paternal  
solicitude for promoting the establishment of last-  
ing peace and union with the colonies.” If, by peace,  
be hear meant, 2 peace to be entered into by dis-  
¢inct states, now at war, and his majesty has given  
your lordship powers to treat with us, of such a  
peace, I may venture to say, though without au-  
thority, that I think a treaty for that purpose not  
quite impracticable, before we enter into foreign  
alliances : but I am persuaded you have no such  
  
wers.—Your nation, thought by punishing those  
American governors, who have fomented the dis-  
cord; rebuilding our burnt towns : and repairing,  
as far as possible, the mischicfs done us, she might  
recover a great share of our regard, and the great-  
ést share of our growing commerce, with all the  
advantages of that additional sivength to be deriv  
ed from a friendship with us, yet, I know too well  
her abounding pride and deficient wisdom, to be-  
lieve she will ever take such salutary measures.  
Her fondness for conqvest, as a warlike nation;  
her lust of dominion, as an ambitious one ; and  
her thirst for a gainful monopoly, as a commercial  
ene, none of them legitimate causes of war, will

be hoped for. Your lordship may possibly re ener  
ber the tears of joy that wetted my cheek Pa  
at your good sister’s in London, you once gave ~*~  
expectations that a reconciliation might take —  
I had the misfortune to find these expectat e.  
disappointed, and to be treated as the cause of -  
mischief I was laboring to prevent. My cosh.  
tion, under that groundless and malevolent treat.  
ment, was that I retained the friendship of ma c  
wise and good men, in that country, and amo  
the rest, some shure in the regard of lord Howe  
“The well founded esteem, and permit me ©  
say, affection, which I shall always have for your  
lordship, make it painful to me to see you engag-  
ed in conducting a war the great ground of which  
as described in your letter, is “the necessity af  
preventing the American trade from passing into  
foreign channels.” To me it seems that neither  
the obtaining or retaining any trade, how valua.  
ble soe ver, is an object for which men, may just.  
ly spill each other’s b.ood; that the true and  
sure means of extending and securing commerce  
are the goodness and cheapness of commodities;  
and that the profits of no trade can ever be equal  
to the expense of compelling it, and holding it by  
fleets and armies. I consider this war against ys,  
therefore, as both unjust and unwise ; and I am  
persuaded that cool and dispassionate posterity  
will condemn to infamy those who advised it ; and  
that even success will not save from some degree  
of dishonor those who have voluntarily engaged  
to conduct it.  
“I know your great motive in coming hither  
was the hope of being instrumental in a reconcil-  
iation ; and, I believe, when you find that to be  
impossible, on any terms given you to propose,  
  
  
  
you will then relinquish so odious a command,  
and return toa more honorable private station.

neither the obtaining or retaining any trade, how valua­

each other&#x27;s blood;that the true and sure means of extend­

ness of commodities, and tiiat the profits of no trade can  
ever be equal to the expense of compelling it, and holding  
it by fleets and armies. I consider this war against us  
therefore as both unjust and unwise; and I am persua­

infamy those who advised it; and that even success will

nation has long been pleased to entertain of us; but  
it can have no other effect than that of increasing

If a peace is here meant a peace to be entered into  
by distinct States, now at war, and his Majesty has

such a peace, I may venture to say, though with-  
out authority, that I think a treaty for that pur-

tary measures. Her fondness for conquest, as a  
warlike nation ; her lust of dominion, as an ambi-  
tious one ; and her thirst for a gainful monopoly,  
as a commercial one (none of them legitimate  
causes of war), will all join to hide from her eyes  
every view of her true interest, and will continu-  
ally goad her on, in these ruinous, distant expedi-

that they must prove as pernicious to her in the

nations of Europe.’’ I have not the vanity, my  
Lord, to think of intimidating, by thus predicting  
the effects of this war; for I know it will in Eng-  
land have the fate of all my former predictions,  
not to be believed, till the event shall verify it.  
Long did I endeavour with unfeigned and unwea-  
ried zeal, to preserve from breaking that fine and  
noble China vase—the British empire ; for I know,  
that being once broken, the separate parts could  
not retain even their shares of the strength and  
value that existed in the whole; and that a per-  
fect reunion of these parts could scarce ever be  
hoped for. Your Lordship may possibly remem-  
ber the tears of joy that wet my cheek, when at  
your good sister’s, in London, you once gave me  
expectations that a reconciliation might soon take  
place. I had the misfortune to find these expec-  
tations disappointed, and to be treated as the cause  
of the mischief I was labouring to prevent. My  
consolation under that groundless and malevolent  
treatment was, that I retained the friendship of many  
wise and good men in that country, and, among  
the rest, some share in the regard of Lord Howe.  
  
‘* The well founded esteem, and, permit me to  
say, affection, which I shall always have for your  
Lordship, make it painful for me to see you en-  
gaged in conducting a war, the great ground of  
which, as described in your letter, is ‘the necessity  
of preventing the American trade from passing  
into foreign channels ;’ tome it seems that neither  
the obtaining nor retaining any trade, how valua-  
ble soever, is an object for which men may justly  
spill each other’s blood ; that the true and sure  
means of extending and securing commerce, are

therefore, as both unjust and unwise; and I am  
persuaded that cool and dispassionate posterity  
will condemn to infamy those who advised it, and  
that even success will not save from some degree  
of dishonor those who have voluntarily engaged to  
conduct it.  
  
‘‘T know your great motive in coming hither  
was the hope of being instrumental in a reconcili-  
tion; and believe, when you find that to be im-  
  
  
  
possible, in any terms given you to propose, you  
will relinquish so odious a command, and return  
to a more honourable private station.  
  
‘* With the greatest and most sincere respect, .  
  
I have the honour to be,  
My Lord,  
Your Lordship’s most obedient  
humble servant,  
B. FRANKLIN.”’

deed, that opinion of our ignorance, baseness,  
and insensibility, which your uninformed and  
proud nation has been pleased to entertain of us;

Keen hammering awny. even at the  
risk of being deemed a victim of  
crotchets. For this Is not anover-ln-telllgent  
world. John Flske.  
It is sad to see our government  
backing those whoso avowed policy is  
expansion, which, less politely ex  
pressed, means aggression, anu tor  
which there is a still less oolite word  
which is readily guessed. Herbert  
Spencer,  
t would not trnde a single sentence  
of the declaration of Independence tor  
all the gold that could come from me  
Philippines in a thousand years.  
William J. Bryan.  
If there is anything that cannot bear  
free thought, let It crack. Wendell  
Phillips.  
To me it seems that neither the ob­  
taining nor retaining of any trade,  
how valuable soever, is an object for  
which men may justly spill each  
other&#x27;s blood; that tho true and sure  
means of extending and securing com­  
merce is the goodness nnd cheapness of  
commodities, and that the profit of  
no trade can ever be equal to the ex­  
pense of compelling it and of holding  
It by fleets and armies Benjami
