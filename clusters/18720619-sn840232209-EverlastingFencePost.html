Everlasting Fence Posts.<br/>
There is a peculiar satisfaction<br/>
in listening to the conversation or<br/>
reading the writings of positive<br/>
men, or of those who deal in facts<br/>
as have but one side and no excep­<br/>
tion. Such a man tells ns, in the<br/>
Western Rural, how to preserve<br/>
posts for fences, etc. He says:<br/>
I discovered many years ago that<br/>
wood can be made to last longer<br/>
than iron in tho ground, but<br/>
thought the process so simple and<br/>
inexpensive tha, it was not worth<br/>
while to make any stir about it. I<br/>
would as soon have poplar or ash as<br/>
any kind of timber for post. I have<br/>
taken out basswood posts after hav­<br/>
ing been set seven years that were<br/>
as sound as when put in the ground.<br/>

no effect on them. Ths posts can<br/>
be repaired for less than two cents. &#x27;<br/>
