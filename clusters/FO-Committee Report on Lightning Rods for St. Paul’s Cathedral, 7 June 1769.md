ot easily have been obtained.  
As all metals are now known readily to conduct or transmit the electric fluid, or, which is the same thing, lightning, through them; the large quantity of lead, and some iron, disposed in different parts of St. Paul’s church, will, by having its several parts connected, where there is at present no such connection, prevent the erecting a considerable part of the apparatus, which otherwise we should judge absolutely necessary.  
We are of opinion that, caeteris paribus, all buildings upon the same level are liable to be injured by lightning in proportion to their height: and that the danger is increased by crosses, weather-cocks, or pieces of metal, in any form, placed upon or near their tops, unless there is a compleat metallic communication from these to the bottom of the building, which metal should terminate either in water, or moist ground.  
In St. Paul’s church, the objects of our more particular attention were the dome and its lanthern, and the two towers at the west end. The roof over the body of the church, being compleatly covered with lead, will, we conceive, prevent mischief thereto from lightning; and the more so, as the lead on the roof joins to that of the several leaden spouts, which come down the sides of the building, and terminate in the ground at a considerable depth. For our more certain information, one of these spouts was examined; and it was found to descend perpendicularly about three feet under the surface of the earth: and then, after being laid about seven feet in an inclined direction, it ended in a brick drain, which communicates with the sewer. These circumstances induce us to conclude, that what has been just now described is a sufficient metallic communication between the roof of the church and the ground.  
No part of this whole fabric seems to be in so dangerous a situation of being injured by lightning, as the stone lanthern placed above the dome. This danger arises not only from its height, but from the different pieces of metal in different parts of it, being at present detached and separated from each other. This stone lanthern is supported by a truncated cone of brick-work, of no more than eighteen inches, or two bricks, thick. To the honour, however, of the architectural sagacity of Sir Christopher Wren, who was formerly our President, this support of the lanthern, which has already stood much above half a century, has not in the least given way in any of its parts. How far it would sustain the violence of a stroke of lightning will, it is to be hoped, never be tried: and what we have now to propose will, we flatter ourselves, lessen the probability of its being injured by it. The first object of our attention, therefore, was to make a compleat metallic communication between the cross, placed over this lanthern, and the leaden covering of the great dome; as from its height, if any lightning was in its neighbourhood, it would most probably affect the cross.  
This cross with the ball, both composed of metal, are supported by, and connected with, seven iron rods. These descend perpendicularly through the small leaden dome, which covers the lanthern, and are inserted into and pass through a strong frame of timber, placed horizontally under that dome. The lower extremities of these iron rods are fastened to the under surface of this timber frame with iron nuts and screws.  
From this timber work, several large iron bars, placed at some distance from the ends of the above-mentioned iron rods, descend obliquely, and are fixed in the stone-work of the lanthern. The upper ends of each of these oblique iron bars pass through the frame of timber before mentioned, and are fastened to its upper surface with iron nuts and screws. Between these iron bars and the leaden covering of the great dome, there is at present no metallic communication. To this arrangement, therefore, is owing the danger from lightning, which the Committee apprehends that this part of the building is liable to. To obviate which, we are of opinion, that four additional iron bars, each not less than an inch square, should be securely placed over the frame of timber before mentioned in such a manner, that one end of each of these four additional iron bars may be in contact with one of the perpendicular iron rods, and the other end of each be in contact with one of the iron nuts and screws, which fasten the obliquely descending iron bars to this frame of timber. At the bottom of these oblique iron bars, just above where they are inserted into the stone-work, the Committee recommends, that a ring, made of bar iron, of about an inch square, should be placed so as to be fastened to, and be in contact with, these iron bars.  
From this proposed ring to the upper part of the lead which covers the great cupola, the distance is about forty-eight feet. In this space, we are of opinion, that four iron bars should be placed, each not less than an inch square. These should be fixed within the lanthern in such a manner, that the upper end of each should be fastened to, and in contact with, the iron ring before mentioned, and their lower ends in contact with the lead on the upper part of the cupola; from which the metallic communication is compleat to the lower end of the pipes, that discharge the water from the circular part of the great cupola, upon the floor of the stone gallery.  
From the bottoms of these pipes, which terminate with a shoe of lead within half a foot of the floor of the stone gallery, the metallic communication is again interrupted to the top of the leaden pipes, which convey the water from thence. Here it is proposed, that conductors of lead, not less than four inches in breadth and half an inch in thickness, should be placed so as to be in contact with the bottom of four of the pipes that come from above, and with the top of four of those that descend. Lead is recommended to be employed here, as more readily adapting itself to the various curvatures it must meet with in the now proposed arrangement.  
These last pipes, after descending below the colonnade, near the circular stair-cases, make their appearance upon the outside of the drum-part of the cupola; where they are bent at obtuse angles, and discharge their water upon the roof of the church. From these angles to the roof the distance is about five feet. Here then is another interruption to the metallic communication. This is proposed to be compleated by conductors of lead, similar to those before mentioned, which should be so placed as to be in contact both with the bottom of the pipes and the adjoining roof.  
From the roof, as has already been mentioned, the leaden pipes are continued below the surface of the earth, and terminate in a drain; and thus, by the method now directed, the metallic communication will be compleated from the cross on the top of St. Paul’s church to some feet below the surface of the ground.  
The Committee then turned their thoughts towards the two towers at the west end of the church; and here they beg leave to observe, that in one of these towers, between the pine apple and the leaden bell-shaped covering near it, placed at the top of each of these towers, there is no metallic communication deserving notice, till you come to the lead on the roof of the church. This distance is eighty-eight feet. To this tower, therefore, it is proposed to adapt a droor bar of iron, not less than an inch and a quarter square, in such a manner that one end of the bar should be in contact with the metal communicating with the pine apple on its top, which is of copper, and the other end with the lead on the roof of the church.  
In the middle of the other tower, in which the great bell is hung, there is an iron stair-case of considerable height, which is placed in the middle of it, in order for the more conveniently coming at the clock-work. The top of this stair-case is at no great distance from the leaden covering upon the top of the tower: but from the bottom of this stair-case to the roof of the church, between which there is no metallic communication, the distance is considerable, not less than forty feet. The Committee recommend, therefore, that a bar of iron, of an inch and a quarter square, may be placed between the pine-apple, or the lead in contact with it, and the upper part of this stair-case; and that another iron bar, similar to this last, may be adjusted so, as to pass from the bottom of the stair-case to the lead on the roof of the church. The roof, as has been already mentioned, communicates with the leaden pipes, and these with the ground.  
These towers, from their near situation to the cupola, which is a building so much higher, may possibly be less liable to mischiefs from lightning than if they were erected at a more considerable distance. As the direction of the lightning is, however, uncertain, from a variety of causes, as also to what extent one building will protect another, the Committee are of opinion, that this apparatus to the towers will be expedient.  
It is to be remarked, that wherever iron is employed as a conductor of lightning, especial care must be taken to prevent its becoming rusty; as, from being long exposed to the moist atmosphere, it will be corroded to a considerable depth: and so much of the iron as is corroded ceases to be of use as a conductor; the Committee therefore have, in directing the size of these iron bars, made some allowance for the waste of the iron by rust.  
The size, as well as number, of the iron bars recommended here by the Committee, are only to be considered as applicable to St. Paul’s, and not as a standard for any church or building of less dimensions; as in these last, conductors of a smaller size, and fewer in number, may answer the purpose as securely as the larger. But St. Paul’s church is particularly circumstanced: it is an edifice not only of great height, but its cupola, to say nothing of the lead on the body of the church, presents a large surface of metal to the clouds; on which account it is very liable to receive greater quantities of the electric fluid; and, from large quantities of such an elastic power, great mischiefs may arise to this magnificent building, in consequence of obstructions the fluid may meet with in passing through it. For these reasons we have recommended very large conductors, that it may pass through them into the ground, as readily as it enters.  
These, Sir, are our sentiments in rela

to take the above obje&amp; into confideration.  
  
* As all metals are now known readily to conduét or tranf-  
mit the eleétric fluid, or, which is the fame thing, lightning,  
through them; the large quantity of lead, and fome iron,  
difpoied in different parts of St, Paul’s church, will, by having  
its feveral parts conne&amp;ted, where there is at prefent no fuch  
_connegtion, prevent the erecting a confiderable part of the  
-apparatus, which otherwife we fhould judge abfolutely ne-  
ceflary.  
  
‘ Weare of opinion that, cereris paribus, all buildings upon  
the faine level are liable to be injured by lightning in propor-  
tion to their height: and that the danger is -increafed by  
crofles, weather-cocks, or pieces of metal, in any form,  
placed upon or near their tops, unlefs there is a compieat me-  
tallic communication from thefe to the bottom of the building,  
which metal fhould terminate either in water, or moift ground.  
  
‘ In St. Paul’s church, the obje&amp;s of our more particular  
attention were the dome and its lanthern, and the two towers  
at the weftend. ‘The roof over the body of the church, be-  
ing compleatly covered with lead, will, we conceive, prevent  
-mifchief thereto from lightning ; and the more fo, as the lead  
on the roof joins to that of the feveral leaden fpouts, which  
come down the fides of the building, and terminate in the  
ground at aconfiderable depth. For our more certain infor-  
mation, one of thefe fpouts was examined; and it was found  
to defcend perpendicularly about three feet under the furface  
  
of

of the earth: and then, after being laid about feven feet in an  
inclined dire€tion, it ended in a brick drain, which commu-  
nicates with the fewer. Thefe circumftances induce us to con-  
clude, that what has been juft now defcribed is .a fufficient  
metallic communication between the roof of the church and  
the ground.  
  
‘ No part of this whole fabric feems to be in fo dangerous  
a fituation of being injured by lightning, as the ftone lan-  
thern placed above the dome. ‘This danger arifes not only  
from its height, but from the different pieces of metal in dif-  
ferent parts of it, being at prefent detached and feparated  
from each other. This ftone lanthern is fupported by a trun-  
cated cone of brick-work, of no more than eighteen inches, of  
two bricks, thick. To the honour, however, of the archi-  
tectural fagacity of Sir Chriftopher Wren, who was formerly  
our prefident, this fupport of the lanthern, which has already  
ftood much above half a century, has not in the leaft given  
way in any of its parts. How far it would fuftain the violence  
of a ftroke of lightning will, it is to be hoped, never be tried :  
and what we have now to propofe will, we flatter ourfelves,  
leffen the probability of its being injured by it. The firft ob-  
je&amp;t of our attention, therefore, was to make a compleat me-  
tallic communication between the crofs, placed over this lan-  
thern, and the leaden covering of the great dome ; as from  
its height, if any lightning was in its neighbourhood, it would -  
probably affe&amp; the crofs.  
  
‘ This crofs with the ball, both compofed of metal, are  
fupported by, and connected with, feven iron rods, Thefe  
defcend perpendicularly through the fmall leaden dome, which  
covers the lanthern, and are inferted into and pafs through a  
ftrong frame of timber, and placed horizontally under that  
dome. ‘The lower extremities of thefe iron rods are faftened  
to the under furface of this timber frame with iron nuts and  
fcrews.  
  
‘ From this timber work, feveral large iron bars, placed at  
fome diftance from the ends of the above mentioned iron rods,  
defcend obliquely, and are fixed in the ftone-work of the lan-  
thern. The upper ends of each of thefe oblique iron bars pafs  
through the frame of timber before-mentionied, and are  
faftened to its upper furface with iron nuts and fcrews. Be-  
tween thefe iron bars and the leaden covering of the great  
dome, there is at prefent no metallic communication. To  
this arrangement, therefore, is owing the danger from light-  
ning, which the committee apprehends that this part of the  
building is liable to. To obviate which, we are of opinion,  
that four additional iron bars, each pot lefs than an inch  
  
N 2 fquare,  
  
  
  
180 Pbil-fophical Tranfa@tions, Vel, LIX. Part I.  
  
fquare, fhould be fecurely placed over the frame of timber be-  
fore mentioned in fuch a manner, that one end of each of thefé  
four additional iron bars may be in conta&amp; with one of the  
perpendicular iron rods, and the other end of each be in con-  
tact with one of the iron nuts and forews, which faften the  
obliquely defcending iron bars to this frame of timber. At the  
bottom of thefe oblique iron bars, juft above -where they are  
inferted into the ftone-work, the committee recommends, that  
aring, made of bar iron, of about an inch fquare, thould be  
placed fo as to be faftened to, and be in contaét it, thefe iron  
bars.  
  
‘ From this propofed ring to the upper part of the lead  
which covers the great cupola, the diltance is about forty-  
eight feet. In this fpace, we are of opinion, that four iron  
bars fhould be placed, each not lefs than an inch fquare.  
Thefe fhould be fixed within the lanthern in fuch a manner,  
that the upper end of each thould be faftened to, and in con-  
taét with, the iron ring before-mentioned, and their lower  
ends in contaét with the lead on the upper part of the cupola;  
from which the metallic communication is compleat to the  
lower end of the pipes, that difcharge the water from the cir-  
cular part of the great cupola, upon the floor of the ftone  
gallery.  
  
‘ From the bottoms of thefe pipes, which terminate with.a  
fhoe of lead within half a foot of the floor of the ftone gallery,  
the metallic communication is again interrupted to the top of  
the leaden pipes, which convey the water from thence. Here  
it is propofed, that conduGors of lead, not lefs than four,  
inches in breadth and half an inch in thicknefs, fhould be  
placed fo as to be in conta&amp; with the bottom of four of. the  
pipes that come from above, and with the top of four of thofe  
that defcend. Lead is recommended to be employed here, as;  
more readily adapting itfelf to the various curvatures it muft:  
meet with in the now propofed arrangement.  
  
* Thefe laft pipes, after defcending below the colonade,  
near the circular ftair cafes, make their appearance upon the  
outfide of the drum-part of the cupo!a; where they are bent at  
obtufe angles, and difcharge their water upon the roof of the  
church, From thefe angles to the roof the diftance is about  
five feet. Here then is another interruption to the metallic  
communication. This is propofed to be compleated by con-  
duétors of lead, fimilar to thofe before-mentioned, which  
fhould be fo placed as to be in contact both with the bottom  
of the pipes and the adjoining roof.  
  
_* From the rcof, as has already been mentioned, the leaden  
pipes are continued below the furface of the earth, and ter-

minate in a drain; and thus, by the method now direéted,  
the metallic communication will be compleated from‘ the crofs  
on the top of St. Paul’s church to fome feet below the furface  
of the ground.  
  
‘ The committee then turned their thoughts towards the  
two towers at the weft end of the church; and here they beg  
leave to obferve, that in one of thefe towers, between the pine  
apple and the leaden bell-fhaped covering near it, placed at  
the top of each of thefe towers, there is no metallic commus  
hication deferving notice, till you come to the lead on the  
roof of the church. This diftance is eighty-eizght feet. To  
this tower, therefore, it is propofed to adapta rod or bar of  
iron, not lefs than an inch and a quarter fquare, in fuch a  
manner that one end of the bar fhould be in conta&amp; with the  
metal communicating with the pine apple on its top, which is  
of copper, and the other end with the lead on the roof of the  
church.  
  
‘ In the middle of the other tower, in which the great bell  
is hung, there is an iron ftair-cafe of confiderable héight,  
which is placed in the middle of it, in order for the more con-  
veniently coming at the clock-work. ‘The top of this ftairé  
cafe is at no great diftance from the leaden covering upon the  
top of the tower: but from the bottom of this ftair cafe to the  
roof. of the church, between which there is no metallic com-  
munication, the diftance is confiderable, not lefs than forty  
feet. The committee recommend, therefore, that a bar of  
iron, of an inch and a quarter fquare, may be placed between  
the pine apple, or the lead in conta&amp; with it, and the upper  
part of this ftair-cafe ; and that another iron bar, fimilar to  
this laft, may be adjufted fo, as to pafs from the bottom of  
the ftair-cafe to the lead on the roof of the church. The roof,  
as has been already mentioned, ‘communicates with the leaden  
pipes, and thefe with the ground.  
  
‘ Thefe towers, from their near fituation to the cupola,  
which is a building fo much higher, may poflibly be lefs liable  
to milchiefs from lightning than if they were ereéted at a more  
cotifiderable’ diftance. As the dire@ion of the lightning is,  
however, uncertain, from a variety of caufes, as alfo to what  
éxtent one building will protect another, the committee are  
of opinion, that this apparatus to the towers will be expe-  
dient.  
  
‘ It is to be remarked, that wherever iron is employéd as a  
condu@or of lightning, efpecial care muft be taken to prevent  
its becoming rufty; as, from being long expofed to the moift  
atmofphere, it will be corroded to a confiderable depth: and  
fo much of: the i iron as is cotroded céafes to be of ufe aS a con-

duétor ; the committee therefore have, in dire@ing the fize of  
thefe iron bars, made fome allowance for the waite of the iron  
by ruft.  
  
* The fize, as well as number, of the iron bars recommended  
here by the committee, are only to be confidered as applicable  
to St. Paul’s, and not as a ftandard for any church or building  
of lefs dimenfions ; as in thefe laft, conduétors of a fmaller  
fize, and fewer in number, may an({wer the purpofe as fecurely  
as the larger. But St. Paul’s church is particularly circum-  
ftanced : it is an edifice not only of great height, but its cu-  
pola, to fay nothing of the lead on the body of the church,  
prefents a large furface of metal to the clouds; on which ac-  
count it is very liable to receive greater quantities of the elec-  
tric fluid; and, from large quantities of fuch an elaftic power,  
great mifchiefs may arife to this magnificent building, in con-  
fequence of obftructions the fluid may meet with in pafling  
through it. For thefe reafons we have recommended very  
large condu@ors, that it may pafs through them into the ground,  
as readily as it enters.’
