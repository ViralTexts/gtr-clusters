Jan. 29. and Feb. 8. The preceding Copies of the same Dates never came to hand. I thank you very much for the News-Papers, tho’ the Disputes I see in them gave me Pain. You observe rightly that the want of good Conveyances obstructs much the punctuality of our Correspondence. The Number of long Letters I have written to America have almost discouraged me from writing, except by such an Opportunity as this: You may judge of the Uncertainty of Letters getting to hand, when I tell you that tho’ you mention the having sent me Quadruplicates of my Credentials, only those by the Marquis de La Fayette have yet appeared.  
I am glad to understand that you are taking Measures to restore the Value of your Money, by taxing largely to reduce the Quantity. I believe no Financier in the World can put you upon a more effectual Method.

 Congress have wisely enjoyned the Ministers in Europe to agree with one another. I had always resolved to have no quarrel, and have therefore made it a constant Rule to answer no angry, affronting or abusive Letter of which I have received Many and long Ones from Mr Lee &amp; Mr Izard, who I understand, and see indeed by the Papers, have been writing liberally, or rather ill-liberally against me, to prevent, as one of them says here, any Impressions my writing against them might occasion to their Prejudice: But I have never before mentioned them in any of my Letters.

amin Franklin has been often quoted by the  
advocates of inflation as on their side of the paper-­  
money question. It is true, indeed, that Frankiin,  
when in his twenty-third year, wrote and printed  
  
tem for the young colony of vennayivania. But  
the riper wisdom of his later years effectually  
repaired this youthful blunder, and we find him in  
the Continental Congress lending the powerful in-­  
nluence of his voice and vote against those inflated  
issues of irredeemable paper which remain unpaid  
unto this day; and in 1777, writing from Paris to  
James Lovell, Franklin used the following lan-­  
guage  
I am glad to understand that you are taking  
measures to restore the value of your money by  
taxing largely to reduce the quantity. I believe  
no financier in the world can put you upon a more  
effectual method
