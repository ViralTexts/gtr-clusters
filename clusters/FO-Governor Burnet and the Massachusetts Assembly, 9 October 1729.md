 News.  
Much deserved Praise has the deceas’d Governour received, for his steady Integrity in adhering to his Instructions, notwithstanding the great Difficulty and Opposition he met with, and the strong Temptations offer’d from time to time to induce him to give up the Point. And yet perhaps something is due to the Assembly (as the Love and Zeal of that Country for the present Establishment is too well known to suffer any Suspicion of Want of Loyalty) who continue thus resolutely to Abide by what they Think their Right, and that of the People they represent, maugre all the Arts and Menaces of a Governour fam’d for his Cunning and Politicks, back’d with Instructions from Home, and powerfully aided by the great Advantage such an Officer always has of engaging the principal Men of a Place in his Party, by conferring where he pleases so many Posts of Profit and Honour. Their happy Mother Country will perhaps observe with Pleasure, that tho’ her gallant Cocks and matchless Dogs abate their native Fire and Intrepidity when transported to a Foreign Clime (as the common Notion is) yet her Sons in the remotest Part of the Earth, and even to the third and fourth Descent, still retain that ardent Spirit of Liberty, and that undaunted Courage in the Defence of it, which has in every Age so gloriously distinguished Britons and Englishmen from all the Rest of Mankind

on to say: ‘* Much deserved praise has the de-  
ceased governor received for his steady integrity in  
adhering to his instructions, notwithstanding the  
  
great difficulty and opposition he met with, and  
the strong temptations offered from time to time  
to induce him to give up the point. And yet,  
perhaps, something is due to the Assembly -(as  
the love and zeal of that country for the present  
establishment is too well known to suffer any sus-  
picion of want of loyalty), who continue thus  
resolutely to abide by what ‘hey think tneir right  
and that of the people they represent; maugre  
all the arts and mefiaces of a governor famed  
for his cunning and politics, backed with instruc-  
tions from home, and powerfully aided by the  
great advantage such an officer always has of  
engaging the principal men of a place in his party,  
by conferring where he pleases so many posts of  
profit and honor. Their happy mother country  
will perhaps observe with pleasure, that though her  
gallant cocks and matchless dogs abate their natural  
fire and intrepidity, when transported to a foreign  
clime (as this nation is), yet her sons in the re-  
motest part of the earth, and even to the third  
and fourth descent, still retain that ardent spirit  
of liberty, and that undaunted courage which have  
in every age so gloriously distinguished Brirons  
and ENGLISHMEN from the rest of mankind.”
