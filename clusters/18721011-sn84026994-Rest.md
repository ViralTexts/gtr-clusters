And with desire have I long desired  
Rest—only Rest.

But God knows best.  
And I have prayed—but vain has been my prayer,

And so I cry a weak and human cry,  
So heart oppressed;  
And so I sigh a weak and human sigh  
For Rest—for Rest.

And cares infest  
My path, and thro&#x27; the flowing of hot tears

My feet are wearied, and my hands are

Best perfect rest.  
&quot;Tis hard to toil, when toil is almost vain,  
In barren ways;  
&#x27;Tis hard to sow, and never gather grain  
In harvest days.  
I sowed in tears, which fell like  
autumn rain;
