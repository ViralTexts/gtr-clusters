My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired—  
My soul oppressed—  
And with desire have I long desired  
Rest—only Rest.  
  
&#x27;Tis hard to toil—when toil is almost vain  
In barren ways;  
&#x27;Tis hard to sow, and never garner grain  
In harvest days.  
  
The burden of my days is hard to bear—  
But God knows best.  
And I have prayed—but vain has been my prayer,  
For Rest—sweet Rest.  
  
&#x27;Tis hard to plant in spring, and never reap  
The autumn yield;  
&#x27;Tis hard to till—and when &#x27;tis tilled to weep  
O&#x27;er fruitless field.  
  
And so I cry a weak and human cry,  
So heart oppressed;  
And so I sigh a weak and human sigh  
For Rest—for Rest.  
  
My way has wound across the desert years,  
And cares infest  
My path, and thro&#x27; the flowing of hot tears  
I pine for Rest.  
  
&#x27;Twas always so; when still a child, I laid

Rest. The following is from the &#x27;  
Collected Poems of father Abram J.  
Ryan,&#x27; and was, we believe, the 5avorite  
of the late Sir John Macdonald : My feet  
are wearied, and my hands are tired, My  
soul oppressed — And I desire, what 1  
have longed desired — Best — only rest.  
Tis hard to toil — when toil is almost  
vain, In barren ways; ?&#x27;Tis hard to sow  
— and never garner grain In harvest  
days. The burden of my days is hard to  
bear, But God knows best ; And I have  
prayed — but vain has been my prayer—  
For rest — sweet rest. &#x27;Tis hard to  
plant in Spring and never reap The  
Autumn yield ; &#x27;Tis hard to till, and  
when tilled to weep O&#x27;er fruitless  
field. And so I cry, a weak and human  
cry, So heart oppressed ; And I sigh, a  
weak and human sigh, For rest — for  
rest. Sly way has wound across the  
desert years, And cares infest My path,  
and thtough the flowing of hot tears I  
pine — for rest. &#x27;Twas always so ; when
