My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired—  
My soul oppressed—  
And with desire have I long desired  
Rest—only Rest.  
  
&#x27;Tis hard to toil—when toil is almost vain  
In barren ways;  
&#x27;Tis hard to sow, and never garner grain  
In harvest days.  
  
The burden of my days is hard to bear—  
But God knows best.  
And I have prayed—but vain has been my prayer,  
For Rest—sweet Rest.  
  
&#x27;Tis hard to plant in spring, and never reap  
The autumn yield;  
&#x27;Tis hard to till—and when &#x27;tis tilled to weep  
O&#x27;er fruitless field.  
  
And so I cry a weak and human cry,  
So heart oppressed;  
And so I sigh a weak and human sigh  
For Rest—for Rest.  
  
My way has wound across the desert years,  
And cares infest  
My path, and thro&#x27; the flowing of hot tears  
I pine for Rest.  
  
&#x27;Twas always so; when still a child, I laid  
On mother&#x27;s breast  
My wearied little head; e&#x27;en then I prayed,  
As now, for Rest  
  
And I am restless still; &#x27;twill soon be o&#x27;er;  
For, down the West,  
Life&#x27;s sun is setting, and I see the shore  
Where I shall Rest.

My feet are wearied and my hands are tired—  
My soul oppressed—  
And with desire have I long desired  
Rest—only rest.  
’Tis hard to toil—when toil is almost rain—  
In barren ways;  
’Tis hard to sow and never earner grain  
In harvest days.  
The burden of my day Is hard to bear—  
ButOod knows best;  
And I have prated, but vain haft been my prayer,  
For rest—sweet rest,  
*Tishnrd to plant in Spring and never reap  
The autumn yield ;  
’Tls hard to till—and when&#x27;tis tilled to weep  
O’er fruitless field.  
And so lory a weak and human cry,  
So heart Oppressed;  
And so I sigh a weak amt human sigh  
For rest—for test.  
My way was wound across the desert years,  
And cares Infest  
My path j and through the flowing of hot tears  
I pine for rest.  
’Tis always so ; when still a child, I laid %  
On mother&#x27;s breast  
My wearied little head ; e’en then I prayed,  
As now, for rest.  
And I am restless, still; ’twill soon bo o’ef ;  
For, down the West  
Life’s sun is setting, and 1 see the shore  
Where I shall rest.

the spring and tasted little of the autumn yield. Nothing remained for him but a  
weak and human cry of ‘heart oppresed.’ He shed ‘hot tears and pined for

great or too many for his honest convictions. De mortuis nil nist bonum.  
  
Yet I am proud and happy to think that neither you nor I gave way to ‘flesh

Their sweetest harps have broken strings,  
Their grandest accords have their jars,  
Like shadows on the light of stars,  
And somehow, something ever mars  
  
The songs the greatest minstrel sings.  
  
And so each song is incomplete,  
  
And not a rhyme can ever round  
  
Into the chords of perfect sound  
  
The tones of thought that e’er surround  
The ways walked by the poet&#x27;s feet.  
  
And now we close the account of the poet and his poetry.  
His life was not without cares and sorrow, and his lot was the  
lot of a wanderer. In 1886 this restless soul took its flight and  
sought the rest which it had so long desired.  
  
My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired,  
My soul oppressed—  
  
And I desire, what I have long desired  
Rest—only rest.

o much ait tent ion to  
&#x27;trimming up their voices in sweetness for r  
the telephone and not enough to brevity.  
It is e-it&#x27;ima.ted that an Atdiiuson woman  
walks five miles -a day in going to itlhe cor­  
ner with departing guests. She (has so  
much of it to do tinut fetie has been com­  
pelled to abandon her custom of walking to  
the front gate wihh her husband.  
Wh*en a woman comes downtown looking  
particularly worried, you can’t tell whether  
who is drcadi.&#x27;ing to go to lino dentist and  
have a tooth putted or dreaoJing the ordeal  
of baking a $4 hat when a $15 one suits her  
&#x27;better.  
  
REST  
Fa»they Ryan.  
My feet are wearied and my hands are  
tired.  
My soul oppressed—  
1 And I desire, what I have long desired—  
Rest—only rest.  
’Tis hard to toil—when toll is almost vain,  
In barren ways;  
’Tis hard to sow—and never garner grain  
^ In harvest days.  
. The burden of my days is hard to bear,  
But God knows best;  
( And 1 have prayed—but vain has been my  
. * prayer.  
For rest—sweet rest.  
■ ’Tis hard to plant In spring and never reap  
This autumn yield;  
’Tis hard to till, and when &#x27;tis tilled, to  
weep  
O’er fruitless field.  
And so I e»ry a weak and &#x27;human cry,  
&amp;o heart oppressed;  
And so I sigh a weak and human sigh,  
For rest—for rest.  
My way has wound across the desert years,  
And cares infect  
My patth, and through the flowing of hot :  
tears  
I pine tor rest.  
1 ’Twas always so: when still a child I laid  
On mother’* breast  
My wearied little bead; e’eh then I prayed  
As nowr—for rest.  
And T am restless still; will soon be o’er;  
1 For down the West  
Life’s sun is sotting, and 1 see title shore  
I • Whore 4 Bhall rust.
