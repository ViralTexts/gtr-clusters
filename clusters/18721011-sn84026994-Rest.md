My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired—  
My soul oppressed—  
And with desire have I long desired  
Rest—only Rest.  
  
&#x27;Tis hard to toil—when toil is almost vain  
In barren ways;  
&#x27;Tis hard to sow, and never garner grain  
In harvest days.  
  
The burden of my days is hard to bear—  
But God knows best.  
And I have prayed—but vain has been my prayer,  
For Rest—sweet Rest.  
  
&#x27;Tis hard to plant in spring, and never reap  
The autumn yield;  
&#x27;Tis hard to till—and when &#x27;tis tilled to weep  
O&#x27;er fruitless field.  
  
And so I cry a weak and human cry,  
So heart oppressed;  
And so I sigh a weak and human sigh  
For Rest—for Rest.  
  
My way has wound across the desert years,  
And cares infest  
My path, and thro&#x27; the flowing of hot tears  
I pine for Rest.  
  
&#x27;Twas always so; when still a child, I laid  
On mother&#x27;s breast  
My wearied little head; e&#x27;en then I prayed,  
As now, for Rest  
  
And I am restless still; &#x27;twill soon be o&#x27;er;  
For, down the West,  
Life&#x27;s sun is setting, and I see the shore  
Where I shall Rest.
