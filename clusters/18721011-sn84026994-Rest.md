And so 1 cry a weak and human cry,  
So heart oppressed;  
And so 1 sigh, a weak and human sigh.

My way has wound across the desert years,

My path; and through the Mowing of hot tears.  
I pine for Rest.  
  
’Twas always so; when still a child I laid  
On mother’s breast  
My wearied little head, e’en then 1 prayed,  
As now, for Rest.  
  
And 1 am restless still; ’twill soon be o’er.  
For down the west.  
The sun is setting and I see the shore

Clarence knew nothing of the hour

ill knew of no reason more power­  
til than Christian charity which had  
idticed his father to adopt the ponni­  
jss girl, whori she was left alono in  
ho world; and, full of fair dreams for  
is futuro, ho shrank from a marriage  
rith one whom lie had rarely scon, in  
is years of study and travel, and who  
ras to him only a shy, awkward child  
-no more.  
&quot;I have no lovo,&quot; ho answered.  
&#x27;Why do you ask this of mo, my dear  
alher? Make any provision you wish  
or Miss Monroe; dower her as riehl&#x27;  
s you choose. Hut leave her, as I  
iray you to leave me, f roe. 1 have no  
dvo for hor, nor she for me; wo aro  
Grangers. Let us remain so, lost in

&quot;Stoop down, Ciarenco. She loves

&quot;There is no other way,&quot; nioauod

Uiseal my lips, I will toll you how 1  
allied my wealth, and planted my

ly cordial! Tho story is not long, but  
cry hard to toll very hard, my bey  
-for it will make you blush for your  
kthor.&quot;  
And, while the summer night closed  
a, gray and spectral, Claronco Liv­  
agstone, listening to his father&#x27;s  
tory, of a credulous friond betrayed,  
lid wealth snatched from a too trust­  
Dg hand, bout his young hoael in a  
itimiliation wholly now and wholly  
Dtolerable to liiiu.  
Without, in tlio clustering shadows  
if tho veranda, drooping like a lily on  
ts stem, stood Lena Munroo, drinking  
o tho t&#x27;tlo, with puhos boating as  
trougly as those in tho broast of her  
&#x27;laronoe, in hor own girlish bosom  
miu as keen, rogrot as bitter; for she  
ad loved Elmar Livingstone as a so­  
und father, and felt tho sin of tho  
ying as keenly as tho wrong done  
he dead.  
Hosidcs, anothor pang was hers  
or Clarenco had bogged his fathor  
;ot to nsk him to bo more than a  
trangor to her!  
Tho story was told, and tho old  
nan lay panting on his pillows, his  
ace damp with dows of coming death;  
,nd tho girl, peering into tho chamber  
fith wide darkened eyes, saw Clar­  
nco on his knees beside the couch.  
&quot;Forgive mo my sou! I uid the  
rong for vou,&quot; camo hoarsely to her  
rom tlio drawn lips of tho dylii&quot;.  
Make her your wife, and all will bo  
eli. She Is puro as a llowor unpluck­  
cl. She has grown tlear to mo as a  
laughter nnd, my boy, sho loves  
&#x27;Oil.&quot;  
A hot flush crept into hor facoat tho  
ow, broken words, but it died in­  
tnntly, for Claronco was replying,  
n d sho bent hor, face to her hands as  
lie llstoned.  
&quot;Sho may bo all you say,&quot; camo in  
he clear tones of theyoung man; &quot;but  
lio is no moro to mo than a flower  
fhioh I havo no wish to gathor. If  
lie loves mo, it is with a childish loro,  
rhleh will not lltigor. Rest content,  
n &#x27;hor, sho shall not suffer through  
  
your your regard for mo. I wll  
giro back every ill-gotten dollar. Hut  
I will keep my freedom; I can not sell  
it, father.&quot;  
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  
&quot;That 1 will make over to Mis&#x27;?  
Munroo every acre that you leave mo  
every farthing that is lior duo. Nay,  
not ouo dissenting word?&quot; as the o&#x27;d  
man strove to speak. &quot;Let me keep  
my houosty, and mako my own way  
with clean hands, if empty ones. 1  
would not oiler my hand to your  
ward now, oven though I loved her,  
which I do not&quot; .  
&quot;Claronce, my son!,f  
&quot;Father, say no more, but trust to  
me; now you shall sleep.&quot;  
The girl, shaken by hushod sobs,  
turned from tho silvory night, and  
glided into tho house like a shadow.  
Ere morning dawned, tho soul of  
Ehnar Liviugstouo had gono, whore  
human eye could not lollow its flight,  
free of that clogging clay, to its judg­  
ment. And, as untraceable, it would seem,  
as tho spirit of tuo mail who had  
wronged her, yet guarded hor youth,  
Leiia Munroo had also gono with the  
night, leaving no token behind her,  
bidding no farewell.  
Six yoars later the accident occur­  
red on tho midnight train which tilled  
tho hospital of G with moaning  
life, orerushod and shapoless bodies,  
in which was loft scarcely strength to  
sigh.  
&#x27;Tho nursos went from pallet to pal­  
let, holding bandages, aiding to bind  
up great gaping wounds, shrinking  
from the sight of severod arms, but  
putting personal feeling away before  
tho great needs that mot them.  
Ono nurse, with sweet, blue eyos,  
tender and pitiful, gavo a low cry at  
last, as tho surgeon, whoo assistant  
sho was, paused besido a cot on which  
a young man lay unconscious.  
&quot;You know him?&quot; tlio surgeon  
asked her regarding her blanched  
faco curiously.  
She bent her head in silence, a sob  
bursting from hor lips.  
Half an hour later ho lay there un­  
der her eyes, cold and still, witli strips  
of linen across his bosom, a broken,  
bandaged arm, and court plaster hold-&#x27;  
ing together the red edges of a gash,  
that ran perilously near the temple;  
and sho knelt beside the eot with an  
ashen pain in her young face, as she  
stroked back the hair lrom his fore-&#x27;  
head.  
&quot;Aftor six years!&quot; she whispered,  
soltly. &quot;Oh, my lovo! aftor six joars,  
during which I havo striven to forgot  
your lace, to see it so cold and wh:te!  
Hut you shall be more tenderly cared  
for than though you had a sister near  
you; and when you are well onough to  
know me, wo part again.&quot;  
For tho crushed and wounded man  
was Clarence Livingstone, tlio kneel  
  
ing nurso tlio girl to whom ho had re­  
fused his dying father to mako oiler  
of his hand Lena Munrco.  
Long days and nights lollowed each  
other, and Claronco waked from stu  
por to mad delirium, in which ho told  
patient nurso all of which sho already  
know, and much besides told her ofi  
the wealth ho had vowed novor to  
touch, lying in his solicitor&#x27;s hands  
for tlio girl ho could not traco; of;  
struggles and trial which ho had gono!  
Or) O &#x27;  
through, which mado her bluo oyes;  
dim.  
Hut ho said no word of any woman  
whoso lovo was his guerdon, and sho  
was glad that wa3 sparcel her.  
Once in a midnight hour, when tho  
ward was silent and the lights low,  
about them, he suddenly put lorth his,  
uninjured hand and took ono of hers;  
his eyes, brilliant with fovor, wero  
fastened on hor face.  
&quot;My fathor loved you as a daugh­  
ter,&#x27;&#x27; ho said, softly, &quot;and ho told mo

and I wanted him to loavo

AFTJffl SIX YEAES.  
  
BY MARY C. KKKSTOX.  
  
&quot;I am giving you a treasure, my son.  
Why do you hesitate? Surely you  
have no other love?&quot;  
  
The sick man lifted himself on his  
pillow, and looked eargerly, fearfully  
in the face above him.  
  
It was a haughty, yet frank coun­  
tenance—a face which mingled strength  
of will with pride, and tenderness  
with truth, yet liad enough poetic fire  
in it to make the request his father  
made of Clarence Livingstone a very  
hard one lor him to grant.  
  
For Elniar Livingstone, dying, re­  
membered the wrongs done by him &quot;in  
the days of nature,&quot; and, recalling a  
lucky venture, which,by enriching him,  
had beggared another, asked his son  
to take that other&#x27;s orphan daughter  
for his wife.  
  
Clarence knew nothing of the hour  
of temptation which saw his father&#x27;s  
fall—knew of no reason more powerful  
than Christian charity which had in­  
duced his father to adopt the penni­  
less girl, when she was left alone in the  
world and, full of fair dreams for his  
future, he shrank from a marriage  
with one whom he had rarely seen, in  
his years of study and travel,and who  
was to him only a sliy, awkward child  
—no more.  
&quot;I have no love,&quot; he answered.  
&quot;Why do you ask this of me, my dear  
father? Make any provision you wish  
for Miss Munroe dower her as richly  
as you choose. But leave her, as I  
  
you to leave me, free. I have no  
for her, nor she for me we are  
utrangers. Let us remain so, lest in  
mating us as you would you do both  
lives injury.&quot;  
&quot;Stoop down, Clarence. She loves  
jrou you have been her hero, her idol  
tor years. I have fostered her idola­  
try for I have wished to atone for the  
wrong I did her and there is but one  
way—to make her the wife of my only  
son. My boy, you will not refuse to  
make my last hours easier?&quot;  
&quot;Father, I would purchase your  
peace with my life, were it possible.  
But there is surely some other way  
than this, and I will find it. What is  
the wrong of which you speak? I  
must know it, since I am to atone  
and trust me, my father, though it  
take my life, I will not fail to make  
the atonement a complete one.&quot;  
&quot;There is no other way,&quot; moaned  
the sick man &quot;and since you bid me  
unseal my lips, I will tell &quot;you how I  
gained my wealth, and planted my  
life with aloes of remorse, my son.  
My cordial! Thestory is not long, but  
very hard to tell—very hard my boy  
—for it will make \oublush for your  
father.&quot;  
  
And, while the summer night closed  
in, gray and spectral, Clarence Living­  
stone, listening to bis father&#x27;s story,  
of a credulous friend betrayed, and  
wealth snatched from a too trusting  
hand, bent his young head in a humil­  
iation wholly new and whclly intoler­  
able to him.  
  
Without, in the clustering shadows  
of the veranda, drooping like a lily on  
its stem, stood Lena Munroe, drink­  
ing in the tale, with pulses beating as  
strongly as those in the breast of her  
Clarence, in her own girlish bosom  
pain as keen, regret as bitter for she  
had loved Elmar Livingstone as a  
second father, and felt the sin of the  
dying as keenly as the wrong done the  
dead.  
  
Besides, another pang was hers—for  
Clarence liad begged his father not to  
ask him to be more than a stranger to  
her!  
  
The story was told, and the old man  
lay panting on his pillows, his face  
damp with dews of coming death and  
the girl, peering into the chamber with  
wide, pain darkened eyes, saw Clarence  
on his knees beside the couch.  
&quot;Forgive, me, my son! I did the  
wrong for you,&quot; came hoarsely to her  
from the drawn litis of the dying.  
&quot;Make her your wife, and all will be  
well. She is pure as a flower un­  
plucked. She has grown dear to me  
as a daughter—and, my boy, she loves  
you.&quot;  
  
1  
  
A hot flush crept into her face at  
the low, broken words, but it died in­  
stantly, for Clarence was replying, and  
she bent her face to her hands as she  
listened.  
&quot;She may be all you say,&quot; came in  
the clear tones of the young man but  
she is no more to me than a flower  
which I have no wish to gather. If  
she loves me, it is with a childish love,  
which will not linger. Rest content,  
father, she shall not suffer through  
your-^our regard for me. I will give  
back every ill-gotten dollar. But I  
will keep my freedom I can not sell  
it, father.&quot;  
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  
&quot;That I will make over to Miss  
Munroe every acre that you leave me  
—every farthing thr.t is her due. Nay,  
notone dissenting word.&quot; as the old  
man strove to speak. &quot;Let me keep  
my honesty, and make my own way  
with clean hands, if empty ones. I  
would not offer my hand to your  
ward now, even though I loved her,  
which I do not.&quot;  
&quot;Clarence, my son!&quot;  
  
&quot;Ftttner, -jo more, but trust to  
me now you shall sleep.&quot;  
The girl, shaken by hushed sobs,  
turned from the silvery night:, and  
glided into the house like a. shadow.  
  
Ere morning dawned, the soul of  
Elniar Livingstone had gone, where  
human eye could not follow its flight,  
free of the clogging clay, to its judg­  
ment.  
  
And, as untraceable, it would seem,  
as the spirit of the man who had  
wronged her, yet guarded her youth,  
Lena, Munroe had also gone with the  
night, leaving no token behind her,  
bidding no farewell.  
  
Six years later the accident occur­  
red on the midnight train which filled  
the hospital of (i tvithmoaninglife,  
or crushed and shapeless bodies, in  
which was left scarcely strength to  
sigh.  
  
The nurses went from pallet to pal­  
let, holding bandages, aiding to bind  
u|i great gaping wounds, shrinking  
from the sight of severed arms, but  
putting personal feeling away before  
tlii-great needs that met tlieni.  
  
One nurse, with sweet, blue eyes,  
tender ami pitiful, gave a low cry at  
last, as the surgeon, whose assistant  
she was, paused beside a cot on which  
a young man lay unconscious.  
&quot;You know him?&quot; the.surgeon asked  
her, regarding her blanched face curi­  
ously.  
  
She bent her head in silence, a sob  
bursting from her lips.  
llalf an hour later he lay thereun­  
der her eyes, cold and still, wit list rips  
of linen across his bosom, a broken,  
bandaged arm, and court plaster hold­  
ing together tho red edges of a gash  
that ran perilously near the temple  
and she knelt beside the cot with an  
ashen pain in her young face, as she  
stroked back the hair from his fore­  
head.  
&quot;After six years!&quot; she whispered  
softly. &quot;Oh, my loye! after six years,  
during which time 1 have striven to  
forget your face, to see it so cold and  
white! But you shall be more tender­  
ly cared for than though you had a  
sister near you and when you are well  
enough to know me, we part again.&quot;  
  
For the crushed and wounded man  
was Clarence Livingstone, the kneeling  
nurse the girl to whom he had refused  
his dying father to make offer of his  
hand—Lena Munroe.  
  
Long days and nights followed each  
other, and Clarence waked from stu­  
por to mad delirium, in which he told  
his patient nurse all of which she al­  
ready knew, and much besides—told  
her of the wealth he had vowed never  
to touch, lying in his solicitor&#x27;s hands  
for thegirl he could not trace of strug­  
gle and trial which he hadgone through  
which made her blue eyes dim.  
  
But he said no word of any woman  
whose love was his guerdon, and she  
was glad that was spared her.  
  
Once in a midnight hour, when the  
ward was silent and the lights low  
about them, he suddenly put forth  
his uninjured hand and took one of  
hers his eyes, brilliant with fever,  
were fastened on her face.  
&quot;My father loved you as a daugh­  
ter,&quot; hesaidsoftly, &quot;and he told me  
you loved me: but I did not believe,  
and I wanted him to leave me free.  
Child, why did you fly from me? Did  
you fear I would learn to love you?&quot;  
  
She bent her face, and tears flowed  
silently down her cheeks.  
It was deliruim, she knew but she,  
who had been unable to forget, re­  
membering that long hour in the ear­  
ly night too vividly not to again feel  
some ox its pain as she heard him.  
  
It was weeks later when, after a  
long sleep, he wakened to full con­  
sciousness one morning at day-dawn.  
  
The lights were low, the scene spec­  
tral, as his languid eyes turned from  
object to object.  
  
At last they rested on the quiet fig­  
ure of his nurse, asleep in her chair,  
and there they lingered.  
  
How sweet and girlish the weary  
face was, under the stiff cap!—and sad,  
too, as though this life was not such  
as her heart yearned for. And the  
hands lying idly in her lap were so  
fair  
and white and slender, dainty enough  
to be decked with gems, fair enough to  
be kissed, but too frail and white for  
tearing of linen and lifting of dying  
heads, he told himself.  
  
Then a sort of memory came to him  
of those Soft fingers on his brow, when  
it had seemed burning ot that sweet  
face bent over him in his delirium,  
when he had taken it for the face of  
an angel.  
  
He had seen it before, but where?  
Perhaps in one of his day dreams.  
Now he would never forget, hetold him­  
self, as, his own eyes closing, hedropped  
off to sleep.  
  
It was mid-day when he waked again  
and found her bending over him, and  
this time he recognized her.  
&quot;Lena!&quot; he cried, trying to put out  
his hand.  
  
But he was too weak. It fell on the  
counter] jane.  
&quot;You know me?&quot; she said softly,  
turning paler.  
&quot;I know you. and I want to tell you,&quot;  
he whispered, faintly, out with a warm  
glow in his eyes—&quot;you are an heiress  
there is no need for you to do this work.  
My father—&quot;  
&quot;I know it all,&quot; she broke in &quot;and  
that was why I left Lynn as I did.  
Did you think I would beggar you?  
And your father had been kind tome.  
I forgave him because he loved me. I  
will not go back I will not take a  
farthing of that money it is yours.&quot;  
&quot;Then share it with me,&quot; he said  
softly. &quot;I would not ask you once,  
because I did not love you. I do now,  
because love has grown in my heart  
for you in an hour. Lena, you have  
nursed me back to life from what must  
have been very nearly death. Will  
you learn to care enough for me to  
share my future?&quot;  
&quot;You love me!&quot; she said incredu­  
lously. &quot;When did vou learn the les­  
son?&quot;  
&quot;At day dawn, while I watched you  
asleep in your chair, ere I knew who  
you were. Lena, do not doubt me!&quot;  
&quot;I do not.&quot; She knelt at thecotand  
put back his hair, as he had dreamed  
she did while he was unconscious.  
&quot;And I will own to you, Clarence,that  
I have loved you always since I first  
saw you. That was why I fled from  
Lynn.&quot;  
&quot;And now you will come back?&quot;  
&quot;For the same reason,&quot; she smiled,  
although her lips were tremulous.  
&quot;Love sent me forth then love recalls  
me now, and I will share the posses­  
sions with you which were neither  
honestly yours nor mine, but can be­  
long fairly to us together. Yes, Clar­  
ence, I will go back!&quot;  
  
Miss Jennie Buckley, daughter of a  
keeper of the Concord prison, Massa­  
chusetts, having fallan desperately in  
love with one Mead, a burglar convict,  
whose eight year&#x27;s term expired a  
few days ago, has married him. A  
Lynn despatch says the wedding took  
place before &quot;a brilliant assemblage.&quot;

lie was the greenest old man you  
ever saw. He looked around the pas­  
senger coach in away to prove that  
lie had never entered one before, and  
he sat down so softly, and seemed to  
be so afraid of damaging something,  
that all the passengers smiled.  
  
By and by a young man went over  
antl sat down beside him. This young  
man might have been directed by filial  
affection, and he might not. &quot;Which  
way, uncle?&quot; he softly asked.

&quot;This is the first time I was ever on

with the oxen to see my other darter,

its stem, stood Lena Munroe, drink­  
ing in the tale, with pulses beating as  
strongly as those in the breast of her  
Clarence, in her own girlish bosom  
pain as keen, regret as bitter for she  
had loved Elmar Livingstone as a  
second father, and felt the sin of the  
dying as keenly as the wrong done the  
dead.  
  
Besides, another pang was hers—for  
Clarence had begged his father not to  
ask him to be more than a stranger to  
her!  
  
The story was told, and the old man  
lay panting on his pillows, his face  
d&#x27;amp with dews of coming death and  
the girl, peering into the chamber with  
wide, pain darkened eyes, saw Clarence  
on hia knees beside the couch.  
&quot;Forgive, me, my son! I did the  
wrong for you,&quot; came hoarsely to her  
from the draw# lips of the.dying.  
&quot;Slake her your wife, and all will be  
well. She fs pure as a flower un­  
packed. She has grown dear to me  
as a daughter—and, my boy, she loves  
you.&quot;  
  
A hot flush crept into her face at  
the low, broken words, but it died in­  
stantly, for Clarence was replying, and  
she bent her face to her hands as she  
listened.  
&quot;She may be all you say,&quot; carne in  
the clear tones of the young man but  
she is 110 more to me than a flower  
which I have no wish t-o gather. If  
she lo.ves me, it is with a childish love,  
which will not linger. Rest content,  
father, she shall not suffer through  
your—your regard for me. I will give  
back every ill-gotten dollar. But I  
will keep my freedom I can not sell  
it, father.*&#x27;  
&quot;What do jrou mean?&quot;  
&quot;That I will make over to Miss  
Munroe every acre that you leave me  
—every farthing that is ner due. J^ay,  
not one dissenting word,&quot; as the old  
man strove to speak. &quot;Let me keep  
my honesty, ana make my own way  
with clean bands, if empty ones. I  
would not offer my hand to your  
ward now, even ^though I loved her,  
which I do not.&quot;  
&quot;Clarence, my son!&quot;  
  
&quot;Fatner,  
  
.JO  
  
more, but trust to  
  
me now you shall sleep.&quot;  
The girl, shaken by- hushed&#x27; sobs,  
turned from the silvery night, and  
glided into the house like a shadow.*  
  
Ere morning dawned, the soul of  
Elmar Livingstone had gone, where  
human eye could not follow its flight,  
free of the clogging clay, to its judg­  
ment.  
  
And, as untraceable, it would seem,  
as the spirit of the man who had  
wronged her, yet guarded her youth,  
Lena Munroe had also gone with the  
night, leaving no token behind her,  
bidding no farewell.  
  
Six years later the accident occur­  
red on the midnight train which filled  
the hospital of G—with moaning life,  
or crushed and shapeless bodies, in  
which was left scarcely strength to  
sigh.  
  
The nurses went from pallet to pal­  
let, holding bandages, aiding to bind  
up great gaping wounds, shrinking  
from the sight of severed arms, but  
putting personal feeling away before  
the great needs that met them.  
  
One nurse, with sweet, blue eyes,  
tender and pitiful, gave a low cry at  
last, as the surgeon, whose assistant  
she was, paused besirle a cot 011 which  
a young man lay unconscious.  
&quot;You know him?&quot; the surgeon asked  
her, regarding her blanched face curi­  
ously.  
  
She bent her head in silence, a sob  
bursting from her lips.  
Half an hour later he lay there un­  
der her eyes, cold and still, with strips  
of linen across his bosom, a broken,  
bandaged arm, and court plaster hold­  
ing together the red edges of a gash  
that ran perilously near the temple  
and she knelt beside the cot with an  
ashen pain in her young face, as she  
stroked back the hair from his fore­  
head.  
&quot;After six years!&quot; sne whispered  
softly. &quot;Oh, my loye! after six years,  
during which time I have striven to  
forget your face, to see it so cold and  
white! But you shall be more tender­  
ly cared for than though you had a  
sister near you and when you are well  
enough to know me, we part again.&quot;  
  
For the crushed and wounded man  
was Clarence Livingstone, the. kneeling  
nurse the girl to whom he had refused  
his dying fat her to make offer of his  
hand—Lena Munroe.  
  
Long days and nights followed each  
other, and Clarence waked from stu­  
por to mad delirium, in which he told  
his patient nurse all of which she al­  
ready knew, and much besides—told  
her of the wealth he had vowed never  
to touch, lying in his solicitor&#x27;s hands  
for tliegirl he could not trace of strug­  
gle and trial which he had gone through  
which made her blue eyes dim.  
  
But he said no word of any woman  
whose love was his guerdon, and she  
was glad that was spared her.  
  
Once in a midnight hour, when the  
ward wns silent and the lights low  
about them, he suddenly put forth  
his uninjured hand and took one of  
hers his eyes, brilliant with fever,  
were fastened 011 her face.  
&quot;My father loved you as a daugh­  
ter,&quot; he  
said softly, &quot;and he told me  
you loved me but I did not believe,  
and I wanted him to leave me free.  
Child, why did you fly from me? Did  
you fear I would learn to love you?&quot;  
  
She bent her face, and tears flowed  
silently down her cheeks.  
It was delirium, she knew: but she,  
who had been unable to forget, re­  
membering that long hour in the ear­  
ly night too vividly not to again feel  
some of its pain as she heard him.  
  
It was weeks later when, after a  
long sleep, he wakvned to full con­  
sciousness one morning at day-dawn.  
  
The lights were low, the scene spec­  
tral, as his languid eyes turned from  
object to object.  
  
At last they rested on the quiet fig­  
ure of his nurse, asleep in her chair,  
and there they lingered.  
  
How sweet and girlish the weary  
face was, under the stiff cap!—and sad,  
too, as though this life was not such  
as her heart yearned for. And the  
hands lying idly in her lap were so fair  
and white and slender, dainty enough  
  
a._  
  
tearing of linen and lifting of dyiir  
heads, he told himself.  
Tlion a sort of memory came to him  
of those soft fingers on his brow, when  
it had seemed burning of that sweet  
face bent over him in his delirium,  
when he had taken it for the iace of  
an angel.  
  
He had seen it- before, but where?  
Perhaps^-in one of his day dreams.  
Now he would never forget, hetold him­  
self, as. his own eyes closing, hedropped  
off to sleep.  
  
It was mid-day when he waked again  
and found her bending over him, and  
this time he x-ecognized her.  
&quot;Lena!&quot; he cried, tr}ring to put out  
his hand.

“I am giving you a treasure, my son.  
Why do you hesitate? Surely you  
have no other love?&quot;  
  
The sick man lifted himself on his  
pillow, and looked eargerly, fearfully  
in the face above him.  
  
It was a haughty, yet frank coun­  
tenance—a face which mingled strength  
of will with pride, and tenderness  
with truth, yet had enough poetic fire  
in it to make the request his father  
made of Clarence Livingstone a very  
hard one tor him to grant.  
For Elmar Livingstone, dying, re­  
membered the wrongs done by him “in  
the days of nature,” and, recalling a  
lucky venture, which,by enriching him,  
had beggared another, asked his son  
to take that other’s orphan daughter  
for his wife.  
  
Clarence knew nothing of the hour  
of temptation which saw his father’s  
fall—knew of no reason more powerful  
than Christian charity which had in­  
duced his father to adopt the penni­  
less girl, when she was left alone in the  
world; and, full of fair dreams for his  
future, he shrank from a marriage  
with one whom he had rarely seen, in  
his years of study and travel,and who  
was to him only a shy, awkward child  
—no more.  
  
“I have no love,” he answered.  
&quot;Whydo you ask this of me, my dear  
father? Make any provision you wish  
for Miss Munroe; (lower her as richly  
as you choose. But leave her, as I  
pray vou to leave me, free. I have no  
love for her, nor she for me; we are  
strangers. Let us remain so, lest in  
mating us as you would you do both  
lives injury.”  
&quot;Stoop down, Clarence. She loves  
you; you have been her hero, her idol  
for rears. I have fostered her idola­  
try for I have wished to atone for the  
wrong I did her; and there is but one  
way—to make her the wife of my only  
son. My boy, you will not refuse to  
my last hours easier?”  
rather, I would purchase your  
peace with my.life, were it possible,  
out there is surely some other way  
than this, and I will find it. What is  
the wrong of which you speak? I  
“ust know it, since I am to atone;  
and trust me, my father, though it  
tase my life, I will not fail to make  
,® atonement a complete one.”  
there is no other way,” moaned  
e sick man; “and since you bid me  
my lips, 1 will tell you how I

tral, as his languid eyes turned from  
object to object.  
  
At last they rested on the quiot fig­  
ure of his nurse, asleep in her chair,  
and there they lingered.  
  
How sweet and girlish the weary  
:e was,, rtnder thestiffcap!—and sad,  
too, as though this life was not such  
as her heart yearned for. And the  
hands lying idly in her lap were sof-air  
and white and slender, dainty enough  
to bedecked with gems, fairenough to  
be kissed, but too frail and white for  
tearing of linen and lifting of dying  
heads, he told himself.  
  
Theft a sort of memory came tohim  
of thoso soft fingers on his brow,.when  
it had seemed burning of that sweet  
face bent over him in his delirium,  
when ho had taken it for the face of  
an angel.  
  
He had seen it- before, but where?  
Perhaps in on® of his day dreams.  
Now he would never forget, he-told him­  
self, as. his own eyes closing, he  
dropped  
off to sleep.  
  
It was mid-day when he waked again  
and found bor bendins over him, and  
this time horecognized her.  
  
Lena!&quot; he cried, trying toiiutout  
his hand.  
But he was too weak. It fell on the  
counterpane.  
  
You Know me?&quot; she said softly,  
turning paler.  
&quot;I know you, and I want to tell you,&quot;  
he whispered, faintly, out with a warm  
glow in liis eyes—&quot;you are an heiress  
there is no need for you to do this work.  
My father—&quot;  
1 know it all,&quot; she broke in &quot;and  
that was why I left Lynn as I did.  
Did you think I would beggar you?  
And your father had been kind tome.  
I forgave him because he loved me. I  
will not go back I will not take a  
farthing of that money it is yours.&quot;  
  
Then share it with me,&quot; he said  
softly. &quot;I would not ask you once,  
because I did not loveyou. I do now,  
because love has grown in my heart  
for you in an hour. Lena, you have  
nursed me back to life from what must  
have boen very nearly death. Will  
you learn to care enough for me to  
share my future?&quot;  
  
You love me!&quot;8he said incredu­  
lously. &quot;When did you learn the les­  
son?&quot;  
  
At day dawn, while I watched you  
asleep in your chair, ere I knew who  
you were. Lena, do not doubt me!&quot;  
  
I do not.&quot; She knelt at thecotand  
put back his hair, as he had dreamed  
she did while he was unconscious.  
&quot;And I will own to you, Clarence,that  
I have loved you alwavs since I first  
saw you. That was why I fled from  
Lynn.  
&quot;And now you will come back?&quot;  
&quot;For tKe same reason,&quot; she smiled,  
although her lips were tremulous.  
&quot;Love sent mc forth then love recalls  
me now, and I will shave the posses­  
sions with you which were neither  
honcstly.yours nor mine, but can be­

&quot;I am giving you a treasure, my eon.  
Why do you hesitate? Surely you have  
no other lover-  
The sick man lifted himself on hia pit  
a a an n m m mm - .  
tow ana jooxea eagerly, ieawuiiy, in  
the face above him.  
- .It waa a haughty yet fraak oounte  
nance a face which mingled strength  
of will with pride, and tenderness with  
truth, yet had enough poetic fire in it to  
maxe tne request sua lather made of  
Clarence Livingstone a very hard ona  
tor sin to grant.  
r or tunir xdvuigstione, dying, re­  
membered the wrongs dona by him &quot;in  
the days of nature,&quot; and, recalling a  
lucky venture, which by enriching him  
had beggared another, asked his son to  
taxe that other a orphan daughter for  
his wife.  
Clarence knew nothing of the hour of  
MHuputuuii wnicu saw nis xauier a rail-  
xnew oi no reason more powerful than  
Christian charity which had induced his  
father to adopt the penniless girl when  
she waa left alone in the world; and,  
full of fair dreams for his future, he  
shrank from a marriage with one whom  
he had rarely seen, in his years of study  
and travel, and who waa in him only a  
shy, awkward child no more.  
&quot;I have no love,&quot; he answered.  
Why do you aak this of me, dear  
father? Make any provisions you wish  
for Miss Munroe; dower her as richly as  
you choose; but leave her, as I pray you  
to leave me free. I have no love for  
her, nor she for me; we are strangers.  
Let us remain so, lest in mating us as  
you would, you do both lives injury.&quot;  
&quot;Stoop down, Clarence. She loves  
you, you have been her hero, her idol,  
for years. I have fostered her idolatry,  
for I have wished to atone for the wrong  
I did her; and there is but one way to  
make her tho wife of my only son. My  
boy, you will not refuse to make my last  
hour easier?&quot;  
&quot;Father, I would purchase your peace  
with my life, were it possible. But there  
is surely some other way than this, and  
I will find it. What is the wrong of  
which you speak? I must know it,  
since I am to atone; and trust me, my  
father, though it take my life, I will not  
fail to make the atonement a complete  
one.&quot;  
&quot;There is no other way,&quot; moaned the  
sick man; &quot;and since you bid me unreal  
my lips, I will tell you how I gained my  
wealth, and planted my life with aloes  
of remorse, my son. My cordial! The  
story ia not long, but very hard to tell  
very hard, my boy for it will make you  
blush for your father.&quot;  
And, while the summer night closed  
in grey and spectral Clarence Living­  
atone, listening to bis father&#x27;s story, of a  
credulous friend betrayed, and wealth  
snatched from a too-trusting hand, bent  
hia young head in a humiliation wholly  
new and wholly intolerable to him.  
Without, in the clustering shadows of  
the verandah, drooping like a lily on on  
its stem, stood Lena Munroe, drinking  
in the tale, with, pulses beating as  
strongly as those in the breast of her  
Clarence, in her own girlish bosom pain  
as keen, regret as bitter; for she had  
loved Elmar Livingston as a second  
father, and felt the sin of the dying as  
keenly as the wrong done the dead.  
Besides, another pang was hers  
for Clarence had begged his father not  
to ask him to be more than a stranger  
to her!  
- The story was told, and the old man  
lay panting on his pillows, hia face  
damp with dews of coming death; and  
the girL peering into the chamber with  
wide pain-darkened eyes, saw Clarence  
on his knees beside the couch.  
&quot;Forgive me, my son; I did the  
wrong for you,&quot; came hoarsely to her  
from the drawn lips of the dying.  
&quot;Make her your wife, and all will be  
well She has grown dear to me as a  
daughter: and, my boy, she loves you!&quot;  
A hot flush crept into her face at the  
low broken words, but it died instantly,  
for Clarence waa replying, and she bent  
her face to her hands as she listened.  
&quot;She may be all you say,&quot; came in  
the clear tones of the young man; &quot;but  
he is no more to me than a flower  
which I have no wish to gather. If she  
loves me it is with a childish love, which  
will not linger. Rest content, father,  
she shall not suffer through your your  
regard for me. I will give back all the  
ill-gotten wealth. But I will keep my  
freedom; I cannot sell it, father.&quot;  
: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;  
&quot;That I will make over to Miss Mun­  
roe every acre that you leave me every  
farthing that is due her. Nay, not one  
dissenting word,&quot; a the old man strove  
to speak. &quot;Let me keep my honesty,  
and make my own way with clean  
hands, if empty ones. I would not offer  
my hand to your ward now, even though  
I loved her, which I do not.&quot;  
&quot;Clarence, my son!&quot;  
&quot;Father, say no more, but trust to  
me; now you shall sleep.&quot;  
The girl, shaken by hushed sobs,  
turned from the silvery night, and  
glided into the house like a shadow.  
Ere morning dawned, the soul of El­  
mar Livingston had gone where human  
eye could not follow its flight, free of the  
clogging clay, to its judgment.  
And. sa untraceable, it would seem.  
as the snirit of the man who had  
wronged her. vet sruarded her youth.  
Lena Munroe had also gone with the  
night, leaving no token behind her, bid­  
ding no farewell.  
Six years later the accident occurred  
on the midnight train which filled the  
hospital of G with moaning life, or  
crashed and shapeless bodies, in which  
was left scarcely strengtn io sign.  
The nurses went from pauei to pauet.

great gaping wounoa, saruuuiig, uum  
tie sight of severed arms, but putting  
personal feeling away before the great  
needs that met them.  
One nurse, with sweet Dine eyes, verni­  
er and pitiful, gave a low cry at last, aa  
the surgeon whose assistant ahe was  
paused beside a cot on wmcn a young  
man lay unoonacwuo.

her, regarding her blanched face cu-

Vrmr tha rmahea ana wounueu uuui  
was Clarence Livingston, the kneeling  
nurse the girl to whom he &#x27; had refused  
his dvinsr father to make offer of his  
hand Lena Munroe.  
, - Long days and nighta followed each  
other, and Clarence waked up from ;  
stupor to mad delirium, in which he  
told hia patient nurse all of which ahe j  
already knew, and much besides told  
her of the wealth he had vowed never  
to touch, lying in his solicitor&#x27;s hands  
for the gm he could not trace; of struggle  
and trial which he had gone through,  
which made her blue eyes dim.  
But he said no word of any woman  
whose love was hia guerdon, and ahe  
was glad that waa spared her.  
Once, in a midnight hour, when the  
ward waa silent and the lights low about  
them, he suddenly put forth hia unin­  
jured hand and took one of hers, hia  
eyes brilliant with fever, were fastened  
on her face.  
&#x27; &quot;My father loved yon as a daughter,&quot;  
he said softly, &quot;and told me you loved  
me; but I did not believe, and I wanted  
him to leave me free. Child, why did  
vou flv from me? Did vou fear I would  
I learn to love you?&quot;

who had been unable to forget. Tsmem-

It waa weeks later when, after a long

one morning at day-dawn.

tral. aa his languid eyes turned from  
object to object.  
-At last they rested on tha quiet figure  
of .hia nurse, asleep in her chair, and  
there they lingered.  
How sweet and girlish the weary face  
was. under the stiff can! and aad. too.  
aa though this life was not such aa her  
nearx yearned for. And the hands ly.  
ing idly in her lan were, aa fair and  
white and slender, dainty enough to ba

Then a sort of memnrv cum to htm

1 did her: and there is but one way to  
make her the wife of my only son. &#x27; My

hour easier&#x27;.&#x27;&quot;  
rather, I would purchase your peace  
with my life, were it possible.&quot; But there

very hard, my boy for if will make you

in grey and sH-ctral (. larenee Living­  
ilone. listening to his father&#x27;s story, of a  
credulous friend betrayed, and wealth  
snatched from a too-trusting hand, bent  
Ilia young Lead in a humiliation wholly  
new and whoilv intolerable- to him.

its stein, -stood Lena Aluuroe. drinking  
in the tale, with pul-es heating as  
strongly as tho-e in the breast of her  
Clarence, in her own girlish bosom pain  
as keen, regret as bitter: for she had  
loved Klniar Livingston as a second  
father, and felt the &quot;sin of the dying as  
keenly as the wrong done the dead.  
Besides, anolher pang wa3 hers  
for Clarence had begged his father not  
to ask him to be more than a stranger  
to her!  
The story was told, and the old man  
lay panting on his pillow3, his face  
damp with dews of coming death; and  
the girl, peering into the chamber with  
wide pain-darkened eyes, saw Clarence  
on his knees beside the couch.  
&quot;Forgive me, my son; I did the  
wrong for you.&quot; came hoarsely to hev  
from the &quot;drawn lip.i of the dying.  
&quot;Make her your wife, and all will be  
well. She has grown dear to me as a  
daughter; and, my boy, she loves you!&quot;  
A hot flush crept into her face tit the  
low broken words, but it died instantly ,  
for (&#x27;larenee was replying, and she bent  
her face to her hands as she listened.  
&quot;She may be all you say.&quot; came in  
the clear tones of the young man; &quot;but

—Charles Follen Adams, in Boston f;lob&lt;&gt;.  
  
by rove recalled.  
“I am giving you ;i treasure, my son.  
Why do you hesitate? Surely you have  
no other love?”  
The sick man lifted himself on his pil­  
low and looked eagerly, fearfully, in  
the face above him.  
It was a haughty yet frank counte­  
nance—a face which mingled strength  
of will with pride, and tenderness with  
truth, yet had enough poetic lire in it to  
make the request his father made of  
Clarence Livingstone a very hard one  
for hint to grant.  
For Elmar Livingstone, dying, re­  
membered the wrongs done by&#x27; him “in  
the days of nature,” and, recalling a  
lucky venture, which by enriching him  
had beggared another, asked his son to  
take that other’s orphan daughter for  
his wife.  
Clarence knew nothing of the hour of  
temptation which saw his father’s fall—  
knew of no reason more powerful than  
Christian charity which had induced his  
father to adopt the penniless girl when  
she was left alone in the world; and,  
full of fair dreams for his future, ho  
shrank from a marriage with one whom  
he had rarely seen, in his years of study  
and travel, and who was in him only a  
shy, awkward child—no more.  
“I have no love,” lie answered.  
“Why do you ask this of me, dear  
father? Make any provisions you wish  
for Miss Munroe; dower her as richly as  
you choose; blit leave her, as I pray you  
to leave me—free. I have no love for  
her, nor she for me; we are strangers.  
Let us remain so, lest in mating us as  
you would, you do both lives injury.”  
“Stoop (town, Clarence. She loves  
you, you have been her hero, her idol,  
for years. I have fostered her idolatry,  
for 1 have wished to atone for the wrong  
I did her; and there is but one way—to  
make her the wife of my only son.&#x27; My  
boy, you will not refuse to make my last

“Father, I would purchase your peaco

is surely some other way than this, and

wealth, and planted my life with aloes

story is not long, but very hard to tell—  
very hard, my hoy—for it will make you  
blush for your father.”  
And, while the summer night closed  
in grey and spectral—Clarence Living­  
stone, listening to his father’s story, of a  
credulous friend betrayed, and wealth  
snatched from a too-trusting hand, bent  
his young head in a humiliation wholly  
new and wholly intolerable to him.  
Without, in the clustering shadows of  
the verandah, drooping like a lily on on  
its stem, stood Lena Munroe, drinking  
in the tale, with pulses beating as  
strongly as those in the breast of her  
Clarence, in her own girlish bosom pain  
as keen, regret as bitter; for she had  
loved Elmar Livingston as a second  
father, and felt the sin of the dying as  
keenly as the wrong done the dead.  
Besides, another pang Was hers—  
for Clarenco had begged his father not  
to ask him to he more than a stranger

The story was told, and the old man  
lay panting on his pillows, his face

the girl, peering into the chamber with  
wide pain-darkened eyes, saw Clarence

from the drawn lips of the dying.  
“Make her your wife, and all will be

A hot flush crept info her face at the  
low broken words, but it died instantly,

to speak. “Let me keep my honesty,  
and make my own way with clean  
hands, if empty ones. I would not offer  
my hand to your ward now, even though  
I loved her, which I do not.”  
“Clarence, my son!”  
“Father, say no more, but trust to  
me; now you shall sleep.”  
The girl, shaken by hushed sobs,  
turned from the silvery night, and  
glided iuto the house like a shadow.  
Ere morning dawned, the soul of El­  
mar Livingston had gone where human  
eve could not follow its flight, free of the  
clogging clay, to its judgment.  
And, as untraceable, it would seem,

REST.  
My feet are wearied and my hands are tired-  
Mty soul oppressed;  
And with desire have I long desired  
Rest--only Rest.  
Tis hard to toll when toll is almost vain,  
In barren ways  
Tis hard to sow and never garner grain  
In harvest days.  
The burden of my days is hard to bear,  
But God knows best  
And I have prayed--but vain has been my  
prayer  
For Rest, sweet Rest  
Tis hard to plant in spring and never reap  
The autumn yield;  
Tis hard to till, and when &#x27;tis tilled to weep  
O&#x27;er fruitless field.  
And so I cry-a weak and human ory  
So heart oppressed;  
And so I sigh--a weak and human sigh-  
For Rest--for Rest  
My way has wound soross the desert years:  
And cares infest  
My path, and through the flowing of hot tears  
I pine for Rest.  
&#x27;Twas always so; when still a child I laid  
On mother&#x27;s breast  
My weary little head--e&#x27;en then I prayed,  
As now, for Rest.  
And I am restless still; &#x27;t will soon be o&#x27;er,  
For down the West  
Life&#x27;s sun is setting; and I see the shore  
Where I shall Rest.

pain darkened eyes, saw Clarence on his  
kuees beside the couch.  
“Forgive me, my son! Idid the  
wrong for you,” came hoarsely to her  
f om the drawn lips of the dying. ‘*Make  
her your wife, and all will be well. She  
is pure as a flower unplucked. She has  
grown dear to&#x27;me as a daughter—and,  
my boy, she loves you.”  
A hot flush crept into her face at the  
low, broken words, bat it died instantly,  
for Clarence was replyingand she bent  
her fact to her hands as she listened.  
*‘She may be all you say, came in the  
clear tones of the young man; but she is  
no more to me than a flower that I have  
no wish to gather. If sheloves me it is  
with a childish love which will not ling­

suffer through your—regard for me. I  
will give back every lill-gotten dollar.  
But I will keep my freedom; I cannot  
sell it, father.”  
““What do you mean ?”  
“*That I will make over to Miss Mun­  
roe every acre that vou leave me—every  
farthing that is her due. Nay, not one  
dissenting word,” as the old man strove  
to’speak. Let me keep myhonesty, and  
make my own way with clean hands, if  
empty ones. I would notoffer my hand  
to your ward now, even though 1 loved  
her, which I do not.”  
  
‘“Clarence, my son !  
“Father, say no more, but trust to me;  
now you shall sleep.”  
The girl, shaken by hushed sobs,  
turned from the silvery night, and glided  
into the house like a shadow.  
Ere morning dawned the soul of El­  
mar Livingstone had gone where human  
eye could not follow its flight, free of  
the clogging clay, to its judgment.  
And, as untraceable it would seem, as  
the spirit of the man who had wronged  
her, yet unguarded her youth, Lena  
Monroe had also gone with the night,  
leaving no token behind her, bidding  
no farewell.  
  
Six years later the accident occurred  
on the midnight train, which filled the  
hospital of G—— with moaning life, or  
crushed and shapeless bodies in which  
was left scarcely strength to sigh.  
The nurses went trQm pallet to pallet,  
holding bandages, aiding to bind up  
great, gaping wounds, sTn&#x27;inking from  
the sight ot severed arms, but putting  
personal feeling away before the great  
needs that met them.  
One nurse with sweet blue eyes, ten­  
der and pitiful, gave a low cry at last,  
as the surgeon, whose assistant she was,  
paused beside a cot on which a young  
man lay unconscious.  
*“You know him ?” the surgeon asked  
her, regarding her blanched face curi­  
ously.  
She bent her head in silence, a sob  
bursting from her lips.  
Half an hour later he lay there under  
her eyes, cold and still, with strips of  
linen across his bosom, a broken, ban­  
‘daged arm, and court plaster holding to­  
‘gether the red edges of a gash that ran  
perilously near the temple; and she  
knelt beside the cot_ with an ashen pallor  
in her young face, as she stroked back  
the hair from his forehead.  
‘“‘After six years,” she whispered,  
softly. ¢Oh, my love ! after six years,  
during which I have striven to forget  
ly;our face, to see it so vold and white!  
ut you shall be more tenderly cared for  
than though you had a sister near you;  
and when you are well enough to know !  
me, we part again.” |  
For the crushed and wounded man  
was Clarence Livingston, the kneeling  
nurse, the girl to whom he had refused ‘  
his dying father to make offer of his  
‘hand, Lena Munroe.  
~ Long days and nights followed each  
other, and Clarence waked from stupor  
to mad delirium, in which he told his pa­  
tient nurse all of which she already  
knew, and much besides—told her of the  
wealth he had vowed never to touch, ly­  
ing in his solicitor’s hands for the girl  
he could not trace ; of strugzle and trial  
which he had gone through which made  
her blue eyes dim. |  
But he said no word of any woman  
whose love was his guerdon, and she  
was glad that was spared her.  
Once in a midnight hour, when the  
ward was silent and the lights low about  
them, he suddenly put forth his unin­  
jured hand and took one of hers; his  
eyes, brilliant with fever, were fastened  
on her face. $  
  
““My father loved youas a daughter,”  
he said, softly, and he told me you loved  
me ; but I did not believe it, and I want­  
ed him to leave me free. Child, why did  
vou fly from me? Did you fear I would  
learn to love you ?”  
She bent her face, and tears tlowed  
silently down her cheeks.  
It was delirinm, she knew; but she,  
who had been unable to forget, remem­  
bered that long hour in the early night  
too vividly not to again feel some of its  
pain as she heard him. |  
It was weeks later, when after a long  
sleep, he wakened to full consciousness  
one morning at day-dawn.  
The lights were low, the seene spec­  
tral, and his languid eyes turned from  
‘object to object.  
‘ At last they rested on the quiet figure  
‘of his nurse, asleep in her chair, and  
there they lingered.  
How sweet and girlish the weary face  
was under the stiff cap!— and sad, too,  
as this life was not such as her heart  
yearned for. And the hands lyingidly  
in her lap were so fair and white and  
slender, dainty enough to be decked  
with gems, tair enough to be kissed, but  
too frail and white for thetearing ot lincu  
and lifting of dying heads, he told him­  
self.  
  
Then a sort. of memory came to him  
of those soit fingers on his brow, when it  
had seemed burning; of that sweet face  
bent over him in his delirinm, when he  
had taken it for the facc of an angel.  
He had seen it ovefore, but where?  
Perhaps in one of his daydreams. Now  
he would never torget it, he told him­  
self, as, his own eyes closing, he drop­  
ped ofl to sleep.  
It was mid-day when we waked again  
and found her bending over him, and this  
time recognized her,  
“Lena!” he cried, trying to put out his  
hand.  
But he was too weak. It fell on the  
counterpane.  
“You know me ?&quot; she said,softly,turn­  
ing paler.  
*I know you, and I want to tell you,”  
he answered, faintly, and with a warm  
low in his eyes—*‘youare an heiress ;  
ﬁmre is no need for you to do this work.  
My father—&quot;  
*l know it all,” she broke in; “and  
that was why I left Lynn as I did. Did  
you think fy would begivgar you? And  
your father had been kind to me. [ for­  
gave him because he loved you. I will  
not go back ; I will not take a farthing  
of that money ; it is yours.”  
*Then share it with me,” he said soft­  
}y. “1 would not ask({ou once, because  
did not love you. Ido now, because  
love has grown in my heart for you in  
an hour. Lena, you have nursed me  
back to life from what must have  
been very nearly death. Will you  
learn to care enough for me to share my  
future ?”  
“You love me!” ghe said incredu­  
lously. “When did you learn the les­  
son P  
‘At day dawn, while I watched you  
  
asleep in your chair, ere I knew who you  
were. Lena, do not doubt me !”  
“I do not.” She knelt atthe cot and  
put back his hair, as he had dreamed she  
did while he was unconscious. ““And I  
will own to you Clareunce that I have  
loved you always since I first saw you.  
That was why I fled from Lynn.”  
*“And now you will come back ?”  
““For the same reason. she smiled, al­  
though her lips were tremulous. “Love  
sent me forth then; love recalls me  
now, and I will share the possessions  
with you which were neither honestly  
yours nor mine, but can belong fairly to  
us together. Yes, Clarence, I will go

 and Sketches.  
AFTER SIT TEARS  
—  
“I am giving you a treasure, my son  
Why do you hesitate ? Surely you have no  
other love ?”  
The sick man lilted himselt on his pil­  
low, and looked eagerly, tearfully, in the  
face above him.  
It was a haughty, yet frank countenance  
I —a face which mingled strength of will  
with pride, and tenderness with truth, and  
yet had enough poetic fife in it to make  
the request his father made of Clarence  
Livingstone a very hard one for him to  
grant? For Elmar Livingstone, dying,  
remembered the wrongs done by him in  
“the days of nature,” and, recalling a  
luckv venture, which, by enriching him.  
had beggared another, asked his son to  
take that other&#x27;s orphan daughter for his  
wife.  
i Clarence knew nothing of the hour of  
(temptation which saw his father&#x27;s fall—  
knew of no reason more powerful than  
Christian charity which had induced his  
father to adopt the penniless girl, when  
1 she was left alone in the world ; and. full  
| of fair dreams for his future, he shrank  
from a marriage with one whom he had  
rarely seen, in his yei.rs of study and  
travel, and who was to him a shy, awk­  
ward child—no more.  
•*I have no love,&quot; he answered. “Why  
do you ask this of me, my dear lather?  
Make any provision you wish for Miss  
Monroe; d-iwer her as rifchlv as you  
choose. But leave her, as I pray you to  
leave me, free. I have no love for her,  
nor she tor me ; we are strangers. Let  
us remain so. lest in mating us as you  
; would you do both lives injury.”  
“Stoop down. Clarence. She loves you;  
- you have been her hero, her idol, for  
years. I have fostered her idolatry, for I  
! have wished &gt;» atone for the wrong I did  
her; and there is but oneway—to make  
her the wife ot my only son. My boy  
: you will not refuse to make tny last hour  
easier ?  
“Father, I would purchase your peace  
■ with my life, were it possible. But there  
is surely some other way than this, and I  
will find it. What is the wrong of whieh  
you speak ? I must know it since I am to  
atone; and trust me, mv father, though it  
take my life, I will not fail to make the  
atonement a complete one.”  
&quot;There is no other way,” moaned the  
sick man, “and since you bid me unseal  
my lips I will tell you how I gained mv  
wealth, and planted my life with aloes of  
remorse, my son. My cordial ! The story  
is not long, but very hard to tell—very  
I ard, my boy—lor it will make you blush  
for your father.”  
And, while the summer night closed in,  
gray and spectral. Clarence Livingstone,  
listening to his father’s story of a credu­  
lous friend betrayed aud wealth snatched  
from a too trusting hand, bent his head in  
a humiliation wholly new and wholly in­  
tolerable to him.  
Without, in the clustering shadows of  
the veranda, drooping like a lily on its  
stem, stood Lena Monroe, drinking in the  
tale, with pulses beating as strongly as  
those in the breast of her Clarence, in  
her own girlish bosom pain as keen, re­  
gret as bitter; for she had loved Elmar  
Livingstone as a second father, and felt  
the sin of the dying as keenly as the  
wrong done the (lead.  
Besides, another pang was hers—tor  
Clarence had begged his father not to ask  
him to be more than a stranger to her!  
The story was told, and the old man  
lav panting on his pillows, his faee damp  
with dews of coming death ; anil the girl  
peering into the chamber with wide pain  
darkened eyes, saw Clarence on his knees  
beside the couch.  
“Forgive me, nty son! I did the wrong  
for you,” came hoarsely to her front the  
lifts of the dying. “Make her your wife,  
and all will be well. She is pure as a  
Mower unplucked. She lias grown dear to  
me as a daughter—and, my boy. she  
loves you.”  
A hot Mush crept into her faee at the  
low. broken words, but it died instantly,  
for Clarence was replying and she bent  
her lace to her hands as she listened.  
“She may he all you say,” came in the  
clear tones of the voting man ; “but she is  
no more to me than a Mower that I have  
no wish to gather It she loves me it is  
with a childish love which will not linger.  
Rest content, father; she shall not suffer  
through your—regard for me. I will give  
h ick every ill-gotten dollar. But 1 will  
keep nty freedom; 1 cannot sell it,  
father.”  
“What do you mean?”  
“That 1 w ill make over to Miss Munroc  
every acre that you leave me—every farth­  
ing that is her due. Nay, notone dissent­  
ing word,” as the old man strove to speak.  
Let me keep ray honesty, and make my  
own way w ith clean hands, if empty ones.  
I would not offer nty hand to your ward  
now, even though 1 loved her. which 1 do  
not.&quot;  
“Clarence, my son!”  
&quot;Father, say no more, but trust me;  
now you shall sleep.”  
The girl, shaken by hushed sobs,  
turned from the silvery night, and glided  
into the house like a shadow.  
Ere morning dawned, the soul of El­  
mar Livingstone had gone where human  
eye eauid not follow its Might, free of the  
clogging clav, to its judgment.  
And. as untraceable it would seem, as  
the spirit of the man who had wronged  
her. yet unguarded her youth, Lena Mon­  
roe had also gone with the night, leaving  
no token behind her,&#x27; bidding no farewell.  
*******  
Six years iatej the accident occurred on  
the midnight train, which tilled the hospi­  
tal of (I-with moaning life, or crushed  
and shapeless bodies in whieh was left  
scarcely strength to sigh. -f  
The nurses went Irorn pallet to pallet,  
holding bandages, aiding to bind up  
great, gaping wounds, shrinking from the  
sight of severed arms, but putting person­  
al feeling away before the great needs  
that met them.  
One nurse with sweet blue eyes tendei  
and pitiful, gave a low cry at last, as the  
surgeon, whose assistant she was, paused  
beside a eot on which a young man lav  
unconscious.  
“You know him?” the surgeon asked  
. her. regarding her blanched face curious­  
ly­  
She bent her head in silence, a sot  
bursting from Iter lips.  
Half an honr later he lay there undet  
her eyes, cold and still, with strips of  
linen across his bosom, a broken, ban­  
daged arm. and court plaster holding to­  
gether the red edges of a gash that ran  
perilously near the temple; and she knelt  
beside the cot with an ashen pallor in het  
young face, as she stroked back the hair  
from bis forehead.  
“After six years,” she whispered, soft­  
ly. “Oh my love, after six years, during  
which have l striven to forget your face?  
- to see it so cold and white ! Bui you shall  
I be more tenderly cared for than thon^h  
j you had a sister near you; and when you  
. are well enough to know me we part  
-again.”  
&#x27; i For the crushed and wouuded man was  
Clarence Livingston, the kneeling nurse  
  
the girl to whom he had refused his dying  
father to make offer of his band, Lena  
Munroe. . „ . .  
Long days and nights followed each  
other, and Clarence waked from stupor to  
mad delirium, in which he told his patient  
nurse all ol which she already knew, and  
much besides—told her of the wealth he  
had vowed never to touch, lying in his  
solicitor’s hands for the girl he could not  
trace; of struggle and trial which he had  
gone through, which made her blue eyes  
dim.  
But he said no word of any woman  
whose love was his guerdoD, and she was  
glad that was spared her.  
0 Once, in a midnight honr, when the  
ward was silent, and the lights low about  
them, he suddenly put forth his uninjured  
hand and took one of hers; his eyes,  
brilliant with fever, were fastened on her  
face.  
“My father loved you as a daughter,’  
he said, softly, and he told me you loved  
me; but I did not believe it, and I wanted  
him to leave me free. Child, why did you  
fly from me ? Did you fear I would learn  
to inve vou ?”  
She bent her face, and tears flowed  
silently down her cheeks.  
It was delirium, she knew; but she,  
who had been unable to forget, remem­  
bered that long hour in the early night too  
vividly not to again feel some of its pain  
as she heard him.  
It was weeks later, when after a long  
sleep, he wakened to full consciousness  
one morning at day dawn  
The lights were low. the scene spectral,  
and his languid eyes turned from object  
to object.  
At last they rested on the quiet figure  
of his nurse asleep in her chair, and there  
they lingered.  
How sweet ami girlish the weary face  
was under the stiff cap!—and sad, too, as  
this l&#x27;fe was not such as her heart yearned  
for. And the hands lying idly in her lap  
were so fair and white and slender, dain&#x27;y  
enough to be decked with gems, fair  
enough to be kissed, but too frail and  
white tor the tearing of linen and lifting  
of dying heads, he told himself.  
Then a sort of memory came to him ot  
those soft fingers on his brow, when it  
had seemed burning; ot that sweet face  
bent over him in his delirium, when he  
had taken it for the face of an angel.  
He had seen it before, but where?  
Perhaps in one ot his day dreams. Now  
he would never forget it, he told himself,  
as, his own eyes closing, he dropped ott  
to sleep.  
It was mid-day when he waked again  
and found her bending over him, and this  
time recognized her.  
“Lena!” he cried trying to put out his  
hand.  
But he was too weak. It fell on the  
counterpane.  
“You know me ?” she said, softly, turn­  
ing paler.  
“I know you, and I want to tell you,”  
he answered, faintly, and with a warm  
glow in his eyes—“you are an heiress;  
there is no need for you to do this work,  
My father—”  
“I know it all,” she broke in; “and  
that was why I left Lynn as I did. Did  
you think that I would beggar you? And  
your father has been kind to me. I for­  
give him because he loved you. 1 will  
not go back ; I will not take a farthing of  
that money; it is yours.”  
“Then share it with me,” he said softly.  
“I would not ask you once, because I did  
not love you. 1 do now, because love has  
grown in my heart for you in an hour.  
Lena, you have nursed me back to life  
from what must have been nearly death.  
Will you learn to care enough for me to  
share my future?&quot;  
“You love me!” she said incredulous­  
ly. “When did you learn the lesson ?”  
“At day dawn, while 1 watched you  
asleep in your chair, ere I knew who you  
were. Lena, do not doubt me !”  
“I do not.” She knelt at the cot and

AFter six Years  
&quot;I am giving you a treasure, my son.  
Why do you hesitate? Surely you have no  
other love?&quot;  
The sick man lifted himself on hispil-  
low, and looked eagerly, fearfully, in the  
face above him.  
It was a haughty, yet frank counte-  
nance--a face which mingled strength  
of will with pride, and tenderness with  
truth, and yet had enough poetic fire in it  
to make the request his father made of  
Clarence Livingstone a very hard one for  
him to grant. For Elmer Livingstone,  
dying, remembered the wrongs done by  
him in &quot;the days of nature,&quot; and, recalling  
a lucky venture, which by enriching him,  
had beggared another, asked his son to  
take that other&#x27;s orphan daughter for

Make any provision you may wish for

&quot;Stoop down, Clarence. She loves you;  
you have been her hero, her idol, for

I have wished to atone for the wrong!

&quot;FIther, I would purchase your peace  
with my life, were it possible. But there  
is surely some other way than this, and I  
will find it. What is the wrong of which  
you speak? I must know it since I am to  
atone; and trust me, my father, though  
it take my life, I will not fail to make  
the atonement a complete one.&quot;  
  
&quot;There is no other, moaned the sick  
man, &quot;and since you bid me unseal my  
lips I will tell you how I gained my  
wealth, and planted my life with aloes  
of remorse, my son. My cordial! The  
story is not long, but very hard to tell-  
very hard, my boy--for it will make you  
blush for your father.&quot;  
And, while the summer night closed  
in, gray and spectral, Clarence Living­  
stone, listening to his father&#x27;s story of a  
credulous friend betrayed and wealth  
snatched from a too trusting hand, bent  
his head in a humiliation wholly new  
and wholly intolerable to him.  
Without, in the clustering shadows  
of the veranda, drooping like a lily on  
its stem, stood Lena Monroe, drinking  
in the tale, with pulses beating as strong-  
ly as those in the breast of her Clarence.  
in her own girlish bosom pain as keen,  
regret as bitter; for she had loved Elmer  
Livingatone as a second father, and felt  
the sin of the dying as keenly as the  
wrong done the dead.  
Besides, another pang was hers--for  
Clarence had begged his father not to  
ask him to be more than a stranger to  
her.  
  
The story was told, and the old man  
lay panting on his pillow, his face damp  
with dews of coming death; and the gitl  
peering into the chamber with wide  
pain darkened eyes, saw Clarence on his  
knees beside the couch.  
&quot;Forgive me, my son! I did the wrong  
for you,&quot; came hoarsely to her from the  
lips of the dying. &quot;Make her your wife,  
and all will be well. She is pure as a  
flower unplucked. She has grown dear  
to me as a daughter--and, my boy, she  
loves you.&quot;  
A hot flush crept into her face at the  
low, broken words, but it died instantly,  
for Clarence was replying and she bent  
her face to her hands as she listened.  
&quot;She may be all you say, came in clear  
tones from the young man, &quot;but she is  
no more to me than a flower that I have no  
wish to gather. If she loves me it is  
with a childish love which will not lin­  
ger. Rest content, father; she shall not  
suffer through your--regard for me. I  
will give back every ill-gotten dollar.  
But I will keep my freedom; I cannot  
sell it, father.&quot;  
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  
&quot;That I will make over to Miss Mon-  
roe every acre that you leave me--every  
farthing that is her due. Nay, not one  
dissenting word,&quot; as the old man strove  
to speak. Let me keep my honesty, and  
make my own way with clean hands, if  
empty ones. I would not offer my hand to  
your ward now, even though I loved her  
which I do not.&quot;  
&quot;Clarence, my son!&quot;  
&quot;Father, say no more, but trust me;  
now you shall sleep.&quot;  
The girl, shaken by hushed sobs, turn-  
ed from the silvery night, and glided in-  
to the house like a shadow.  
Ere morning dawned, the soul of Ele  
mer Livingstone had gone where human  
eye could not follow its flight, free of  
the clogging clay, to its judgment.  
And, as untraceable it would seem, as  
the spirit of the man who had wronged  
her, yet unguarded her youth, Lena  
Monroe had also gone with the night,  
  
leaving no token behind her, bidding no  
farewell  
  
Six years later the accident occurted  
on the midnight train, which filled the  
hospital of G----with moaning life, or  
crushed and shapeless bodies in which  
was left scarcely strength to sigh.  
The nurses went from pallet to pallet,  
holding bandages, aiding to bind up  
great, gaping wounds, shriaking from  
the sight of severed arms, but putting  
personal feeling away before the great  
needs that met them  
One nurse with sweet blue eyes tender  
and pitiful, gave a low cry at last, as the  
surgeon, whose assistant she was, paused  
beside a cot on which a young man lay  
untonscious  
&quot;You know him?&quot; the surgeon asked  
her, regarding her blanched face cuni­  
ously.  
She bent her head in silence, a sob  
bursting from her lips  
Half an hour later he lay there under  
her eyes, cold and still, with strips of  
linen across his bosom, a broken, ban-  
daged arm, and court plaster holding  
together the red edges of a gash that  
ran perilously near the temple; and she  
knelt beside the cot with an ashen pallor  
in her young face, as she stroked back  
the haif from his forehead  
&quot;After six years,&quot; she whispered, soft­  
ly. &quot;Oh, my love, after six years, dur-  
ing which I have striven to forget your  
face, to see it so cold and white! But  
you shall be more tenderly cared for than  
if you had a sister near you; and when  
you are well enough to know me we part  
again.&quot;  
Fot the crushed and wounded man was  
Clarence Livingston, the kneeling nurse,  
the girl to whom he had refused his  
dying father to make offer of his hand,  
Lena Monroe,  
Long days and nights followed each  
other, and Clarence waked from stupor  
to mad delirium, in which he told his  
patient nurse all of which she already  
knew, and much besides- told her of the  
wealth he had vowed never to touch,  
lying in his solicitor&#x27;s hands for the girl  
he could not trace; of struggle and trial  
which he had gone through, which made  
her blue eyes dim.  
But he said no word of any woman  
whose love was his guerdon, and she was  
glad that was spared her.  
Once, in a midnight hour, when the  
ward was silent, and the lights low about  
them, he suddenly put forth his uninjured  
hand and took one of hers; his eyes,  
brilliant with fever, were fastened on her  
face  
  
&quot;My father loved you as a daughter,  
he said, softly, &quot;and he told me you  
loved me; but I did not believe it, and  
I wanted him to leave me free.  
why did you fly from me? Did you fear  
I would learn to love you?&quot;  
She bent her face, and tears flowed  
silently down her cheeks  
It was delirium, she knew; but she,  
who had been unable to forget, remem­  
beted that long hour in the early night  
too vividly not to again feel some of its  
pain as she heard her.  
It was weeks later, when after a long  
sleep, he wakened to full consciousness  
one morning at day dawn.  
The lights were low, the scene spec­  
tral, and his languid eyes turned from  
object to object.  
At last they rested on the quiet figure  
of his nurse asleep in her chair, and there  
they lingered.  
How sweet and girlish the weary face  
was under the stiff cap!--and sad, too,  
as this life was not such as her heart  
yearned for. And the hands lying idle  
in her lap were so fair and white and  
slender, dainty enough to be decked with  
gems, fair enough to be kissed, but too  
frail and white for the tearing of linen  
and lifting of dying heads, he told him-  
self.  
  
Then a sort of memory came to him of  
those soft fingers on his brow, when it  
had seemed burning; of that sweet face  
bent over him in his delirium, when he  
had taken it for the face of an angel  
He had seen it before, but where?  
Pethaps in one of his day dreams. Now  
he would never forget it, he told himself.  
as, his own eyes closing, he dropped off  
to sleep.  
It was mid-day when he waked again  
and found her bending over him, and this  
time recognized him  
&quot;Lena!&quot; he cried, trying to put out  
his hand.  
But he was too weak. It fell on the  
counterpane.  
&quot;You know me?&quot; she said, softly,  
turning paler.  
&quot;I know you, and I want to tell you,&quot;  
he answered, faintly, and with a warm  
glow in his eyes- &quot;you are an heiress;  
there is no need for you to do this work.  
My father-&quot;  
&quot;I know it all,&quot; she broke in, &quot;and  
that was why I left Lyan as I did. Did  
you think I would beggar you? And  
your father has been kind to me. I for­  
give him because he loved you. I will  
not go back; I will not take a farthing  
of that money; it is yours.  
&quot;Then share it with me,&quot; he said  
softly. &quot;I would not ask you once, be  
cause I did not love you. I do now, be-  
cause love has grown in my heart for you  
in an hour. Lena, you have nursed me  
back to life from what must have been  
nearly death. Will you learn to care  
enough for me to share my future?&quot;  
&quot;You love me!&quot; she said incredulous-  
ly. &quot;When did you learn the lessoa?&quot;
