O! say can you see, by the dawn&#x27;s early light,  
What so proudly we hail&#x27;d at the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming,  
whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,  
O&#x27;er the ramparts we watch&#x27;d, were so gallantly streaming?  
And the Rockets&#x27; red glare, the Bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  
O! say, does that star-spangled Banner yet wave,  
O&#x27;er the Land of the free, and the home of the brave?  
  
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe&#x27;s haughty host in dread silence reposes.  
What is that, which the breeze o&#x27;er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning&#x27;s first beam,  
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream.  
&#x27;Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,  
That the havoc of War and the battle&#x27;s confusion,  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has wash&#x27;d out their foul foot-steps pollution.  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave,  
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave;  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
O! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,  
Between their lov&#x27;d home, and the war&#x27;s desolation,  
Blest with vict&#x27;ry and peace, may the Heav&#x27;n-rescued land,

Oh, say, does the Star Spangled Banner yet wave  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?  
  
‘*On the shore dimly seen, thro’ the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host, in dread silence reposes,  
What is that which the breeze o’er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,

‘* And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,  
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has washed out their foul footstep’s pollution !  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave

And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave,

‘* Oh, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand  
Between their loved home and wild war’s desolation ;

Oh, say, can you see by the dawn’s early light  
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleam-  
ing—  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous  
fight,  
O’er the ramparts we watch’d, were so gallantly stream-  
ing?  
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave  
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?  
  
On that shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,  
  
What is that which the breeze o’er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?  
  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,  
  
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream;  
  
’Tis the star-spangled banner; oh, long may it wave  
  
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!  
  
And where are the foes who so vauntingly swore  
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footsteps’ pollu-
