O! say can you see, by the dawn&#x27;s early light,  
What so proudly we hail&#x27;d at the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming,  
whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,  
O&#x27;er the ramparts we watch&#x27;d, were so gallantly streaming?  
And the Rockets&#x27; red glare, the Bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  
O! say, does that star-spangled Banner yet wave,  
O&#x27;er the Land of the free, and the home of the brave?  
  
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe&#x27;s haughty host in dread silence reposes.  
What is that, which the breeze o&#x27;er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning&#x27;s first beam,  
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream.  
&#x27;Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,  
That the havoc of War and the battle&#x27;s confusion,  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has wash&#x27;d out their foul foot-steps pollution.  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave,  
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave;  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
O! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,  
Between their lov&#x27;d home, and the war&#x27;s desolation,  
Blest with vict&#x27;ry and peace, may the Heav&#x27;n-rescued land,  
Praise the power that hath made and preserv&#x27;d us a nation!  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  
And this be our motto–––&quot;In GOD is our Trust!&quot;  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave,

Paper.  
The annexed song was composed under  
the following circumstances—A gentleman  
had left Baltimore, in a flag of truce, for the  
purpose* of getting released from the British I  
fleet a friend of his, who had been captured!  
at Marlborough. He went as far as the mouth  
of the Patuxent, and was not permitted to  
return lest the intended attack on Baltimore  
He was therefore  
should be disclosed.  
brought up the bay to the mouth of the Pa­  
tapsco, where the flag vessel was kept under  
the guns of a frigate, and he was compelled  
to witness the bombardment of Fort M’Hen­  
ry, which the Admiral had boasted that he  
would carry in a few hours, and that the city  
must fall. He watched the flag at the Fort  
through the whole day with an anxiety that  
can be better felt than described, until the  
night prevented him from seeing it. In the  
night he watched the Bomb-Shells, and at  
early dawn his eye was again greeted by the  
proudly-waving flag of his country.  
Tune—ANACREON in Heaven.  
O ’ say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,  
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s  
last gleaming,  
W hose broad stripes and bright stars through  
the perilous fight,  
O’er the ramparts we watch&#x27;d were so gal­  
lantly streaming ?  
And the Rockets&#x27; red -glare, the Bombs bursting  
in air, ...  
Gave proof through the night that our Flag was  
still there ;  
O ! say, does that star-spangled Banner  
yet wave,  
O’er the Land of the free, and the home  
of the brave ?  
  
Ou the shore, dimly seen through the mists of  
the deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence  
reposes,  
What is that, which the breeze o’er the tower­  
ing steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half disclo­  
ses ?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first  
beam,  
in full glory reflected now shines on the  
stream.  
’Tis the star-spangled banner. O ! long  
may it wave  
O’er the land of the free and the home  
of the brave.  
And where is that band who so vauntingly  
swore,  
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confu­  
sion  
A home and a country should leave us no more ?  
Their blood has wash’d out their foul foot­  
steps’ pollution.  
Mo refuge could save the hireling and slave,  
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the  
grave;  
And the star-spangled banner in tri­  
umph doth wave,  
O’er the land of the free and the home

O ! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,  
Between their lov’d home, and the war’s de­  
solation,  
Blest with vict’ry and peace, may the Hleav&#x27;n­  
rescued land,  
Praise the power that hath made and pre­  
serv’d us a nation ’.  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is  
just.

And this be our motto—“ In God is out

one of the most  
pure and talented patriots the country ever  
produced—he has been proseribed for opinion’s  
sake and a Federalist of the Adams school re­  
warded with his place. Is it possible that the  
Star-spangled Banner waves o’er the land of the  
free, when such a Patriot as Mr Key is proscri­  
bed, and such a Tory as Daniel Webster—the  
Blue-light, Hartford Convention Webster, is  
appointed Secrewary of State ?  
Fhe talented editor of the Obio Statesman in  
commenting upon Mr Key’s removal, has the  
following spirited remark—The removal of Mr  
Key was no doubt made for cause, &amp; that cause  
can be thus briefly given. A friend of Mr Key  
was taken prisoner during the late war by the  
British, and that gentleman, with a generosity  
peculiar to himself, went on board the British  
fleet, then in Chesapeake Bay, protected by  
a flag of truce, to endeavor to effect his lib­  
eration. The British commander had determi­  
ned secretly that night to attack Baltimore, and  
Mr Key was detained a prisoner on board one  
of the English vessels, lest the intended attack  
on Bal:imore should be frustrated. In passing  
Fort McHenry, the British fleet was discovered  
and a fire opened on them, which wasreturned.  
During the night Mr Key could obly tell by  
the flash of the cannon, that the flag—the “star  
spangled banner”—of his country still waved in  
triumph over the Fort. During that night he  
gave vent to his feelings in that justly admired  
national song which we copy below. Who af­  
ter reading it, will dare say, that io itself it  
does not contain sufficient cause to justify his  
removal from office, by Daniel Webster, a man  
who, upon the floor of Congress, taunted the  
democracy with the reverses our gallant little  
army met with in the commencement of the  
Jate war, und who systimatically opposed the fur­  
nishing of arms or provisions to cur half naked  
and half starved soldiers, who were defending  
their native land from the ‘fool footsteps’ pollu­  
tion * of a foreign foe.”  
The following song is the one referred to—  
«STAR SPANGLED BANNER  
  
%! SAY can you see, by the dawn’s early light,  
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleam­  
ing,  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the peril­  
ous fight,  
O’er the ramparts we watch’d where so gallantly  
streaming?  
And the rocke.’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our‘flag was still  
there ;  
O! say does that Star-spangled Banner yet wave,  
Q’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave ?  
  
«Onthe shore dimly seen through the msté of the deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,  
What is that which the breeze o’er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blowe, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s firet beam,  
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream:  
«Tis the Star-spangled Banner—O! long may it wave,  
O’er the land of the free,and the home of the brave.  
  
« And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,  
That the havoc of war and the battle’s ccnfusion,  
A home and a country, should leave us no more!  
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footsteps pollu­  
tion.  
Nor refuge could save the hireling ard slave,  
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,  
And the Star-spangled Banner in triamph doth wave, .  
O’er the land of the {ree, and the home of the brave.  
  
«O thus be it ever, when freemen shallstand,  
Between their loy’d home, and the war’s desolation,  
Blest with vict’ry and peace, may the Heaven rescu’d  
land  
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a  
nation! :  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  
And this be our motto—**ln God is our trust;”  
And the Star-spangled Banner in trinmpb shall wave,

of the present administration have  
hardly expired, and almost every Democratic fore­  
man is discharged.  
REMOVAL OF MR. KEY.  
Mr. Francis Key, the author of the &quot;Star  
Spangled Banner,&quot; has been removed from the  
office of District Attoiney, he being altogether too  
much of an American in his feelings to suit the  
Federal Cabinet with a blue-light Federalist at its  
head. Every man who has one spark of the patri  
otic fire in his bosom, which animated ihe heroes  
of the war which Webster opposed, will detest the  
British influence which dictated Mr. Key&#x27;s removal.  
We dare say ihis song is offensive to the British  
Diplomatists, and the author not less so, with whom  
Mr. Webster is now in controversy, and to whose  
haughty insolence he has opposed a recreant spiritt  
worthy of colonial vassalage. When the British  
Minister demanded the release of McLeod, Web­  
ster replied, that if the trial were to be had before  
the United States Court, a nolle prosequi, would  
be directed the suit would be stopped. This is  
not the manner in which the author of the &quot;Star  
Spangled Banner&quot; would feel and act, and he is,  
consequently, unfit to be a District Attorney under  
a Federal Administration.  
We copy the following spirited remarks from the  
Ohio Statesman, with the song annexed. No one  
can read it without being assured that the author is  
a patriot of the &quot;true fire of the flint,&quot; and one that  
might safely be trusted in any public station yea,  
one whom the country should be proud to reward  
by some demonstration of public confidence :  
&quot;The removal of Mr. Key was no doubt made  
for cause, and that cause can be thus briefly given.  
A friend of Mr. Key was taken prisoner during the  
late war by the British, and ihat gentleman, with a j  
generosity peculiar to himself, went on board the!  
British fleet, then in Chesapeake Bay, protected by  
a fiag of truce, to endeavor to effect his liberation.  
The British commander had determined secretly  
that night to attack Baltimore, and Mr. Key was  
detained a prisuner on board one of the English  
vessels, lest the intended attack on Baltimore should  
be frustrated. In passing Fort McHenry, the Bii­  
tish fleet was discovered and a fire opened upon  
them, which was returned. During the night, Mr.  
Key could only tell by the flash of the cannon, ihat  
the flag the &quot;star spangled banner&quot; of his  
country still waved in triu nph over the Fort. Du­  
ring that night he gave vent to his feelings in that  
i&#x27;ustly admired national song which we copy be­  
ow. Who, after reading it,-will dare say, that in  
itself it does not contain sufficient cause to justify  
his removal from office, by Daniel Webster, a man  
who, upon the floor of Congress, taunted the de­  
mocracy which the reverses of our gallant little army  
met with in the commencement of the late war,  
and who systematically opposed the furnishing of  
arms or provisions to our half naked and half starved  
soldiers, who were defending their native land from  
the &quot;foul footsteps&#x27; pollution&quot; of a foreign foe.  
We need not say Mr. Key is a democrat, for none  
other could possess the feelings which dictated this  
song.

THE STAR SPANGLKD &quot;BANNER&quot;  
The story connected with this celebrated poem  
by FnAucis Scott Ksv, it wen know, but will  
. tear repetition : VZ . . -,  
A gentleman had left Baltimore.with a flag of  
Wnc for the purpose of getting released from the  
f.&#x27;v JH&#x27;D,d of his- wn0 hd ben csptured  
at Marlborough. He went as far as the mouth of  
!v ? wtuxnt&#x27; nd not permitted to return lest  
toe intended attack on Baltimore should be disclosed.  
  
.u . orougnt up tne bay to the mouth  
5 pUp,co&#x27; lrhere th fla8 Tessel was kept un­  
der the guns of a frigate and he was compelled to  
Witness the bombardment f Fort-McHenry, which  
the Admiral had boasted he would carry m a few  
hours, and that tho city must fall. He watched  
the flag at the Fort hrough the whole day, with an  
anxiety that can be better felt than described, until  
tneiught preTented him from seeing it. In the  
nightie watched the bomb- shells,&#x27; and at early dawn  
kia eye was again grew ed by the flag of his country :  
THE ST, AR -SPANGLED BANNER.  
Oh ! say, can jom aee by the dawns early light,

T HE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.  
  
The story connected with this cele­  
brated Poem by Francis Scott Key, is  
well known, but will bear repetition:  
A gentleman had left Baltimore with  
a flag of truce, for the purpose of get  
ting released from the British fleet a  
friend of his, who had been captured at  
Marlborough. He went as far as the  
mouth of the Pawtuxent, and was not  
permitted to return lest the intended at­  
tack on Baltimore should be disclosed.  
He was therefore brought up the bay to  
the mouth of the Patapsco, where the  
flag vessel was kept under the guns of  
a frigate and he was compelled to wit­  
ness the bombardment of Fort McHen­  
ry, which the Admiral had boasted he  
would carry in a few hours, and that the  
city must fall. He watched the flag at  
at the Fort through the whole day, with  
an anxiety that can be better felt than  
described, until the night prevented him  
from seeing it. In the night he watch­  
ed the bomb-shells, and at early dawn  
his eye was again greeted by the flag of  
his country:  
  
THE STAr-SPAnGLeD Bann  
  
Oh! say, can you see by the dawn&#x27;s early light,  
what so proudly we haird at the twilight s last gleam  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro&#x27; the perilous  
fight,  
O&#x27;er the ramparts we watch&#x27;d were so gallantly  
streaming.  
And the rocket&#x27;s red glare, bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof thro&#x27; the night that our flag was still there  
Oh, say, does the star-spangled banner still wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?  
On the shore dimly seen thro&#x27; the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe&#x27;s haughty host in dread silence reposes,  
What is that which the breeze o&#x27;er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning&#x27;s first beam,  
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;  
&#x27;Tis the star-spangled banner, oh, long may it wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.  
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,  
That the havoc of war, and the battle&#x27;s confusion,

Their blood has wash&#x27;d out their foul footprints&#x27; pol-

And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,

THE STAR-SPAITGIiED BANNEB.  
We publish this celeb; ated song, as pecu­  
liarly appropriate at the present time, together  
with an account of the circumstances under  
which it originated:  
A gentleman had left Baltimore, with a flag  
of truce, for the purpose of getting released  
from the British fleet a friend of hi.-&quot;, who had  
b.cn captured at Marllioiougli. He went as  
tar as the mouth of the Pntuxent, and was not  
permitted to return, lest the intended atoick on  
Baltimore should be disclosed. He was there­  
fore brought up the bay to the mouth of the  
Patftpsco, where the flag-vessel was kept under  
the guns of.-, frigate; and he was compelled to  
witness the bombardment of Fort MTIerry,  
which the admiral had boasted he would carry  
I in a few hour.&quot;, and that the city must fall.  
lie watched the flag at the fort thiough Ihc  
j whore day, wiiVan anxiety that Call be better  
IVlt than described, until the night prevented  
linn liom seeing it. In the night he watched  
the bumb-.-dielli, and at early dawn his eye was  
again greeted by iho pi uudly-waving tlag of  
his country. &#x27;

A gentleman had left Balti­

getting released from the British fleet a friend  
of his, who had been captured at Marlborough.  
He vest ns far as the mouth of the Patuxent,

was therefore brought up the bay to the mouth

THE STAR SPANOGLED BANNER.  
  
Oh! .l?’h?n you see, by the dawn&#x27;s early

light&#x27;s last genmlnf.: S  
Whose stripes and bright stars, through  
the perilous fight,  
O&#x27;er the ramparts we watched, were so  
gallantly streaming.  
And the rocket&#x27;s red glare, the bombs  
bursting in air,

Chorus—  
Oh! ua?&#x27; does that star spangled banner  
still wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of  
the brave!  
On the shore, dimly seen through the mist  
of the deep,  
Where the foe&#x27;s haughty host in dread  
silence reposes;  
What is that which the breese, o&#x27;er the  
towerlnf steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half congceals, half  
discloses?  
Now {t catches the gleam of the morn-  
Imi&#x27;a first beam,  
In full glory reflected, now shines in  
the stream.  
Chorus—  
&#x27;Tis the star spangled banner, oh, long  
may it wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of  
the brave!  
And where is that band who so vaunting­  
ly swore,  
‘Mid the havoc of war and the battle&#x27;s  
confusion,  
A home and a country they&#x27;d leave us no  
more?  
Their blood has washed out their foul  
footsteps&#x27; pollution;  
No relfuga could save the hireling and  
slave  
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of

Chorus—  
And the star spangled banner in triminph  
shall wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home f  
the brave!  
Oh! tllmudbe it ever, when freemen sh:ll  
stand,  
Between their loved home and the war&#x27;s  
desolation;  
Blest with victory and peace, may the  
heaven-rescued land  
Pralse the Power that hath made and  
preserved us a nation,  
Then conquer we must, when our cause

And this our motto: ‘“ln God is our

Chorus—  
And the star spangled banner in triumph

While the land of the free is the home of  
the brave.  
When oHr land is illumined with liberty&#x27;s

Down, down with the traitor, that dares

Oh, say, can you see by the dawn’s early light  
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleam-  
ing—  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous  
fight,  
O’er the ramparts we watch’d, were so gallantly stream-  
ing?  
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave  
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?  
  
On that shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,  
  
What is that which the breeze o’er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?  
  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,  
  
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream;  
  
’Tis the star-spangled banner; oh, long may it wave  
  
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!  
  
And where are the foes who so vauntingly swore  
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footsteps’ pollu-  
tion.  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave  
From the terror of flight, or thé gloom of the grave;  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave  
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!  
  
Oh, thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand  
Between their loved homes and the war’s desolation.  
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued  
land  
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a  
nation,  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just;  
And this be our motto: “In God is our trust”;  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave  
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
