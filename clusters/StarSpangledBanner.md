O! say can you see, by the dawn&#x27;s early light,  
What so proudly we hail&#x27;d at the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming,  
whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,  
O&#x27;er the ramparts we watch&#x27;d, were so gallantly streaming?  
And the Rockets&#x27; red glare, the Bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  
O! say, does that star-spangled Banner yet wave,  
O&#x27;er the Land of the free, and the home of the brave?  
  
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe&#x27;s haughty host in dread silence reposes.  
What is that, which the breeze o&#x27;er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning&#x27;s first beam,  
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream.  
&#x27;Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,  
That the havoc of War and the battle&#x27;s confusion,  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has wash&#x27;d out their foul foot-steps pollution.  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave,  
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave;  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,  
O&#x27;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
O! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,  
Between their lov&#x27;d home, and the war&#x27;s desolation,  
Blest with vict&#x27;ry and peace, may the Heav&#x27;n-rescued land,

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through

As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half dis­

Now it catches the gleam of the morning&#x27;s

Oh! say can you see by the dawn’s early light,  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming;  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,  
O’er the ramparts we hailed were so gallantly streaming?  
  
  
  
  
  
The Star Spangled Banner.  
  
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there?  
Oh! say does that star-spangled banner still wave  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?  
  
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes;  
  
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses ?  
  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,  
  
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream ;  
’Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
And where is the band who so vauntingly swore  
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution.  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave, »  
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave;  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave,  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
Oh thus be it ever when freemen shall stand  
Between their loved homes and war’s desolation;  
Blessed with victory and peace may this heaven-rescued land  
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation;  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,

The expression, “his foul footstep’s pollution,” refers to  
a British officer who boasted in the hearing of Mr. Key  
that_Fort McHenry would soon be reduced, a mistaken

THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.  
  
O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,  
  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the clouds of the  
  
Sight, (1)  
  
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming ?  
And the rocket’s red glare—the bombs bursting in air—  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there ;  
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave  
O’er the !and of the free and the home of the brave ?  
  
On that shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,  
  
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering stcep,  
As it fitfully btows, half (2) conceals, half (2) discloses ?  
  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,  
  
In full glory reflected, now shines on (3) the stream.  
  
‘Tis the star-spangled banner—O long may it wave  
  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
And where is the foe that (4) so vauntingly swore  
That (5) the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion  
A home and a country should (6) leave us no more ?  
This (7) blood has washed out Aés (8) foul footstep’s pollution.  
No refuge could save the hircling and slave  
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave.  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
O, thus be it ever! when freemen (9) shall stand  
Between their (10) loved homes and the war&#x27;s desolation.  
Blest with victory and peace, may the heay’n rescued land  
Praise the Power that hath made and preserv&#x27;d us a nation.  
Then conquer we must when our cause it is just,  
And this be our motto, In God is our trust.

STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.  
  
  
  
pacing the deck of the vessel, composed that  
  
immortal song, ‘ The Star-Spangled Banner.’ The  
rude, first draught of it was written on the back of  
a letter, and he wrote it out at full length on his  
arrival in Baltimore.” Soon after, it was printed,  
and at once became exceedingly popular. ‘‘It  
was sung everywhere, in public and private, and  
created intense enthusiasm.”  
  
Although the famous song is no doubt well  
known to most of our readers, we here reprint it in  
full, as it was originally written by Mr. Key:  
  
Tue STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.  
  
O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming;  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro’ the perilous fight  
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming

THE SONO OF THE DAT.  
O, say can you see by the dawn’s early light.  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s  
last gleaming—  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through  
the clouds of the fight.  
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gal­

And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs burstiug

Gave proof through the night that our flag

O say, does that Star Spangled Banner yet  
wave  
O’er the land ot the free and the home of the  
brave?  
On that shore dimly seen through the mists of  
the deep.  
Where the foe’s haughty host In dread silence  
reposes.  
What Is that which the breeze, o’er the tower­  
ing steep,  
As It fitfully blows, now conceals, now dis­  
closes?  
Now It catches the gleam ot the morning’s first  
beam.  
In full glory reflected, now shlues on the

O’er the laud of the free and the home of the

And where is that band who so vauntingly

That the havoc of war and the battle’s con­  
fusion  
A home and a country should leave us no moret  
Their blood has washed out their foul foot­  
steps’ pollution.  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave

t know the result of the  
attack until the- morning light should  
make all plain, and they waited with  
sickening anxiety.  
  
Here it was that the song began. As  
our hero paced the deck, almost over-  
whelmed with eager suspense, the noble  
utterance came to him. He took a letter  
from his pocket and on the back jotted  
down the first rude draft of it as the  
dawn spread softly over the sky and  
showed, clearly and more clearly, the un-  
shaken defense, with the beloved flag  
above it. So in the hour of victory, out  
of the midst of the conflict, issued the  
matchless battle song—The Star-Span-  
gled Banner.  
  
O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last  
gleaming ;  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro’ the peril-  
ous fight  
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly  
streaming—  
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in  
  
air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still  
there ;  
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?  
  
From the shore dimly seen thro’ the mists of the  
  
deep,  
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence re-  
  
poses,  
What is that which the breeze o’er the towering  
  
steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first  
beam,  
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream ;  
’Tis the star-spangled banner—O long may it wave  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!  
  
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore  
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion  
  
A home and a country should leave us no more?  
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’  
  
pollution.  
  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave  
  
F:om the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave;  
  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave  
  
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
  
And thus be it ever, when freeman shall stand  
Between their loved homes and the war’s desola-  
tion;  
Blest with vict’ry and peace may this Heaven-res-  
cued land  
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved  
us a nation.  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  
And this be our motto: “ In God is our trust’’;  
And the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave
