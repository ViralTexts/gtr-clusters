TRUE PHILOSOPHY—THE FARMERS.—Two farmers who were neighbors, had their crop of early peas killed by the frost. One of them came to condole with the other on their misfortune. &quot;Ah!&quot; cried he, &quot;how unfortunate we have been, neighbor! I have done nothing but fret ever since. But, bless me! you seem to have a fine healthy crop coming up just now: what are these?&quot;—&quot;These, said the other, &quot;why, these are what I sowed immediately after my loss.&quot; &quot;What, coming up already?&quot; cried the fretter. &quot;Yes; while you were fretting I was working.&quot; &quot;What! and don&#x27;t you fret when you have a loss?&quot; &quot;Yes, but I always put it off until I have repaired the mischief.&quot;—&quot;Lord! why then you&#x27;ve no need to fret at all.&quot; &quot;True&quot; replied the industrious gardener, &quot;and that&#x27;s the very reason; in truth, it is very pleasant to have no longer reason to think of misfortunes; and it is astonishing how many might be repaired by a little alacrity and energy.&quot;

the uncertain tenure of earthly goods, in a case lately re­  
ported in the London papers. It was a prosecution for per­  
jury, in the course of which it was given in evidence, that  
the prosecutrix, Lady Parker, becoming security for her  
sister, Lady Lake, for the sum of £19,000, in consequence  
of legal proceedings for its recovery, became an inmate of

True Philosophy—The Farmers.—Two farmers, who

already ?” cried the fretier. “ Yes ; while you were fretting I  
was working.” “ What! and dont you fret when you have a  
loss ? ’ “ Yes, but I always put it off until I have repaired the  
mischief.” Lord ! why then you’ve no need to fret at all.”

think of misfortunes; and it is astonishing how many might be

small, within their reach. At the fall of a  
scanty rivulet, they set up their little man­  
ufactury of wooden buttons or combs ;  
they plant a barren hill-side with broom­  
corn, and make it into brooms at the bot­  
tom, and on the top they erect a wind-mill.  
Thus at the single spot you may see the air  
the earth, and the water, all at work for

whitened to its extremities with the sails of  
their ships, and the land is covered with

True Philosophy— The Farmers.—Two

crops of early peas killed by the frost. One  
of them came to condole with the other on  
their misfortune. ‘‘Ah!” cried he ‘‘how  
unfortunate we have been, neighbor! I

bless me! you seem to have a fine heal­

these are what I sowed immediately after  
my loss.”” ‘“What, coming up already?&quot;  
cried the fretter. ‘“Yes, while you were  
fretting, I was working.’”” ““What! and  
don’t you fret when you have a loss?”’—  
“Yes, but I always put itoff until I have  
repaired the mischief.”” *““Why, then you  
have no need to fret at all.”” ¢“True,’’ re­  
plied the industrious gardener, ‘‘and that’s  
the very reason; in truth, it is very pleas­  
ant to have no longer reason to think of  
misfortunes; and it is astonishin;i how ma­  
ny might bo repaisvd by @ llltie alacrity ana

A worf more about potatoes. After a  
huadred experiments in cutting and not cut­  
ting for seed, the practice is finally well  
established among the best farmers in the  
country, that it is most profitable to plant  
full-sized, well formed, whole potatoes—  
cutting none, except such as are very large,  
which contain too marg eyes for a hill.

each have a place in the world, which it is :  
our duty ana privilege to occupy. &#x27; There is  
a place where God wants us to be, and to

Do not fret over what you call misfortunes  
and reverses, but rather seek to retrieve  
them. Folding your arms lazily will not  
help you. There is an old story of two  
gardeners who were neighbors, they had  
their crops of early peas killed by the frost.

then you have no need to fret at all.&quot;  
&quot;True,&quot; replied the industrious- gardener,

told of two gardeners who were  
neighbours, and had their crops of early  
peas destroyed by frost. One of them  
went to condole with the other on this  
common misfortune. &#x27; Ah !&#x27; he cried, &#x27;

fretter. &#x27;Yes; while you were fretting I

hinder rather than help oureelves by  
fretting. Some men have undermined their  
reason by fretting, and thus sent  
themselves into lunatic asylums. Taking  
it broadly, it is one of the most  
mischievous habits in the world. One of  
the greatest of living orators hss said,  
&#x27; It is not work that kills men, it is  
woiry. Work is healthy; you can hardly  
put more upon a man than he can bear.  
Worry is rust upon the* blade. It is not
