TRUE PHILOSOPHY—THE FARMERS.—Two farmers who were neighbors, had their crop of early peas killed by the frost. One of them came to condole with the other on their misfortune. &quot;Ah!&quot; cried he, &quot;how unfortunate we have been, neighbor! I have done nothing but fret ever since. But, bless me! you seem to have a fine healthy crop coming up just now: what are these?&quot;—&quot;These, said the other, &quot;why, these are what I sowed immediately after my loss.&quot; &quot;What, coming up already?&quot; cried the fretter. &quot;Yes; while you were fretting I was working.&quot; &quot;What! and don&#x27;t you fret when you have a loss?&quot; &quot;Yes, but I always put it off until I have repaired the mischief.&quot;—&quot;Lord! why then you&#x27;ve no need to fret at all.&quot; &quot;True&quot; replied the industrious gardener, &quot;and that&#x27;s the very reason; in truth, it is very pleasant to have no longer reason to think of misfortunes; and it is astonishing how many might be repaired by a little alacrity and energy.&quot;
