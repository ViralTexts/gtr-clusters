Backward, turn backward, oh Time, in your flight,  
Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore;  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Backward, flow backward, oh tide of the years!  
I am so weary of toil and of tears—  
Toil without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Take them, and give me my childhood again!  
I have grown weary of dust and decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap,—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, oh mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded, our faces between;  
Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain  
Long I to-night for your presence again;  
Come from the silence so long and so deep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Over my heart, in the days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shown;  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours;  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain;  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calms o&#x27;er my heavy lids creep—  
Rock me to sleep; mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old;  
Let it drop over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light,  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Mother, dear mother! the years have been long  
Since I last listened to your lullaby song;  
Since then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a dream;  
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep,  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!

for you  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded, our faces between,  
Yet, with strong yearning and passionate  
pain,  
Long I to-night for your presence again.  
Come from the silence so long and so deep,—  
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.  
  
Over my heart, in the days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shone  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient, like yours  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the worid-weary  
brain.  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calms o&#x27;er my heavy lids  
creep,  
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

Backward, turn backward, O time in your flight,  
Make me a child again just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore;  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Suioothe the few silver threads out of my hair;  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep  
Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep!  
Backward, flow backward, O tide of the years!  
I am so weary of toil and of tears  
Toil without recompense, tears all in vain  
Take them, and give me my childhood ayain!  
I have grown weary of dust and decay.  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away;  
Weary of sowing for others to reap  
Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep!  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded our faces between,  
Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain  
Long I to-night for your presence again.  
Come from the silence so long and so deep  
Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep.  
Over my heart in the days that are llown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shown;  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours;  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and world-weary brain.  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calm o&#x27;er my heavy lids creep­  
Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep.  
Come, let your brown hair just lighted with sold.  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old;  
Let it drop over my forehead to-night!  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light;  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;  
Lovingly, softly its bright billows sweep  
Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep.  
Mother, dear mother, the years have been long  
Since I last listened to your lullaby song;  
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a dream,  
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face,  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep  
Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep.
