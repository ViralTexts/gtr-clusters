Backward, turn backward, oh Time, in your flight,  
Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore;  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Backward, flow backward, oh tide of the years!  
I am so weary of toil and of tears—  
Toil without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Take them, and give me my childhood again!  
I have grown weary of dust and decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap,—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, oh mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded, our faces between;  
Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain  
Long I to-night for your presence again;  
Come from the silence so long and so deep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Over my heart, in the days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shown;  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours;  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain;  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calms o&#x27;er my heavy lids creep—  
Rock me to sleep; mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old;  
Let it drop over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light,  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Mother, dear mother! the years have been long  
Since I last listened to your lullaby song;  
Since then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a dream;  
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep,  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!

Rock me to sleep, mother, took me to sleep !  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old ;  
Let it fall over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light;  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore ;  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep ;  
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep !  
Mother, dear mother, the years have been long  
Since I last hushed to your lullaby song ;  
Since then, and unto my soul it ohall seem,  
Womanhood’s years have been but a dream.  
Clasped to your arms in a loving embrace.

Backward, turn backward, O time, in your  
flight* Make me a child again just for  
to-uight 1 Mnihrr rnmc hack from the  
echoless shore. Take me again to your  
heart as of yore ; Kiss from my forehead  
the furrows of care [ Smooth the few  
silver threads out of my hair ; Over my  
slumbers your loving watch keep — Rock  
me to sleep, mother — rock me to sleep !  
Backward, flow backward, O tide of the  
years! I am so weary of toil and of  
tears — Toil without recompense, tears  
all in vain — Take them, and give me my  
childhood again ! I have frrown weary of  
dust and decay — Weary of fling tng my  
soul wealth away ; Weary of sowing for  
others to reap — Rock me to sleep,  
mother — rock me to sleep ! Tired of the  
hollow, the base, the untrue, Mother, O  
mother, my heart calls for you ; Many a  
summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded our faces between ;  
Met with strong yearning and passionate  
pain. Longing to-night for your presence  
again, Come from the silence so long and  
so deep — Rock me to sleep, mother —  
rock me to sleep 1 Over my heart in the  
days that are flown, No love like  
mother-love ever has shown ; No other  
worship abides and endures — Faithful,  
unselEsh, and patient like yours ; None  
like a mother can charm away pain From  
the sick soul and the world-weary brain.  
Slumbers soft calms o&#x27;er my heavy lips  
creep, Rock me to sleep, mother — rock  
me to sleep 1 Come, let brown hair just  
lighted with gold. Fall on your  
shoulders again as of old ; Let it drop  
over my forehead to-night, Shading my  
faint eyes away from the light ; Fcr  
with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Happy will throng the sweet visions of  
yore ; Lovingly, softly its bright  
billows sweep — Rock me to sleep, mother  
— rock me to sleep ! Mother, dear  
mother, the years have been long Since I  
last listened to your lullaby song ;  
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall  
seem Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a  
dream. Clasped to your heart in a loving  
embrace, With your light breath just  
sweeping my face, Never hereafter to  
wake or to weep — Rock me to sleep,  
mother — rock me to sleep

I am so weary of toil and of tears—  
Toll without recompense, tears all in

I have grown weary of dust end decay-  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away;  
Weary of sowing for others to reap—

Tired of the hollow, the base, the un­

Many a summer tho grass has grown

Blossomed and faded, our faces between:  
Tot, with strong yearning and passionate

Long I to-night for your presence again.  
Tome from the silence so long and bo  
deep—  
Sock me to Bleep, mother—rock me to

Over my heart. In the days that are  
flown.  
No love llko mother-love ever has sh^*;  
No other worship abides and endures—  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the world-weary­  
brain,  
Slumber’s soft calms o’er my heavy lids  
creep;  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to  
sleep!  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted  
with gold.  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old:  
Let it drop over my forehead to-night.  
Shading my faint eyes away from the  
light;  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once  
more  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of  
yore;  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep-  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to  
sleep!  
  
Mother, dear mother, the years have been  
long  
Since I last listened your lullaby song:  
Sing, then, and unto my soul It shall  
seem  
Womanhood’s years have been only a  
dream.  
Clasped to your heart In a loving em­

With your light lashes just sweeping my  
face.  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock mo to
