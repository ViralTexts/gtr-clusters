Backward, turn backward, oh Time, in your flight,  
Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore;  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Backward, flow backward, oh tide of the years!  
I am so weary of toil and of tears—  
Toil without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Take them, and give me my childhood again!  
I have grown weary of dust and decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap,—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, oh mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded, our faces between;  
Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain  
Long I to-night for your presence again;  
Come from the silence so long and so deep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Over my heart, in the days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shown;  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours;  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain;  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calms o&#x27;er my heavy lids creep—  
Rock me to sleep; mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old;  
Let it drop over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light,  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Mother, dear mother! the years have been long  
Since I last listened to your lullaby song;  
Since then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a dream;  
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep,  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!

ROCK S TO SLEEP.  
  
The subjoined poem—weknow not whowrote  
it—is one of the moat,beautiful of it* kind We  
hate ever seen. We do not envy the heart  
which does not thrill to its wild and tender  
music  
Backward, turn backward, oh, Time in your  
night.  
Make me a child again, just for to night!  
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore­  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair­  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of yean!  
I am so weary of toils and of tears­  
Toil without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Take them and give me my childhood again!  
I have grown weary of dust ami decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth awsjr—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep  
  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, oh, mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient, like yours.  
None like a mother can charm away pain,  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calm o&#x27;er my heavy lids creep­  
Rock me to sleep, mothor—-rock me to sleep!  
  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with  
gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old—  
it fall over my forehead to night.  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light—  
For with, its sunay edged shadows once more,  
Hap&#x27;ly will throng the sweet, visions of yore,  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
  
Since I last hushed to your lullaby song

Backward, flow backuTird, 0 tide of the years!  
  
I am so weary of toil and of tears-^  
  
Toil without recompense, tears all in vain—  
  
Take them and give me my childhood agjain!  
  
I have grown weary of dust and decay.  
  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away.  
  
Weary of sowing for others to reap;  
  
Sock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.  
  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue.  
  
Mother, O mo^er, my heart calls for you!  
  
Many a Summer the grass has grown green.  
Blossomed, and faded, our faces betw’cen,  
  
Tet with strong yearning and passionate pain  
Long I to-night for your presence again;  
  
Come from the silence so long and so deep ;  
  
Bock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!  
  
Over my heart in the days that are flown  
No love like mother-love ever has shone—  
  
No other worship abides and endures.  
  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours—  
  
None like a mother can charm away pain.  
  
From the sick soul and world-weary brain ;  
Slumber’s soft cahn o’er my heavy lids creep—  
B^k me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!  
  
Come let your brown hair just lighted with gold.  
Fall on my ehoulders again as of old—  
  
JM it drop over my forehead to-night,  
  
Shying my faint eyes away from the light 1—  
For, with its sunny-edged Madows once more.  
Happily will linger the visions of yore,  
  
Lovingly, softly its bright billows sweep—  
  
Bo^ me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!  
  
Mother, dear mother! the years have been long  
Since last I listened to your lullaby song.  
  
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood’s tears have been only a dream ;  
C^ped to your heart in loving embrace.  
  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face.  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep,

ROCR ME TO SLEEP.  
  
The subjoined poem- we know not who wrote  
it--is one of the most beautiful of its kind we have  
ever seen. We do not envy the heart which does  
not thrill to its wild and tenden music.  
Backward, turn backward, oh, Time in your flight!  
Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from the echolas shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Soothe the few silver threads out of my hair­  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep  
Rock me to sleep, mother--rock me to sleep!  
Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of years!  
I am so weary of toils and of tears­  
Toil without recompense,-tears all in vain­  
Take them and give me my childhood again!  
I have grown weary of dust and decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away­  
Weary of sowing for others to reap;  
Rock me to sleep, mother--rock me to sleep!  
Tired of the hollow, the base the untrue;  
Mother, oh, mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded--our faces between  
Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,  
Long I to-night for your presence again;  
Come from the silence so long and so deep­  
Rock me to sleep, mother--rock me to sleep!  
Over my heart, in days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shown  
No other worship abides and endures,  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours.  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the world weary brain;  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calm o&#x27;er my heavy lids creep  
Rock me to sleep, mother--rock me to sleep!  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old  
Let it fall over my forehead to-night,  
Shielding my faint eyes away from the light  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more,  
Hap&#x27;ly will throng the sweet visions of yore,  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep  
Rock me to sleep, mother--rock me to sleep!

Klee from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair—  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of years !  
I am so weary of toils and of tears—  
Toll without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Bkke them and give me my childhood again 1  
I have grown weary of dust and decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap :  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep 1  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, oh, mother, ihy heart calls for you !  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded—our faces between—  
Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,  
Long I to-night for your presence again :  
Coma from the silence so long and so deep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep 1  
Over my heart in days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shone—  
No other worship abides and endures,  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient, like yours.  
None like a mother can charm away pain,  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain :  
Blnmher’s soft calm o’er my heavy lids creep—  
Bock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep !  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold.  
Fall on your shoulders again us of old—  
Let it fall over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light—  
J‘ or with its sunny-edged shadows once more,  
Hap’ly will throng the sweet visions of yore,  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
Book me to sleep, mother—rook me to sleep 1  
Mother, dear mother ! the years have been long  
Bioee last I hushed to your lullaby song,  
Sing then, and unto my sou! it shall seem  
Wemanhood’* years have been hut a dream ;  
Clasp to your arms in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face,  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep—

The subjoined poem—written by a ‘‘jour’’ prin­  
ter named Lawrence—is one of the most beauti­  
ful of its kind wo have ever seen. We do not  
envy the heart which docs not thrill to its wild  
and tender music:  
Backward, turn backward, oh, Time in your flight,  
Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Take me again to your heart ns of yore—  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair—  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
Backward, flow backward, oh tide of years!  
I am so weary of toils and of tears—  
Toil without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Take them and give me my childhood again!  
Weary of flinging my soul wealth away—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap;  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
.Mother, oh, mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green.  
Blossomed and faded—our faces between—  
Vet with strong yearning and passionate pain;  
Long I to-night for your presence again;  
Come (loin the silence so long and so deep   
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
Over my heart in days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever shone—  
No other worship abides and endures,  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours,  
None like a mother can charm away pain;  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain,  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calm o’er my heavy lids creep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old—  
Let it fall over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light   
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more,  
Happily will through the sweet visions of yore,  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
Mother, dear mother! the years have been long  
Since last I hushed to your lullaby song—  
Sing then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been but a dream;  
Clasp to your arms in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face,  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep.

Backward, turn backward, O, Time, in yourflight,

Rock Me to Sleep. Backward, turn

a child again just for to-night! Mother  
come back from the echoless shore, Take  
me again to your heart as of yore; Kiss  
from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my  
hair; Over my slumbers your loving watch  
keep; Rock me to sleep, mother-rock me  
to sleep! Backward, flow backward. O  
tide of the years ! I am so weary of  
toil and of tearsToil without  
recompense, tears all in vainSTake them,  
and give me my childhood again! I have  
grown weary of dust and decayWeary of

sowing for others to reap; Rock me to
