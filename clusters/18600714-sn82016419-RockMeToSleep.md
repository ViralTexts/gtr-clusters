Backward, turn backward, oh Time, in your flight,  
Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore;  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Backward, flow backward, oh tide of the years!  
I am so weary of toil and of tears—  
Toil without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Take them, and give me my childhood again!  
I have grown weary of dust and decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap,—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, oh mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded, our faces between;  
Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain  
Long I to-night for your presence again;  
Come from the silence so long and so deep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Over my heart, in the days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shown;  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours;  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain;  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calms o&#x27;er my heavy lids creep—  
Rock me to sleep; mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old;  
Let it drop over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light,  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Mother, dear mother! the years have been long  
Since I last listened to your lullaby song;  
Since then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a dream;  
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep,  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!

Tired of the hollo, the baae, the untrue,

Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded our faces between

Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep !  
Over my heart in days that are flown,  
No love like mother love everhaä shown  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithfal, unselfish, and patient, like yours,  
None like a mother can charm awa) pain  
From the sick soul and world-weary brain ;

Rock me to sleep, mother rock mc to sleep !  
Come, let your brawn hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as of old  
Let it fall over my forehead to-night,  
Shading ray faint cye3 away from the light  
For with its fubiij edged shadows once more,  
Hipp &#x27;ly, will throng the sweet visions of your,  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows fwccjj  
Rock me to sleep, mother rock me to sleep !  
Mother, dear mother, the years have been long  
Since I last hushed to your lullaby song  
Sing then, and unto my soul it shall ecm  
Womanhood&#x27; years have been but a dream ;  
Clasp to your arms in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face,  
Never hereafter to wake cr to weep

BackwarbD, turn backward, oh, Time, in your flight !  
  
Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore—  
  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair—  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of years!  
IT am so weary of toils and of tears—  
  
Toil without recompense—tears all in vain—  
Take them, and give me my childhood again!  
I have grown weary of dust and decay,  
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away—  
Weary of sowing for others to reap;  
  
Rock me to sleep, motlcr—rock me to sleep  
  
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,  
Mother, oh, mother, my heart calls for you!  
Many a summer tlie grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded—our faces between—  
Yet with strong yearnings and passionate pain,  
Long I to-night for your presence again ;  
Come from the silence so long and so deep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
  
  
Over my heart, in days that are flown,  
  
No love like motlicr-love ever has shown—  
No other worship abides and endures,  
Faithfal, unselfish, and patient, like yours.  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain  
Slumber’s soft calm o’er my heavy lids creep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,  
Fall on your shoulders again as’of old—  
  
Let it fall over my forehead to-night,  
  
Shielding my faint eyes away from the light—  
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more,  
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore,  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!  
  
Mother, dear mother! the years have been long  
Since I last hushed to your lullaby song—  
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood’s years have been but a dream;  
Clasp to your arms in loving embrace,

Never hereafter to wake or to weep—

Many a summer the grass has grown green,  
Blossomed and faded, our faces between,  
Yet, with strong yearning and passionate  
pain,  
Long I to-night for your presence again.  
Come from the silence so long and so deep,—  
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.  
  
Over my heart, in the days that are flown,  
No love like mother-love ever has shone  
No other worship abides and endures  
Faithful, unselfish, and patient, like yours  
None like a mother can charm away pain  
From the sick soul and the worid-weary  
brain.  
Slumber&#x27;s soft calms o&#x27;er my heavy lids  
creep,  
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

bad long refused to flow. My voice was  
very unsteady as 1 began the last verse:  
&quot;Mother, dear mother, the years have been  
long  
Since 1 last listened thy lullaby song:  
Sin; then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been ouly a dream.  
Clasped to thine arms In a leving embrace,  
I

I  
With thy light lashes just sweeping my face,  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep.  
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

Mother, dear mother, the years have been

Since I last listened to your lullaby song :  
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a  
dream ;  
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my

Never hereafter to wake or to weep  
Rook me to sleep, mother rock me to

Make me a child again, just for to-night!  
Mother, come back from that echoless shore,  
Take me again to your heart as of yore;  
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,  
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;  
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;

No love like mother love ever has shone;

Slumber’s soft calms o’er my heavy lids

Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!  
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with

Fall on your shoulders again, as of old;  
Let it drop over my forehead to-night,  
Shading my faint eyes away from the light:  
For with its sunny edged shadows once more,

For with its sunny-edged shadows once more  
Happy will throng the sweet visions of yore—  
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep—  
Bock me to sleep, n.

Mother, dear mother, the years have been  
lonar  
Since I last listened to your lullaby song  
Sing, then, and unto my heart it shall seem  
Womanhood&#x27;s years have been only a dream  
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,  
With your light lashes just sweeping my face,  
Never hereafter to wake or to weep—  
Rock me to sleep, mother—rock me to sleep!
