t he wrote the Epitaph in 1728 seems the most acceptable.  
Whether the concept of the Epitaph, comparing a printer’s body to an old book, was original with Franklin has also been the subject of discussion and inquiry. He has been charged with plagiarizing a Latin epitaph on Jacob Tonson that was printed in the Gentleman’s Magazine in 1736. This charge is without foundation, of course, if Franklin composed his Epitaph in 1728. But he could have seen other applications of the simile, not uncommon in his day, such as Benjamin Woodbridge’s epitaph on John Cotton, printed in Mather’s Magnalia Christi Americana (1702).

following well-known epitaph of Dr. Ben­  
jamin Franklin, written by himself, will  
bear repetition here lor its humor and  
quaintness :  
The Body of  
Benjamin Franklin,  
Printer,  
(Like the cover of an old book,  
Its contents torn out,  
And stript of its lettering and guilding)  
Lies here, food for worms;  
But the work shall not be lost,  
For it will (as he believes) appear once more  
In a new and elegant edition.  
Revised and corrected by  
The Author
