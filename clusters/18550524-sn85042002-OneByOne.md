One by one the sands are flowing,

Some are coming, some are going,

One by one (bright gifts from Heaven,)

Ready, too, to let them go.  
  
One by one thy griefs shall meet thee,  
Do not fear an armed band;  
One will fade as others greet thee,  
Shadows passing through the land.  
  
Do not look at life&#x27;s long sorrow;  
See how small each movement&#x27;s pain;  
God will help thee for to-morrow:  
Every day begin again.  
  
Every hour that fleets so slowly,  
Has its task to do or bear;  
Luminous the crown, and holy,  
If thou set each gem with care.  
  
Do not linger with regretting,  
Or for passion hours despond;  
Nor, the daily toil forgetting,  
Look too eagerly beyond.  
  
Hours are golden links, God&#x27;s token,  
Reaching Heaven; but one by one,  
Take them lest the chain be broken
