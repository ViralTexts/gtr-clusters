One by one the sands are flowing,  
One by one the moments fall;  
Some are coming, some are going,  
Do not strive to grasp them all.  
  
One by one thy duties wait thee,  
Let the whole strength go to each,  
Let not future dreams elate thee,  
Learn thou first what these can teach.  
  
One by one (bright gifts from Heaven,)  
Joys are sent thee here below;  
Take them readily when given,  
Ready, too, to let them go.  
  
One by one thy griefs shall meet thee,  
Do not fear an armed band;  
One will fade as others greet thee,  
Shadows passing through the land.  
  
Do not look at life&#x27;s long sorrow;  
See how small each movement&#x27;s pain;  
God will help thee for to-morrow:  
Every day begin again.  
  
Every hour that fleets so slowly,  
Has its task to do or bear;  
Luminous the crown, and holy,  
If thou set each gem with care.  
  
Do not linger with regretting,  
Or for passion hours despond;  
Nor, the daily toil forgetting,  
Look too eagerly beyond.  
  
Hours are golden links, God&#x27;s token,  
Reaching Heaven; but one by one,  
Take them lest the chain be broken  
Ere the pilgrimage be done.
