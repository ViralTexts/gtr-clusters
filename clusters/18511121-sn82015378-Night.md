The day is done, and the darkness  
Falls from the wings of night,  
As a feather is wafted downward  
From an eagle in his flight.  
  
I see the lights of the village  
Gleam through the rain and the mist,  
And a feeling of sadness comes o&#x27;er me,  
That my soul cannot resist—  
  
A feeling of sadness and longing,  
That is not akin to pain,  
And resembles sorrow only

Come, read to me some poem,  
Some noble and heartfelt lay,  
That shall soothe this restless feeling,  
And banish the thoughts of day.  
  
Not from the bards sublime,  
Not from the bards sublime,  
Whose distant footsteps echo  
Through the corridors of time.  
  
For, like strains of material music,  
Their mighty thoughts suggest  
Life&#x27;s endless toil and endeavor;  
And to night I long for rest.  
  
Read from some humble poet,  
Whose songs gush from his heart  
As showers from the clouds of summer,  
Or tears from the eye-lids start.  
  
Who through longs days of labor,  
And nights devoid of ease,  
Still heard in his soul the music  
Of wonderful melodies.  
  
Such songs have power to quiet  
The restless pulse of care,  
And come like the benediction  
That follow after prayer.  
  
Then read from the treasured volume  
This poem of thy choice,  
And lend to the rhyme of the poet  
The beauty of thy voice.  
  
And the night shall be filled with music  
And the cares that infest the day  
Shall fold up their tents like the Arabs,  
And silently pass away.

Poetry.  
  
THE DAY IS DONE.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The day is done, and the darkness  
Falls from the wings of night,  
As a feather is wafted down ward  
  
From an eagle in its flight.  
  
I see the lighte of the village  
Gleam through the rain and the mist,  
And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me.  
That my heart cannot resist—  
  
A feeling of sadness and longing  
That is not akin to pain,  
  
But resembles sorrow only  
As the mist resembles the rain.  
  
Come read to me come poem,  
Some simple and heartfelt lay,  
  
That shall soothe this restless feeling,  
And banish the thoughts of day.  
  
Wot from the grand old masters,  
Not from the bards sublime,  
  
Whose distant footsteps echo  
Through the corridors of Time;  
  
¥or like strains of martial music,  
Their mighty thoughts suggest  
  
Life’s endless toil and endeavor;  
And to-night I long for rest.  
  
Read from some humble poet,  
Whose songs gush from his heart  
  
As showers from the clouds of summer,  
Or tears from the eyelids start;  
  
Who throngh long days of labor,  
And nights devoid of ease,  
  
Still heard in his soul the music  
Of wonderful melodies.  
  
Such songs have power to quiet  
The restless pulse of care,  
  
And come like the benediction  
That follows after prayer.  
  
Then read from the treasured volume  
The poem of thy choice,  
  
And lend to the rhyme of the poet,  
The beauty of thy voice.  
  
And the night shall be filled with music,  
And the cares that infest the day  
Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,  
  
And as silently steal away.  
—H, W. Longfellow.

From an eagle in his flight.

Gleam through the rain and the mist,

Not from the grand old masters,  
Not from the bards sublime,  
Whose distant footsteps echo  
Through the com&#x27;dors of Time.

Whoe songs gushed from his heart,  
As showers from the clouds iu summer,  
Or tears from the eyelids start;  
Who, through long days of labor,  
And nights devoted to eae,  
Still heard iu his oul the music  
Of wonderful mt todies.

The restless pulse of care,

therein,  
Sees the heavens all black with sin, —  
Sees not its depths, nor bounds.  
  
Longfellow.  
  
** « Athwart the swinging branches cast,  
Soft rays of sunshine pour ;  
Then comes the fearful wintry blast ;  
Our hopes, like withered leaves, fall fast ;  
Pallid lips say, ‘‘ It is past !  
We can return no more!”  
  
** * Look then into thine own heart, and write !  
Yes, into Life’s deep stream !  
All ferms of sorrow and delight,  
All solemn Voices of the Night,  
That can soothe thee, or affright,—  
Be these henceforth thy theme.’ ”  
  
So he wrote in this thirty-second  
year, by way of prelude to his first  
volume of poems, ‘Voices of the  
Night.’ And he did look into his own  
heart, and wrote what he found there.  
But he found there soft rays of sun-  
shine, and holy thoughts like stars,  
rather than withered leaves, and heavens  
black with sin; the forms that came  
to him were those of delight rather  
than sorrow ; the voices he heard had  
more power to soothe than affright.  
Such sorrow as his verse expresses is  
of that kind that softens and refines  
the heart, not wrings or crushes it.  
No one, indeed, could better describe  
the charm of his verse than he himself  
has.  
  
** Come read to me some poem,  
Some simple and heartfelt lay,  
That shall soothe this restless feeling,  
And banish the thoughts of day.  
  
** Not from the grand old masters,  
Not from the bards sublime,

It is this tender restful charm which

Poetry. The Day 1h Done. The day Is  
done, and the darkness Falls from tbe  
winga of Night, Ae a feather is wafted  
downward j From d% eagle in his flight,  
| I eee the lights of the village Gleam  
through the rain and the mist, Aud a  
feeling of Badness comes o*er me, That  
mysoul cannot resist: A feeling of  
Badness and longing, That is not akin to  
pain, And resembles eorrotv onle. As the  
miBt resembles the rain; Come! read to  
me some poem — Some simp&#x27;e and heartfelt  
lay, Tbat ehall »oo the this restless  
feeling, And banish the thoughts of day.  
Not from the grand old masters, Not from  
tbe bards sublime, Whose distant  
footsteps echo Through the corridors of  
Time ; For, like strains of martial  
music, Their mighty thoughts suggest  
Life&#x27;s endless toil and endeavour ; And  
to-night I long for rest, Bead from some  
humbler poet, Whose songs gushed from  
his heart, as snowersrrom tne cjouas oi  
summer, Or tears from the eyelids start  
; Who, through long day6 of labour, And  
nights devoid of ease, Still beard in  
his soul tbe music Of wonderful  
melodies. Such songs bare power to quiet  
The restless pulse of CAre, And come  
like the benediction Tbat follows after  
prayer. Then read frpm the treasured  
volume &#x27; The poem of tby choice, And  
lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty  
of thy voice. Aod the night shall be  
filled with music, And the caree tbat  
infest the day Shall fold tbeir tents,  
like the Arabs, And as silently ateQl  
away. Longfellow.

The day is done, and the darkness  
Falls from the wings of Night,  
  
As a feather is wafted downward  
From an eagle in his flight.  
  
I see the lights of the village  
Gleam through the rain and the mist,  
And a fecling of sadness comes o’er me  
That my soul cannot resist !  
  
A feeling of sadness and longing,  
That is not akin to pain,  
  
And resembles sorrow only  
As the mist resembles the rain.  
  
Come, read to me some poem,  
Some simple and heartfelt lay,  
That shall soothe this restless feeling,  
And banish the thoughts of day.  
  
Not from the grand old masters,  
Not from the bards sublime,  
  
Whose distant footsteps echo  
Through the corridors of Time:

Life’s endless toil and endeavor ;  
And to-night I long for rest.  
  
Read from some humbler poet,  
Whose songs gushed from his heart  
As showers from the clouds of summer,  
Or tears from the eyelids start ;  
  
Who, through long days of labor,  
And nights devoid of ease,  
Still heard in his soul the music
