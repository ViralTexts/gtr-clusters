The day is done, and the darkness  
Falls from the wings of night,  
As a feather is wafted downward  
From an eagle in his flight.  
  
I see the lights of the village  
Gleam through the rain and the mist,  
And a feeling of sadness comes o&#x27;er me,  
That my soul cannot resist—  
  
A feeling of sadness and longing,  
That is not akin to pain,  
And resembles sorrow only  
As the mist resembles the rain.  
  
Come, read to me some poem,  
Some noble and heartfelt lay,  
That shall soothe this restless feeling,  
And banish the thoughts of day.  
  
Not from the bards sublime,  
Not from the bards sublime,  
Whose distant footsteps echo  
Through the corridors of time.  
  
For, like strains of material music,  
Their mighty thoughts suggest  
Life&#x27;s endless toil and endeavor;  
And to night I long for rest.  
  
Read from some humble poet,  
Whose songs gush from his heart  
As showers from the clouds of summer,  
Or tears from the eye-lids start.  
  
Who through longs days of labor,  
And nights devoid of ease,  
Still heard in his soul the music  
Of wonderful melodies.  
  
Such songs have power to quiet  
The restless pulse of care,  
And come like the benediction  
That follow after prayer.  
  
Then read from the treasured volume  
This poem of thy choice,  
And lend to the rhyme of the poet  
The beauty of thy voice.  
  
And the night shall be filled with music  
And the cares that infest the day  
Shall fold up their tents like the Arabs,  
And silently pass away.

Gleam throygh the rain and the mist,

Gleam through the rain and the mint.

But he found there soft rays of sun-  
shine, and holy thoughts like stars,  
rather than withered leaves, and heavens  
black with sin; the forms that came  
to him were those of delight rather  
than sorrow ; the voices he heard had  
more power to soothe than affright.  
Such sorrow as his verse expresses is  
of that kind that softens and refines  
the heart, not wrings or crushes it.

the charm of his verse than he himself

“The deed is done and Odd Volumes  
Descend from their dizzy heights,  
As a feather is wafted downward,  
Like an eagle in its flight.  
“X see the ‘Flashlights of the Century,’  
Gleam through the season’s list,  
And a feeling of gladness comes o’er me.  
That my soul cannot resist.  
■*A feeling of gladness because of  
A winter not spent in vain.  
&quot;Which resembles satisfaction,  
As the mist resembles the rain.”

Not a moment fpr restless feelings,

Though she talk of &#x27;Peace Sublime,’  
Nor from Mrs. Robottom an echo.

The day is done, and the darkness  
Falls from the wings of Night,  
  
As a feather is wafted downward  
From an eagle in his flight.  
  
I see the lights of the village  
Gleam through the rain and the mist,  
And a fecling of sadness comes o’er me  
That my soul cannot resist !  
  
A feeling of sadness and longing,  
That is not akin to pain,  
  
And resembles sorrow only  
As the mist resembles the rain.  
  
Come, read to me some poem,  
Some simple and heartfelt lay,  
That shall soothe this restless feeling,  
And banish the thoughts of day.  
  
Not from the grand old masters,  
Not from the bards sublime,  
  
Whose distant footsteps echo  
Through the corridors of Time:  
  
For, like strains of martial music,  
Their mighty thoughts suggest  
  
Life’s endless toil and endeavor ;  
And to-night I long for rest.  
  
Read from some humbler poet,  
Whose songs gushed from his heart  
As showers from the clouds of summer,  
Or tears from the eyelids start ;  
  
Who, through long days of labor,  
And nights devoid of ease,  
Still heard in his soul the music  
  
  
  
Of wonderful melodies.

Such songs have power to quiet  
The restless pulse of care,  
  
And come like the benediction  
That follows after prayer.  
  
Then read from the treasured volume  
The poem of thy choice, .  
  
And lend to the rhyme of the poet  
The beauty of thy voice.  
  
And the night shall be filled with music,  
And the cares, that infest the day,  
Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,  
And as silently steal away

some one skilled in the treatment of diseases,  
or as an opportunity for forcing on men’s  
minds and hearts the cares and difficulties  
of which they are already tired and sick.  
The average American is not disposed on  
Thanksgiving morning to give himself up to  
an elaborate argument in favor of or against  
any State or national policy or idea. He  
feels more like saying:  
“Come, read to me some poem,
