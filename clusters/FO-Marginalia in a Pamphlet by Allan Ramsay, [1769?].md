“the frivolousness of the vulgar notion that the people of England keep the possession of their own purses, and give their consent to their own taxation by their representatives,” suppose that the Commons, Lords, and even the King were elected every seven years by all the men of England: still “they would be taxed without their own consent, as much as if they lived under the great Turk. … This supposed representation, even with regard to the House of Commons, is very far from being true, and … the word Virtual, which has been clapped in, to supply this defect, has no meaning at all.” The history of the evolution of Parliament proves that an elected member represents only his own constituency. He votes, however, to tax people all over the c

money. There are now ten 40–shilling freeholders for one in the time of Henry VI. “But although these are legal voters by the letter of  
  
The ancient Constitution was previous to this Act: and by that all had a Right to vote.  
the law, they are not so by the spirit of the ancient constitution, which plainly intended to lop off nine out of ten of them. …” In addition there are “the  
  
Why have not the Copyholders a Vote? As to those who hold no Lands, they in fact never pay any Taxes in reality, but in appearance only. You may if you please make a Law that all the Taxes necessary for the Service of the State shall be paid by the Labourers only. This would not affect the Labourers. Suppose by such a Law each Labourer who receives but 12d. a Day should be taxed £5. The Effect would only be that he must thenceforth have £5 1s. for a Days Labour paid by his Employer. Taxes must be paid out of the Produce of the Land. There is no other possible Fund. Therefore the Consent of Landholders is only necessary. Merchants, Manufacturers, &amp;c. pay no taxes really, but only apparently: For they rate their Goods in Proportion to the Consumers.  
labourers, the farmers, and even the copy-holders of land, who have no vote in chusing those who impose taxes on them.”  
  
All Quibble. If the Grand Seignior is sole Landlord he pays all Taxes out of his Rents, for the greater his Tax the less he can otherwise receive of his Tenants, Since the Produce of the Earth is the only Source of Revenue. So it is by his own Consent that he taxes himself.  
Virtual representation, as a principle of government, means that those elected, whatever their number, represent the whole. But suppose that all the land is held by a single freeholder, as in Turkey. “Then is the Grand Signor virtual representative of all the people of Turkey, their universal knight of the shire, and, in a most parliamentary manner, levies what taxes he pleases upon them, by their own consent.”  
  
A most impudent Assertion!  
I have begun by showing that the idea of a people’s consenting to be taxed “is contrary to the nature of government, and unsupported by any fact.  
  
A Scotchman by this Phrase.  
I have been at pains to shew that the notion of the legislative power acting by virtue of representation,  
  
How comes it then, that the Commons only, who are chosen by the People, grant Money, and lay Taxes?  
is no principle in the British constitution; and I have  
  
They would once have us Americans satisfy’d with this Notion of virtual Representation: But having made them asham’d of it, they now tell us there is no such thing in the British Constitution as Representation at all!

The separation of Britain and her “American appertinencies” would destroy the prosperity and liberty of both. Until “New England is strong enough to protect Old England, and the seat of the British empire is transferred from London to Boston, there is an absolute necessity that the right of giving law to America should continue to be vested in Great Britain. That it is the interest of Great Britain to protect and cherish her American provinces instead of oppressing them, is an undeniable truth; and it is, perhaps, no less true, that some farther attention, and some farther means of communication, are still wanting to that desirable end: but let every true friend to Britain and to all her connexions stand forth in defence of her great legislative uncountroulable power, without which no union, and of course no safety, can be expected.”

Brivain, That it is the intereft of Great  
Britain to proteét and cherith her American  
provinces inftead of oppreffing them, is an  
undeniable truth ; and it is, perhaps, no lefs  
true, that fome farther attention, and fome  
farther means of communication, are ftill  
wanting to that defirable end : but let every  
true friend to Britain and to all her connex-  
ions, ftand forth in defence of her great !e-  
giflative uncontroulable power, without  
which no union, and of courfe no fafety, can  
be expe4ed. X.

_ To thofe who are not converfant in th:

Text.—I pass over the labourers, the farmers and even the  
copy-holders of land who have no vote in choosing those who  
impose taxes upon them.  
  
Note-—Why have not the copy-holders a vote? As to those  
who hold no land, they in fact never pay any taxes in reality,  
but in appearance only. You may, if you please, make a law  
that all the taxes necessary for the service of the state shalk be  
paid by the labourer only. This would not affect the labourers.  
Suppose by such a law each labourer who receives but 12d a day  
should be taxed 54. The effect would only be that he must  
thenceforth have 5/2 ls for a day’s labour paid by his employer.  
Taxes must be paid out of the produce of the land. There is no  
other possible fund; therefore, the consent of land-holders is only  
necessary— Merchants, Manufacturers, &amp;c. pay no taxes really,  
but only apparently, for they rate their goods in proportion to the  
consumers.

Note.—If the Grand Seignior is sole landlord he pays all taxes  
out of his rents, for the greater the tax the less he can otherwise  
receive of his tenants. Since the produce of the earth is the  
only source of revenue, so is it by his own consent he taxes him-  
self.  
  
Text.—The notion of people consenting to their own taxation  
is contrary to the nature of government.  
  
NVote-—A most impudent assertion.  
  
Text.—I have shown that the notion of the legislative power  
acting by virtue of representation, is no princifile in the British  
constitution.  
  
Note—How comes it then, that the commons only, who are  
chosen by the people, grant monies and lay taxes?  
  
Text.—lI have finished by showing that the words virtual re-  
fresentation mean nothing at all.  
  
Note.—They would at once have us Americans satisfied with  
this notion of virtual refiresentation; but having made them  
ashamed of it, they now tell us there is no such thing in the  
British constitution as representation at all.
