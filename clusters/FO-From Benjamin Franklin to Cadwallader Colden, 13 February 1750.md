I receiv’d your very kind Letter relating to my Proposals for the Education of our Youth, and return you the Thanks of the Gentlemen concern’d, for the useful Hints you have favour’d us with. It was long doubtful whether the Academy would be fix’d in the Town or Country; but a Majority of those from whose generous Subscriptions we expected to be able to carry the Scheme into Execution, being strongly for the Town, it was at last fix’d to be there. And we have for the purpose made an advantageous Purchase of the Building which was erected for itinerant Preaching; a House 100 foot long and 70 wide, with a large Lot of Ground, capable of additional Buildings; situate in an airy Part of the Town. It cost I suppose not less than £2000 Building; but we have it for less than half the Money. It is strongly built of Brick; and we are now about dividing it into Rooms for the Academy. The Subscription goes on with great Success; and will not I believe be much short of £5000, besides what we expect from the Proprietors. From our Government we expect nothing. Enclos’d I send you a Copy of our present Constitutions; but we are to have a Charter, and then such of the Constitutions as are found good on Experience will I suppose be enacted into Laws, and others amended, &amp;c.  
In this Affair, as well as in other publick Affairs I have been engag’d in, the Labouring Oar has lain and does lay very much upon m

I have no Observations of Jupiter’s Satellites to send you, as I expected I should have. Being my self otherwise engag’d, and not very skilful in those Matters, I depended on our Astronomer Mr. Godfrey, and put the Telescope into his Hands for that purpose: He had a fine Summer for it, but I am inform’d was so continually muddled with Drink, that our Surveyor General, Mr. Scull, who was his Neighbour, could never get him to assist in making the Meridian Line. He is now dead, and your Letter of Directions for making such a Line, which I put into his Hands, is lost. Mr. Scull desires me to write to you for a Repetition of those Directions, and when you have a little Leisure, I shall be oblig’d to you for them: But it will now be Midsummer before we shall have an Opportunity of observing Jupiter again.  
I have wrote some additional Papers on Electricity, which I will get copied, and send to you per next Post. They go on much slower in those Discoveries at home, than might be expected.  
I am glad you are about enlarging and explaining your Principles of Natural Philosophy: I believe the Work will be well receiv’d by the Learned World.

on a  
large lot of ground, capable of receiving more buildings to  
lodge the scholars, if it should come to be a regular college.  
The house is one hundred feet long and seventy wide, built  
of brick, very strong, and sufficiently high for three lofty  
stories. I suppose the building did not cost less than 20002;  
but we bought it for 7751. 18s. 113d. though it will cost us  
three, perhaps four hundred more to make the partitions and  
floors, and fit up the rooms. I send you enclosed a copy of

Philadelphia, Feb. 13th, 1749-50.  
  
Sir,—I sasnived your very kind letter, relating to my propo-  
sals for the education of our youth, and return you the thanks of the  
gentlemen concerned, for the useful hints you have favoured us with.  
It was long doubtful, whether the academy would be fixed in the town  
or country; but a majority of those, from whose generous subscrip-  
tions we expected to be able to carry the scheme into execution, being  
strongly for the town, it was at last fixed to be there. And we have,  
for the purpose, made an advantageous purchase of the building  
which was erected for itinerant preaching: a house one hundred  
feet long, and seventy wide, with ‘a large lot of ground, capable of  
additional buildings, situate in an airy part of the town. It cost, I  
suppose, not less than £2000 building: but we have it for less than  
half the money. It is strongly built of brick; and we are now about  
dividing it into rooms for the academy. The subscription goes on  
with great success, and will not, I believe, be much short of £5000,  
besides what we expect from the proprietors. From our government  
we expect nothing. Enclosed I send you a copy of our present con-  
stitutions; but we are to have a charter, and then such of the consti-  
  
tutions as are found good by experience will, I suppose, be enacted  
into laws, and others amended, &amp;c,  
In thie affhir, as well as in other public affhirs F have been engaged  
in, the labouring oar has lain and does lie very much upon me
