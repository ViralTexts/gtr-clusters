The Strange Light  
Hydrographical Office, March 10,1843.  
On Monday morning, the 6th, our attention was called to a paragraph in the newspapers stating that a comet was visible near the sun at mid-day with that naked eye. The sky was clear; but, not being able to discover anything with the unassisted eye, recourse was had to a telescope, without any better success. About sunset in the evening the examination was renewed with great diligence, but to no purpose. As the stars began to peep out, observers were multiplied. Capella, Rigil, Beta (B) in the Bull, Delta in Orion, and Alpha (A) in the Hare, came to the meridian, and their transits were marked by one observer; while another, with close attention, watched through the fading light of the western horizon for the Comet and its tail. The last faint streak of day gilded the west, beautiful and delicate fleeces of zonder cloud cloud curtained the bed of the sun, the upper sky was studded with stars, and all hoped of seeing the Comet that evening had vanished.   
Soon after we had retired, the officer of the watch announced the appearance of the Comet in the west. The phenomenon was sublime and beautiful. The needle was greatly agitated; and a strongly marked pencil of light was streaming up from the path of the sun in an oblique direction to the southward and eastward; its edges were parallel. It was about 1 deg. 30 min broad and 30 deg. long. Stars could be seen twinkling through it, and no doubt was at first entertained but that this was the tail of the Comet. The officer of the watch was directed to search the eastern sky with the telescope in the morning, from early dawn, and before, till sunrise. Nothing strange or uncommon was noted by him.  
Tuesday was a beautiful day; the air was still and the sky clear. With the aid of the telescopes, a regular and systematic examination of the heavens was commenced. Every point of space within 15 deg. of the sun, in all directions, was passed and repassed over and over again, through the field of the telescopes, and minutely examined, in the hope of discovering the Comet itself. The entire day was occupied in thus exploring that portion of the heavens.  In the afternoon a black spot, in shape not unlike a liberty cap, was discovered in the sun. But the day was fast declining, and with the fading light of evening the interest was too intense to turn away from the telescope for other and more exact observations upon this spot.   
The sun was clear, gilding, as it sunk below the hills, a narrow streak of wane cloud, seen through the tree-tops beyond the Potomac.  
The tail had appeared of great length for the first time the evening before; therefore we expected to find its length this evening greatly increased. It was a moment of intense interest when the first stars began to appear. The last rays of the sun still lingered on the horizon; and at this moment, just about the region of the upper crepusculum, a well-defined pencil of hairy light, was seen pointing towards the Sun. At 5h. 41m. sidereal time, the first measurement of length of the tail was taken it measured 41 deg. to the horizon. At 6h. 19m. it had become moat distinct. It was then 1 deg. 45m. broad, and 55 deg. long, not including the part below the horizon, which, supposing its terminus to be near the sun, could not, owing to the oblique angle which it made with the horizon, be less than 10 or 15 degrees more.  It now commenced gradually to fade away, and in a short time had entirely disappeared. Tho morning observations were diligently renewed, but nothing could be seen worthy of note.

The Strange Light.  
Hgoaoouaraicat Orricz, March lo, 126.  
On Monday morning, the 6th, our attention was  
called to a puragraph in the newspapers stating  
that a Conar was visible near the sun at mid-day  
a with the naked eye. The sky was clear; but, not  
being able to discoverany thing with the unassisted  
sye, recourse was had to a telescope, without any  
better success. About sunset in the evening the  
examination was renewed with great diligence, but  
to no purpose. As the stars began to peep oul,  
observers were muliplied. Capella, Rigil, Beta  
(B) in the Bull, Delta in Orion, and Aipha (A) in  
the Hare, came to the meridian, and their transits  
were marked by one observer; while another, with  
close attention, watched through the fading light  
of the western horizon for the Comet and its tail.  
The last faint streak of day gilded the west, bean­  
tiful and delicate fleeces of sonder cloud curtained  
the bed of the sun, ths upper sky was studded  
with stars, and all hopes of seeing the Comet that  
evening had vanished.  
Soon after we had retired, the officer of the watch  
announced the appearance of the Comet in the  
west. The phenomenon was sublime and beautie  
ful. The needle was greatly agitated; and a  
strongly marked pencil of light was streaming up  
from the path of the sun in an oblique direction  
to the southward and eastward; its edges were  
paraliel. It was about I deg. 30 min brond and  
30 deg, long. Stars could be seen twinkling  
through it, and no doubt was at first entertained  
but that this was the tail of the Comet. The ofh-  
cer of the watch was directed to search the eastern

apot, in shape not unlike a liberty cap, was dise­

cation from the Hydrographical Office in that  
city:—‘*On Monday morning, March 6th, our  
attention was called to a paragraph in the news-  
papers, stating that a comet was visible near the  
sun at mid-day with the naked eye. The sky  
was clear, but, not being able to discover any  
thing with the unassisted eye, resource was had  
to a telescope, without any better success. About  
Sunset in the evening, the examination was re-  
newed with great diligence, but to no purpose.  
The last faint streak of day gilded the west,  
beautiful and delicate fleeces of cloud curtained  
the bed of the sun, the upper sky was studded  
with stars, and all hopes of seeing the comet that  
evening had vanished. Soon after we had re-  
tired, the officer of the watch announced the  
appearance of the comet in the west. The phe-  
nomenon was sublime and beautiful. The needle  
wes greatly agitated; and a strongly marked  
pencil of light was streaming up from the path  
of the sun, in an oblique direction, to the south-  
ward and eastward; its edges were parallel. It  
was 1° 30’ broad, and 80° long. Stars could be  
Seen twinkling through it, and no doubt was at  
first entertained but that this was the tail of the  
Comet. The officer of the watch was directed to  
search the eastern sky with the telescope in the  
morning, from early dawn and before, till sun-  
rise. Nothing strange or uncommon was noted  
by him. Tuesday was a beautiful day. The sun  
vas clear, gilding, as it sunk below the hills, a  
harrow streak of cloud, seen through the tree-  
  
  
  
tops beyond the Potomac. The tail had appeared  
of great length for the first time the evening be-  
fore; therefore, we expected to find its length  
this evening greatly increased. It was a moment  
of intense interest when the first stars began tc  
appear. The last rays of the sun still lingered  
on the horizon, and at this moment a well-defined  
pencil of hairy light was seen pointing toward  
the sun. At 5h. 41 m., siderial time, the first  
measurement of length of the tail was taken; it  
measured 41° to the horizon. At 6h. 19 m. it  
had become most distinct. It was then 1° 45/  
broad, and 55° long, not including the part below  
the horizon, which, supposing its terminus to be  
near the sun, could not, owing to the oblique  
angle which it made with the horizon, be less  
than 10° or 165° more. It now commenced  
gradually to fade away, and in a short time had  
entirely disappeared. The morning observa-  
tions were diligently renewed, but nothing could  
be seen worthy of note.”’ A letter, dated Marc
