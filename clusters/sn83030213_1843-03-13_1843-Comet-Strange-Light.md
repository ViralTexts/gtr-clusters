The Strange Light  
Hydrographical Office, March 10,1843.  
On Monday morning, the 6th, our attention was called to a paragraph in the newspapers stating that a comet was visible near the sun at mid-day with that naked eye. The sky was clear; but, not being able to discover anything with the unassisted eye, recourse was had to a telescope, without any better success. About sunset in the evening the examination was renewed with great diligence, but to no purpose. As the stars began to peep out, observers were multiplied. Capella, Rigil, Beta (B) in the Bull, Delta in Orion, and Alpha (A) in the Hare, came to the meridian, and their transits were marked by one observer; while another, with close attention, watched through the fading light of the western horizon for the Comet and its tail. The last faint streak of day gilded the west, beautiful and delicate fleeces of zonder cloud cloud curtained the bed of the sun, the upper sky was studded with stars, and all hoped of seeing the Comet that evening had vanished.   
Soon after we had retired, the officer of the watch announced the appearance of the Comet in the west. The phenomenon was sublime and beautiful. The needle was greatly agitated; and a strongly marked pencil of light was streaming up from the path of the sun in an oblique direction to the southward and eastward; its edges were parallel. It was about 1 deg. 30 min broad and 30 deg. long. Stars could be seen twinkling through it, and no doubt was at first entertained but that this was the tail of the Comet. The officer of the watch was directed to search the eastern sky with the telescope in the morning, from early dawn, and before, till sunrise. Nothing strange or uncommon was noted by him.  
Tuesday was a beautiful day; the air was still and the sky clear. With the aid of the telescopes, a regular and systematic examination of the heavens was commenced. Every point of space within 15 deg. of the sun, in all directions, was passed and repassed over and over again, through the field of the telescopes, and minutely examined, in the hope of discovering the Comet itself. The entire day was occupied in thus exploring that portion of the heavens.  In the afternoon a black spot, in shape not unlike a liberty cap, was discovered in the sun. But the day was fast declining, and with the fading light of evening the interest was too intense to turn away from the telescope for other and more exact observations upon this spot.   
The sun was clear, gilding, as it sunk below the hills, a narrow streak of wane cloud, seen through the tree-tops beyond the Potomac.  
The tail had appeared of great length for the first time the evening before; therefore we expected to find its length this evening greatly increased. It was a moment of intense interest when the first stars began to appear. The last rays of the sun still lingered on the horizon; and at this moment, just about the region of the upper crepusculum, a well-defined pencil of hairy light, was seen pointing towards the Sun. At 5h. 41m. sidereal time, the first measurement of length of the tail was taken it measured 41 deg. to the horizon. At 6h. 19m. it had become moat distinct. It was then 1 deg. 45m. broad, and 55 deg. long, not including the part below the horizon, which, supposing its terminus to be near the sun, could not, owing to the oblique angle which it made with the horizon, be less than 10 or 15 degrees more.  It now commenced gradually to fade away, and in a short time had entirely disappeared. Tho morning observations were diligently renewed, but nothing could be seen worthy of note.

THE STRANGE LIGHT.”  
Hydrographical OFFICE, March 10, 1843.  
On Monday morning, the 6th, our attention was called to  
a paragraph in the newspapers stating that a Comet was visi­  
ble near the sun at mid-day with the naked eye. The sky  
was clear; but, not being able to discover any thing with the  
unassisted eye, recourse was had to a telescope without any  
better success. About sunset in the evening the examination  
was renewed with great diligence, but to no purpose.  
As  
the stars began te peep out, observers were multiplied ; Ca  
pella, Rigil, Beta (B) in the Bull, Delta in Orion, and  
Alpha (A) in the Hare, came to the meridian and their  
transit* were marked by one observer, while another, with  
close attention, watched through the fading light of the west  
ern horizon for the Comet and its tail. The last faint streak  
of day gilded the west, beautiful and delicate fleeces of  
sonder cloud curtained the bed of the sun, the upper sky was  
studded with stars, and all hopes of seeing the Comet Iha*  
evening had vanished.  
Soon after we had retired, the officer of the watch an­  
nounced the appearance of the Comet in the west. The  
phenomenon was sublime and beautiful. The needle was  
greatly agitated; and a strongly marked pencil of light was  
streaming up from the path of the sun in an oblique direction  
to the southward and eastward ; its edges were parallel. It  
was about 1 deg. 30 min. broad and 30 deg. long. Stars could  
be seen twinkling through it, and no doubt was at first enter­  
tained but that this was the tail of the Comet. The officer  
of the watch was directed to search the eastern sky with the  
telescope in the morning, from early dawn and before till  
sunrise. Nothing strange or uncommon was noted by him.  
Tuesday was a beautiful day ; the air was still and the sky  
clear. With the aid of the telescopes, a regular and syste­  
matic examination of the heavens was commenced. Every  
point of space within 15 deg. of the sun, in all directions, was  
passed and repassed over and over again, through the field of  
the alescopes, and minutely examined, in the hope of discov­  
ering the Comet itself. The entire day was occupied in  
thus exploring that portion of the heavens. In the afternoon a  
black spot, in shape not unlike a liberty cap, was discovered  
on the sun. But the day was fast declining, and with the  
fading light of evening the interest was too intense to turn  
away from the telescope for other and more exact observations  
upon this spot.  
The sun set clear, gilding, as it sunk below the hills, a nar­  
row streak of wane cloud, seen through the tree-tops beyond  
the Potomac.  
  
l he “ tail &quot; had appeared of great length for the first time  
the evening before ; therefore we expected to find its length  
this evening greatly increased. It was a moment of intense  
interest when the first stars began to appear. The last rays  
of the sun still lingered on the horizon ; and at this moment,  
just about the region of the upper crepusculum, a well-defin­  
ed pencil of hairy light, was seen pointing towards the sun.  
At 5b. 41m. siderial time, the first measurement of length of  
the &quot;tail&quot; was taken; it measured 41 deg. to the horizon.  
At 6b. 19m. it had became most distinct. It was then I deg.  
45m. broad and 55 deg. long, not including the part below the  
horizon, which, supposing its terminus to be near the sun,  
could not, owing to the oblique angle which it made with the  
horizon, be less than 10 or 15 degrees more. It now com­  
menced gradually to fade way, and in a short time bad entire­  
ly disappeared. The morning observations were diligently  
renewed, but nothing could be seen worthy of note.  
Wednesday, flying masses of “ Cirrus stratus ” occasion­  
ally obscured the sun ; but preparations were made for deter­  
mining the right ascension and declination of the “ spot ” on  
the disc of the sun ; if, perchance, that spot should prove to  
be the nucleus of the comet. At noon, the clouds broke  
away from the sun, and, though the glass was of feeble power,  
the well-defined dark spot was distinctly seen through it.  
The instrument itself was graduated to seconds, with micro­  
meter readings ; and, while the sun was in transit, observa­  
tions for apparent right ascension and declination of the “ spot”  
, were made with the hope of reporting them the next day,  
i and thence deducing its motions during the interval. A thick­  
l ly clouded sky all of Thursday and so far of Friday (10 A.  
M.) with every prospect of continuance, has not permitted  
this hope to be realized.  
Most of the afternoon of Wednes.  
day the sun was obscured, or but dimly seen through  
masses of intervening clouds.  
it, however, set in a clear  
and narrow streak of reddish sky, which was soon cover­  
ed up by a bank of clouds 10 deg. high. Above this mass  
and upwards the sky was, for the most part, clear; and  
though the evening was not favorable for the appearance  
of a “ zodiacal light,” the clear sky was watched with  
eager but confident expectation of again seeing the same  
beautiful phenomenon, which had excited our admiration  
and wonder for the two evenings previous. According  
ly at 55. 5402. siderial time, and much to the delight of all  
present, this beautiful streak of light was dimly seen. In  
twenty minutes afterwards it was most distinct, spanning the  
southwestern sky with a faint nebulous arch, that reached  
away beyond Sirius to the east, and rested on Epsilon in  
the constellation of the Great Dog. It measured 85 deg. in  
length above the horizon, far below which it seemed to ex­  
tend. At 6h. 24m., just thirty minutes from its first ap­  
pearance, this magnificent spectacle was lost in the gathering  
clouds.  
The next morning observations tn the east were again re­  
newed as before, but without discovering any traces of nu­  
cleus, tail, or zodiacal light.  
The sky has remained completely overcast up to the hour  
of writing, and no opportunity has occurred fr repeating  
the observations, by which the motions (if any) of the spot  
over the sun’s disc might be approximated.  
Such, up te the present time, is the history, and such has  
been the appearance of this phenomenon, as observed here.  
The return of clear weather and the accounts of other ob­  
servers are anxiously looked for. So far my own observa­  
tions are not sufficient to enable me to hazard more than a  
mere conjecture, much less would they justify any positive  
assertion, as to whether this be the tail of a comet or not.  
If  
it be a comet, the probabilities are that it is receding from  
the sun, and will soon again be lost to us.

The Birange Light.  
: HyproGraPHICAL UFFICZ, March 10, 1348.  
  
On Mondsy morning, the 6th, our attention wes  
called 10 a pucsgraph in the newspapers stating  
that &amp;&#x27;CoMeT wus visible near the suu at mid-day  
with the naked eye. The sky was clear; but, nut  
being able to discuverany thing with the unassisted  
Bye, recourse was had to a telescope, without aay  
better success. About suusctin the evening the  
examination was renewed with great diligence, bul  
to no purpuse. As the stars begaa lu peep out,  
observers were muluplied. Capella, Rigi, Bea  
(B) in the Bull, Delta in Orion, und Alpna (A) in  
the Hare, came to the mendian, and their transits  
were marked by one observer; while another, with  
close attention, watched through the fading light  
‘of the western horizon for the Comet and 1s tail.  
The iast faint stresk of day gilded the west, beas-  
tifu! and delicate fleecss of gonder cloud curtained  
the bed of the suu, tis upper sky was studded  
with stars, and all hopes of seeing the Comet that  
evening had vanished.  
  
Soon after we had retired, the officer of the watch  
mnnounced the appearance of the Comet in the  
west. The phenomenon was sublime and beauti-  
ful. The needle was greatly agitated: and a  
strongly marked pencil of light was streaming up  
from the path of the sun in an oblique direction  
to the southward and eastward; its edges were  
parallel. It was about ] deg. 30 min. broad and  
30 deg. long. Stars could be seen twinkling  
through it, aud no doubt was at first entertaived  
but that this was the tail of the Comet. The ofhi-  
csr of the watch was directed to search the eastern  
sky with the telescope in the morning, from early  
dawn, and before, till sunrise. Nothing strange or  
uncommon was noted by him.  
  
Tuesday was a beautiful day; the air was still  
and the sky clear. With the aid of the telescopes,  
a regular and systematic examination of the hea-  
vens was commenced. Every point of space within  
15 deg. of the sun, in all directions, was passed  
und repassed over and over egaim, through the  
field of the telescopes, and minutely examined, iu  
the hope of discovering the Comet itself. The  
entire day was occupied in thus exploring thu  
portion of the heavens. Ln the afternoon a black  
spot, in shape not unlike a hberty cap, was dis-  
covered in the sun. But the day was fast declia-  
ing, and with the fading hight of evening the in-  
terest was too intense to turn awey from the tele-  
scepe for other and more exact observations upan  
this spot.  
  
The sun was clear, gilding, as it sunk below the  
hills, &amp; narrow streak of wane cloud, seen through  
the tree-tops beyond the Potomac.  
  
The ¢ tail” had appeared of great length for  
the first ume the evening before; therefore we  
expected to find its length this evening greatly in-  
creased. lt was a moment of intense interest  
when the first stara began to appear. The last  
rays of the sun still lingered on the horizon; and  
at this moment, just abaut the region of the upper  
crepusculum, a well-defined pencil of hairy light,  
was seen pointing towards the sun. At Sh. 41m.  
  
siderial time, the first measurement of length of  
the “ tail’ was taken ; it measured 41 deg. to the  
horizon. At 6b. 19m. it had become most distinct.  
It was then 1 deg. 45m. broad, and 55 deg. long,  
not including the part below the horizon, which,  
supposing ils terminus to be near the sun, could  
not, owing to the oblique angle which it made with  
the horizon, be less than 10 or 15 degrees more.  
It now commenced gradually to fade away, and  
jn a short time had entirely disappeared. The  
morning observations were diligently renewed, but  
nothing could be seen worthy of note.  
  
Wednesday, flying masses of ** Cirrus stratus”  
occasionally obscured the sun; but preparations  
were made for determining the right ascension and  
declination of the “spot’’ on the disc of the sun;  
  
if, perchance, that spot should prove to be the nu-  
  
cleus of the comet. At noon the clouds breke  
away from the sun, end, though the glass was of  
feeble power, the well-defined dark spot was &amp;is-  
tinctly seen throughit. Tue instrument itself was  
gradusted to secends, with micrometer readings;  
  
and, while the sun was in transit, observations  
for appa.ent rigut ‘ascension and declination of  
  
the spot’ were made with the hope of reporting  
  
them the next day, and thence deducing its motions  
during the interval. A thickly clouded sky all of  
  
Thursday and so far of Friday (10 A. M.) with  
every prospect of continuance, has not parmitted  
this hope to be realized. Most of the afternoon  
of Wednesday the sun was obscured, or but dimly  
seen through massos of intervening clouds. Ii,  
however, set in a clear ard narrow streak of recd-  
dish sky, which was soon covered up by a bank of  
clouds 10 deg. high. Above this mass and upwards  
the sky was, for tne most part, clear; and though  
evening was not favorable for the appearance of a  
“ zodiacal light,” the clear sky was watched with  
eager but confident expectation of egain seeing the  
same beautifal phenomenon, which had excited our  
admiration 8nd woader for the two evenings pre-  
vious. Accordingly at Sh. d4m. siderial time, and  
much to the delight of all present, this beautiful  
streak of light was dimly seen. Intweaty minutes  
afterwards it was most distinct, spanning the  
southwestern sky with a faint nebulous arch, that  
reached away beyond Sirius to the East, and rest-

herizon, far below which it seems to extend. At  
6h. 24m., just thirty minutes from its ficst appear-

The next morning observations in the east were

••THK STRANGK LIGHT.”  
Hydiuk.uai&#x27;Hu al On March 10, 1343.  
On Monday morning, the tith, our attention  
was called to a paragraph in the newspapers sta­  
ting that a Comet was visible near the sun at  
mid-day with the naked eye. The sky was clear;  
but, not being able to discover any thing with the  
unassisted eye, recourse was had to a telescope  
without any better success. About sunset in the  
evening the examination was renewed With great j  
diligence*, but to no purpose. As the stars be- j  
scat to peep out, observers were multiplied; Ca- .  
pel la, Ri.’il, Beta (B) in the Bull, Delta in Orion, j  
and Alpha (A) in the Hare, came to tbe meri­  
dian and their transits were marked by otic ob- j  
server, while another, with close attention,  
watched through the lading light of the western |  
horizon for the Cornet and its tail. The last  
faint streak of day gilded the west, beautiful and  
delicate llceces of sonder cloud curtained the bed  
of the sun, the upper sky was studded with stars,  
and all hopes of seeing the Comet that evening  
had vanished. j  
Soon after we had retired, the officer of the j  
watch announced the appearance of the Comet in  
the west. The phenomenon was sublime and  
beautiful. The needle was greatly agitated; and  
a strongly marked pencil of light was streaming  
up from the path of the sun in an oblique direc­  
tien to the southward and eastward; its edges  
were parallel. It was about 1 deg. 30 min.  
broad and 30 deg long. Stars could be seen  
twinkling through it, and no doubt was at first  
entertained but that this was the tail of the  
Comet. The officer of the watch was directed  
to search the eastern sky with the telescope in  
the morning, from early dawn and before till sun­  
rise. Nothing strange ci uncommon was noted  
by Rim.  
•_ _ . . • « .« •  
  
Tuesday was a ueaumui aay; me air was sun  
and the sky clear. With the aid of the tele­  
scopes, a regular and systematic examination of  
the heavens was commenced. Every point of  
space within 45 deg. of the sun, in all directions,  
was passed and ropassed, over and over again,  
through the field of the ttdescopes, and minutely  
examined, in the hope of discovering the Comet  
itself. The entire day was occupied in thus ex­  
ploring that portion of the heavens. In the af­  
ternoon a black spot, in shape not unlike a liberty  
cap, was discovered on the sun. But the day  
was fast declining, and with the fading light of  
evening the interest was too intense to turn away  
from the telescope for other and more exact ob­  
servations upon this spot.  
The sun set clear, gilding, as it sunk below the  
hills, a narrow streak of trune cloud, seen through  
the tree-tops beyond the Potomac.  
The “tail” had appeared of great length for the  
first time the evening before; therefore we ex­  
pected to find it* length this evciing greatly in­  
creased. it was a moment of intense interest  
when the stars first began to appear. The last  
rays of the sun still lingered on the horizon; and  
at&#x27;this moment, just about the region of the upper  
crcpusculum, a well-defined pencil ol hairy light,  
was seen pointing towards the sun. At 5h. 41m.  
siderial time, the first measurement of length of  
the “tail” was taken; it measured 41 deg. to the  
horizon. At Gh. 19m. it had become most dis­  
tinct. It was then 1 deg 45 m. broad and 55 deg.  
long, not including the part below the horizon,  
which, supposing its terminus to be near the sun,  
could not, owing to the oblique angle w&#x27;hich it  
made with the horizon, be bss than 10 or 15 de­  
grees more. It now commenced gradually to  
fade away, and in a slmrt time had entirely dis­  
appeared. The morning observations, were dili­  
gently renewed, but nothing could be seen worthy  
of note.  
  
Wednesday, Hying masses or -cirrus stratus  
occasionally obscured the sun : but preparations  
were made for determining the right ascension  
and declination of the “spot&quot; on the disc of the  
sun; if, perchance, that spot should prove to be  
the nucleus of the comet. At noon, the clouds  
broke away from the sun, and, though the glass  
was of feeble power, the well-defined dark spot  
was distinctly seen through it. The instrument  
itself was graduated to seconds, with micrometer  
readings; and, while the sun was in transit, ob­  
servations for apparent right ascension and de­  
clination of the “spot&quot; were made with the hope ;  
of reporting them the next day, and thence de­  
ducing its motions during the interval. A thick­  
ly clouded skv all ot Thursday and so lar of  
Friday (10 A.M.) with every prospect of con-|  
tinuance, has not permitted this hope to be re- j  
alized. Most of the afternoon of Wednesday j  
the sun was obscured, or but dimly seen through j  
masses of intervening clouds. It, however, set,  
in a clear and narrow streak of reddish sky,  
which was soon covered up by a bank of clouds  
10 deg. high. Above this mass and upwards the j  
skv was, for the most part, clear; and though the^  
evening was not favorable for the appearance of  
a “zodiacal light,” the clear sky was watched  
with eager but confident expectation of again  
seeing the same beautiful phenomenon, which  
had excited our admiration and wonder for the  
two evenings previous. Accordingly at 5h. 51m.  
siderial tiine, and much to the delight of all pre­  
sent, this beautiful streak of light was dimly seen.  
In twenty minutes atterwards it was most dis­  
tinct, spanning the southwestern sky with a faint  
nebulous arch, that reached away beyond Sirius .  
to the east; and rested on Lpsilon in the ccnsiei-,  
lation of the Great Dog. It measured S3 deg. i  
in length above the horizon, far below whicn it.  
seemed to extend. At Gh- 24m., just thirty min-.  
utes from its first appearance, this magnificent!  
spectacle was lost in the gathering clouds.  
The next morning observations in the east were  
  
again renewed as before, but without discovering  
any traces of nucleus, tail, or zodiacal light.  
The sky has remained completely overcast up  
to the hour of writing, and no opportunity has  
occurred for repeating the observations, by which  
the motions (if any) of the spot over the sun’s  
disc might be approximated.  
S.uch, up to the present time, is the history,  
and such has been the appearance of this phe­  
nomenon, as observed here. The return of clear  
weather and the accounts of other observers are  
anxiously looked for. So far my own observa­  
tions are not sufficient to enablo me io hazard  
more than a mere conjecture, much less would  
they justify any positive assertion, as to whether  
this be the tail of a comet or not. If it be a  
comet, the probabilities are that is receding from  
the sun, and will soon again be lost to us.

«THE STRANGE LIGHT.”  
  
  
  
Hyprocreuicar Orrice, March 11, 1843.  
  
On Monday morning, the 6th, our attention was  
called to a paragraph in the newspapers stating that  
a Comet was visible near the sun at mid-day with  
the naked eye. The sky was clear; but not being  
able to discover any thing with the unassisted eye,  
recourse was had to a telescope, without any better  
success. About sunset in the evening the examina.  
tion was renewed with great diligence, but to no  
purpose, As the stars began to peep out, observers  
were multiplied; Capella, Rigil, Beta in the Bull,  
Delta in Orion, and Alpha in the Hare, came to the  
meridian and their transits were marked by one ob.  
server, while another, with close attention, watched  
through the fading light of the western horizon for  
the Comet and its tail. The last faint streak of day  
gilded the west, beautiful and delicate fleeces of  
sonder cloud curtained the bed of the sun, the upper  
sky was studded with stars, and all hopes of seeing  
the Comet that evening had vanished.  
  
Soon after we had retired, the officer of the watch  
announced the appearance of the Comet in the west.  
The phenomenon was sublime and beautiful. The |  
needle was greatly agitated; and a strongly marked  
pencil of light was streaming up from the path of  
the sun in an oblique direction to the southward and  
eastward ; its edges were parallel. It was about |  
degree 30 minutes broad, and 30 degrees long. Stars  
could be scen twinkling through it, and no doubt  
was at first entertained but that this was the tail of  
the Comet. The officer of the watch was directed  
to search the eastern sky with the telescope in the  
morning, from early dawn and before till sunrise.  
Nothing strange or unco:nmon was noted by him.  
  
Tuesday was a beautiful day ; the air was still and  
the sky clear. With the aid of telescopes, a regular  
and systematic examination of the heavens was com.  
meneed. Every point of space within 15 degrees of  
the sun, in all directions, was passed and repassed  
over and over again, through the field of the tele.  
scopes, and minutely examined, in the hope of dis.  
covering the Comet itself. The entire day was occu-  
pied in thus exploring that portion of the heavens,  
In the afternoon a black spot, in shape not unlike  
a liberty cap, was discovered on the sun. But the  
day was fast declining, and with the fading light of  
evening the interest was too intense to turn away  
from the telescope for other and more exact observa.  
tions upon this spot.  
  
‘The sun set clear, gilding, as it sunk below the  
hills, a narrow streak of wane cloud, seen through  
the tree-tops beyond the Potomac.  
  
The “tail” had appeared of great length for the  
first time the evening before; therefore we expected  
to find its length this evening greatly increased. It  
was a moment of intense interest when the first stars  
began to appear. ‘The last rays of the sun still lin-  
gered on the horizon; and at this moment, just about  
the region of the upper crepusculum, a well-defined  
pencil of hairy light was seen pointing towards the  
sun. At 5h. 41m., siderial time, the first measu:e-

below the horizon, which, supposing its terminus to  
be near the sun, could not, owing to the oblique an-  
gle which it made with the horizon, be Jess than 10  
or 15 degrees more. It now commenced gradually  
to fade away, and in a short time had entirely disap-  
peared. The morning observations were diligently  
renewed, but nothing could be seen worthy of note.  
Wednesday, flymg masses of “ Cirrus stratus” oc-  
casionally obscured the sun; but preparations were  
made for determining the right ascension and decli-  
nation of the “spot ” on the disc of the sun; if, per-  
chance, that spot should prove to be the nucleus of  
the comet. At noon the clouds broke away from the  
sun, and, though the glass was of feeble power, the  
wellde-fined dark spot was distinctly seen through it  
The instrument itself was graduated to seconds, with  
micrometer readings; and, while the sun was in  
transit, observations for apparent right ascension and  
declination of the ‘* spot” were made with the hope  
of reporting them the next day, and thence deducing its

“THE STRANGE LIGHT.”  
&#x27;Hydrographical Office^ M&#x27;vch 10, 1843. j  
On Monday morning,&#x27;6th, our atten­  
was called to a paragraph in the newspa- j  
pers. stating that a comet was visible}  
near the sun at mid-day with tlie naked I  
eye. The sky was clear; but, not being I  
able to discover anything with the units-1  
sisted eye, recource was had to a teles-;  
rope, without any better success. A­  
&#x27;bout sunset in the evening, the exam in a- j  
tion was renewed with great diligence;  
but to no purpose. As the stars began  
to peep out, observers were multiplied;  
Capella, Bigil, Beta (B) in the Bull,  
Belta in Orion, and Alpha (A) in the!  
Hare, came to the meridian, and their  
transits were marked by one observer;}  
while another, with close attention^,  
watched through the fading light of the  
western horizon for the comet and its;  
tail. The last faint streak of day gilded 1  
’&#x27;the west, beautiful and delicate fleeces&#x27;  
of sonder cloud curtained the bed of the  
sun, the upper sky was studded with!  
stars, and all hopes uf seeing the comet  
that evening had vanished.  
* Soon after we had retired, the officer j  
of the watch announced the oppearauce i  
of the comet in the west. The plienom-}  
cnon was sublime and beautiful. The;  
needle was greatly agitated; and ai  
strongly marked pencil of light was!  
streaming up from the path of the sun, in }  
an oblique diiiction, to the southward i  
and eastward; its edges were parallel.)  
It was about 1 deg. 30 min. broad, and ;  
30 deg. long. Stars could be seen I  
twinkling through it, and no doubt was)  
at first entertained but that this was thei  
tail of the comet. The officer of the j  
watch was directed to search the eastern !  
sky with the telescope in the morning,  
from early dawn and before, till sun-i  
rise. Nothing strange or uncommon was)  
‘noted by him.  
Tuesday was a beautiful day; the air;  
’was still and the sky clear. With the&#x27;  
aid of the telescopes, a regular and sys- i  
tematic examination or tne heavens was :  
commenced. Every point of space with-!  
&#x27;in 15 deg. of the sun, in all directions, j  
was &#x27;passed and repassed over and over!  
again, through the field of the telescopes,!  
and &#x27;minutely examined, in the hope ol ;  
discovering the comet itself. The entire  
day was occupied in thus exploring that)  
pm tion of the heavens. In the afternoon, I  
a black spot, in shape not unlike a liber-1  
‘ty cap,- was discovered on the sun.—  
But lb e-day was fast declining, anil with!  
the fading light of evening the interest |  
was too intense to turn away from liie  
telescope for other and more exact obser- ]  
vations upon this spot.  
The sun set clear, gilding, as it sunk!  
below the hills, a narrow streak of wane i  
cloud, seen through the tree-tops beyond |  
the Potomac.  
  
I lie “tail” had .appeared of great;  
&#x27;length for the first time the evening be­  
lorc; therefore we-expected to find its!  
length this evening greatly increased,—  
It was a moment of intense ’enteres11  
wherf tfie first stars began to appear.— j  
The last rays of the sun still lingered on i  
the horizon; arid at this moment, just a-!  
bout the region of the upper crepuscu-i  
lum. a well-defined pencil of hairy light!  
Was seen pointing towards the sun. I  
&quot;At 5li. 4-1 m., siderial time, the first;  
‘measurement of length of the ‘“tall” was |  
taken; it measured 41 deg. to the Imri-;  
zon. At&#x27;6h. 19m. it had become most  
distinct. It was then 1 deg. 45iti. broad,|  
4611^55 Jeg. long, not including the part  
  
below the horizon, which, supposing its  
terminus to be near the snn, could not,  
owing to the oblique angle which it made  
with the horizon, be less than 10 or 15  
degrees more. It now commenced grad­  
ually to fade away, and in a short time  
had entirely disappeared. The morn­  
ing observations were diligently renew­  
ed, hut nothing could be seen worthy of  
note.  
Wednesday, flying masses of ‘‘cirrus  
stratus” occasionally obscured the sun;  
but preparations were made for deter­  
mining the light ascension and declina­  
tion of the “spot” on the disc of the sun,  
if, perchance, that spot should prove to  
be the nucleus of the comet. At noon,  
the clouds broke away from the -sun,  
and, though the glass was of feeble pow­  
er, the well-defined dark&#x27; spot was dis­  
tinctly seen through it. The instrument  
itself was graduated to seconds, with mi­  
crometer readings; and, while the sun  
was in transit, observations for apparent  
jright ascension and declination of the  
“spot” were made, with the hope of re­  
porting them the next day, and thence  
deducing its motions during the inteival.  
A thickly clouded sky all of Thursday,  
and so far of Friday, (10 a. in..) with  
every jnospect of continuance, has not  
permitted this hope to be realized.—  
Most of the afternoon of Wednesday the  
sun was obscured, or hut dimly seen  
through the masses of intervening clouds.  
It, however, -set in a clear and narrow  
streak of reddish skv, which was soon  
covered up by a bank of clounds 10 deg.  
high. Above this mass, and upwards,  
the sky was, for the most part, clear;  
and though the evening was not favora­  
ble for the appearance of a “zodiacal  
light,” the clear sky was watched with  
eager but confident expectation of again  
seeing the same beautiful phenomenon,  
which had excited our admiration and  
wonder for the two evenings previous.—  
  
Accordingly, at on. o-tm., siuenai nine,  
and much to (he delight of til l present,  
this beautiful streak of light was dimly  
seen. In twenty minutes afterwards it  
was most distinct, spanning the south­  
western sky with a faint nebulous arch,  
that reached away beyond Sirius- to the  
east, and rested on Kpsilon in the con­  
stellation of the Great Dog. It meas­  
ured 85 deg. in length above the hori­  
zon, far below which it seemed to ex­  
tend. At 6h. 24m., just thirty minutes  
from its first appearance, this magnificent  
spectacle-was lost in the gathering clouds.  
The next morning, observations in the  
east were again renewed, as belore, but  
without discovering any traces of nucle­  
us, tail, or zodiacal light.  
The sky lias remained completely o­  
vercust up to the hour of writing, .and no  
opportunity has occurred for lepeatiug  
i he observations, by which the motions  
(if any) of the spot over the sun&#x27;s disc  
■might be approximated.  
Such, up to the present time, is the  
history, such has been the appearance ol  
this phenomenon, as observed here.—  
The return of clear weather and the ac­  
counts of other observers are anxiously  
looked for. So far, my own observa­  
tions are not sufficient to enable me to  
hazard more than a mere conjecture;  
much less would they justify any posi­  
tive assertion, as to whether this be the  
tail of a comet or nor. 11 it be a comet,  
the probabilities are that it is receding  
from the sun, and will soon again be  
lost to us.  
M. F. MAURY, Lieut. U. S. N. ;  
  
“THE STRANGE LIGHT” AGAIN.  
Hydrographical Office, March 11, 1843.  
Advantage was taken of the clear sky  
this morning to examine the disc of the  
•uu for the spot which so much attracted  
)ur attention and excited our specula­  
tions a lew days ago. It was gone! Sub­  
sequent observations may enable us to  
determine &#x27;wether or not this spot was  
the nebula of a comet.  
The wind was high, and the sun unob­  
scured after 10.a. in.; and, though the  
day was very unfavorable for observa­  
tions, search for the comet was diligent­  
ly renewed. It could not be seen.  
From sunset till the stars came out,  
our telescopes were intently pointed to  
the westean sky, with the hope of catch­  
ing at least a glimpse of the comet  
through the fading twilight. But we  
were compelled to content ourselves with  
admiring the wonderful beauty and gran­  
deur of its train, the iirst tr ices ol which  
were seen at Gh. 2m., siderial time.—  
At 6h. 28m., its greatest breadth whs 1  
deg. 40 min., as nearly as couid be as­  
certained, for the bright moonlight ren.  
dered the measurement imperfect. The  
curve, before described, was again seen  
this evening, and in the same position,  
but much more indislinclv. At 10 min­  
utes after 0 o’clock, the tail had not  
gone down, but had giadually laded a­  
vvay in the blaze of the west.  
Comparing my own observations with  
the accounts which have already reached  
us from dilferment parts of the country,  
there appears now to be but little doubt  
but that this is the tail of a comet, and  
that the head itself has been seen at mid­  
day in&#x27; the East, with the naked eye.—  
If so, foi length of tail and magnitude ol  
nebula, it may be classed among the  
most remarkable that have ever appear­  
ed. In the year 43 B. C., historians  
tell-us of • a hairy star that was seen by  
daylight. in the A. D. 1402. two com­  
ets were seen in broad dav, and the tail  
of one of the in at neon, Tycho Brahe  
discovered a comet by daylight in 1577.  
The comet of 1744 could be seen in the  
day time without the aid of glasses. Its  
tail, though not so long as this, was cur­  
ved, and formed an arch of 00 deg.;  
  
though, for a part of the time, it had sev- ^  
| era I tails, ihe length ol which varied SO f  
deg. to 40 deg. The comet of IG80—the !  
j most celebrated of modern times—had ■  
! a tail computed at from 70 deg. to 90  
deg. That of 1G18 had the largest tAil  
on record—104 deg.; and (his vies with  
that in length.  
“The tail,” says Vince, in his Astron- j  
omy, “increrses as the comet approaches j  
its phcrihelion; immediately after which, i  
it is the longest and most luminous, and j  
then it is a little bent and convex to-j  
wards those parts to which the comet is |  
moying; the tail then decreases.”  
If this comet has obeyed this rule, it;  
has already doubled the sun, ami is now  
on its way back, to be again lost in the  
regions of space.

very unlavorable for observations, search  
lor the comtl was diligentlv renewed. It  
could foutbeaeen.

Comparing by my own observation with  
the accounts which have already reached us  
from different parts of tlte country, there  
appears now to be but little doubt but that  
this i the tail of a Comet, and that the  
head itself has been seen at mid-day in the  
East with1 the naked eye. &#x27; If sd, (Or length

with the telenoope in th mornings from ewty dewn  
and before till sunrise. Nothing strange er ancemi  
mon was noted by fatal  
Tuesday was a beamtiful day; the air was Mill and  
the sky clear. With the aid of the telesreper, a reg­  
alar and systematic examination of the heavens wes  
commenced. Every point of spues withio IS dex M  
the aan, in all directions, wes passed and repumred over  
and overagain, through die field of the teleserpes, and  
minutely examined, in the hope of diecevering the  
Camel ftvelf. The entire day was ocewpied in thee  
exploring that portion of the heavens, in the after  
noon a blrek #pot, tn shepe not unlike a liberty cap,  
was discovered on the sun. But the day area fort de­  
elining, and with the fading light of evening the inter­  
est was too intense to turn away from the telescope for  
other and more exact cheervationen upon thia spot.  
The son set clear, gilding, as it sunk below the hille,  
a narrow steak of wene cloud, mow through the tree,  
tope beyond the Potomac.  
The “ tail” had appeared of great length for the Grot  
time the evening before I therefore we expected to  
find its length this evening greatly inereared. It war  
a moment of intere interest when the firet etars has  
gun to appear. The Ikai rays of the sen still lingered  
on the horizon i and at this moment, juet about the re.  
gion of the upper erepasculom, a well-defined pencil  
of hairy light, was seen pointing towarde the run.  
At 5h. 41m. aiderrsi time, the first messuromment of  
length of the &quot;tail” was taken) it measured 41 deg.  
to the horizon. At Ch. 19m. it had became most die.  
tinet. It was then I deg. 45m. broad and 56 deg. long  
not including the part below the horizon, which, op.  
posing its terminus to be near the aan, could mot, ow.  
ing to the oblique angle which it made with the heri.  
sen, be less than 10 or 15 degrees more.  
Il now com.  
menced gradually to fade way, and in a short time had  
entirely disappeared. The morning observations were  
diligently renewed, but nothing could be seen worthy  
of note.  
Wednesday, flying masses of Cirrus stratus” ocea.  
. sionally obscured the sun; but preparations were made  
i for determinig the right ascension and derlination of  
the &quot;spot” on the disc of the min ; if, perchence, that  
spot should prove to be the nucleus of the comer. At  
noon, the clouds broke away from the sun, and, though  
the glass was of feeble power, the well-defined dark spot  
was distinctly seen through it. The instrument itself  
was graduated to seconds, with micrometer readinge,  
and, while the sun was in transit, obrervations for ap.  
parent right ascension and declination of the &quot;spo&quot;  
were made with the hope of reporting them the next  
day, and thenee deducing its motion during the inter,  
val. A thickly clouded sky all of Thursday and so fir  
of Friday (10 A. M.) with every prompeet of centin.  
nance, hasnot permitted this hope to be realized. Most  
of the afternoon of Wednesday the sun was obscured,  
or but dimly seen through masses of intervening clouds, |  
it, however, set in a clear and narrow streak of red.  
dish sky, which was soon covered up by a bank of  
elonds 10 deg. high. Above this mass end upwards  
the sky was, for the most part, clear; and though the  
evening was not favorable for the sppearanet of a  
&quot; zodiacal light,&quot; the clear sky was warehed with e.i  
ger but confident expeetationef again seeing the same !  
beauriful phenomenon, which had excited ooradmi. I  
ration and wonder for the two evenings previous. Ar.  
cordinglyat 5h. 54m. siderial time, and much to the  
delight of all present, this beautiful streak of lighi was  
dimly seen. In twenty minutes afterward* it was  
most distinct, spanning the southwestern »ky with a  
faint nebulous arch, that reached away beyond fir - .  
to the east, and rested on Epsilon in the constellaton &#x27;  
of the Great Dog. It measured 85 des. in lengih above  
the horizon, far below which it seamed to attend. At  
6h. 24m., just thirty minutes from its first sbpcaranee,  
this magnificent spectacle was lost in the gatheriu  
clouds.  
The next morning observatiee in the oust were 1  
again renewed as before, but without discovering any  
traces of necleous, tail, or zodiacal light. I  
The sky has remained combletely overeset up ta !  
the hour of writing, and no opportunity has uerarri  
for repeating the observations, by which the motio  
(if any) of the spot over the aun,* diac might be spptus  
imnted.

 the Hydrographical Office in that  
city:—‘*On Monday morning, March 6th, our  
attention was called to a paragraph in the news-  
papers, stating that a comet was visible near the  
sun at mid-day with the naked eye. The sky  
was clear, but, not being able to discover any  
thing with the unassisted eye, resource was had  
to a telescope, without any better success. About  
Sunset in the evening, the examination was re-  
newed with great diligence, but to no purpose.  
The last faint streak of day gilded the west,  
beautiful and delicate fleeces of cloud curtained  
the bed of the sun, the upper sky was studded  
with stars, and all hopes of seeing the comet that  
evening had vanished. Soon after we had re-  
tired, the officer of the watch announced the  
appearance of the comet in the west. The phe-  
nomenon was sublime and beautiful. The needle  
wes greatly agitated; and a strongly marked  
pencil of light was streaming up from the path  
of the sun, in an oblique direction, to the south-  
ward and eastward; its edges were parallel. It  
was 1° 30’ broad, and 80° long. Stars could be  
Seen twinkling through it, and no doubt was at  
first entertained but that this was the tail of the  
Comet. The officer of the watch was directed to  
search the eastern sky with the telescope in the  
morning, from early dawn and before, till sun-  
rise. Nothing strange or uncommon was noted  
by him. Tuesday was a beautiful day. The sun  
vas clear, gilding, as it sunk below the hills, a  
harrow streak of cloud, seen through the tree-  
  
  
  
tops beyond the Potomac. The tail had appeared  
of great length for the first time the evening be-  
fore; therefore, we expected to find its length  
this evening greatly increased. It was a moment  
of intense interest when the first stars began tc  
appear. The last rays of the sun still lingered  
on the horizon, and at this moment a well-defined  
pencil of hairy light was seen pointing toward  
the sun. At 5h. 41 m., siderial time, the first  
measurement of length of the tail was taken; it  
measured 41° to the horizon. At 6h. 19 m. it  
had become most distinct. It was then 1° 45/  
broad, and 55° long, not including the part below  
the horizon, which, supposing its terminus to be  
near the sun, could not, owing to the oblique  
angle which it made with the horizon, be less  
than 10° or 165° more. It now commenced  
gradually to fade away, and in a short time had  
entirely disappeared. The morning observa-  
tions were diligently renewed, but nothing could  
be seen worthy of note
