**BY EMILY R. PAGE.**<br/>
<br/>
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,  <br/>
And the waters below look dark and deep;  <br/>
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  <br/>
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  <br/>
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  <br/>
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  <br/>
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day thro&#x27;,  <br/>
Lies at its mooring, the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  <br/>
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lopped,  <br/>
And crossed on the railing one o&#x27;er one,  <br/>
Like folded hands when the work is done;  <br/>
While busily back and forth between,  <br/>
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  <br/>
And the solemn owl with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  <br/>
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  <br/>
Rots slowly away, in its living grave;  <br/>
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  <br/>
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  <br/>
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  <br/>
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;  <br/>
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  <br/>
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
The current waters are dead and still,  <br/>
But the light winds play with the boat at will;  <br/>
And lazily in and out again,  <br/>
It floats the length of the rusty chain,  <br/>
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  <br/>
That meet and part at the noontide chime;  <br/>
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew  <br/>
By the dipping bow of the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  <br/>
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  <br/>
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  <br/>
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,  <br/>
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  <br/>
And looked below in the broken tide,  <br/>
To see that the faces and boats were two,  <br/>
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
But now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  <br/>
And look below in the sluggish tide,  <br/>
The face that I see there is graver grown,  <br/>
And the laugh that I hear has a sobered tone,  <br/>
And the hand that lent to the light skiff wings  <br/>
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  <br/>
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  <br/>
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,  <br/>
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green moss grew,  <br/>
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.<br/>

THE OLD CANOE.<br/>
<br/>
BY MISS EMILY 3B. PAGE.<br/>
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,<br/>
And the waters below look dark and deep,<br/>
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,<br/>
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;<br/>
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,<br/>
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;<br/>
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through—<br/>
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
The useless paddies are idly dropped,<br/>
<br/>
Like a sea-bird’s wing that the storm has lopped,<br/>
And crossed on the railing one o’er one,<br/>
<br/>
Like the folded hands when the work is done;<br/>
While busily back and forth between,<br/>
<br/>
The spider stretches his silvery screen,<br/>
<br/>
And the solemn ow), with his dull ‘ too-hoo,’<br/>
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,<br/>
<br/>
Rots slowly away in its living grave,<br/>
<br/>
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,<br/>
Hiding the mouldering dust away,<br/>
<br/>
Like the hand that piants o’er the tomb a flower,<br/>
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower ;<br/>
<br/>
While many a blossom of loveliest hue<br/>
<br/>
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
The currentless waters are dead and still—<br/>
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,<br/>
And lazily in and out again,<br/>
<br/>
It floats the length of its rusty chain,<br/>
<br/>
Like the weary march of the hands of time,<br/>
That meet and part at the noontide chime ;<br/>
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,<br/>
By the Gripping bow of the old cance.<br/>
<br/>
O, many a time, with a careless hand,<br/>
<br/>
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,<br/>
<br/>
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick—<br/>
Where the whirls are wild, and the eddies are thick—<br/>
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,<br/>
<br/>
And looked below in the broken tide,<br/>
<br/>
To see that the faces and boats were two,<br/>
<br/>
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,<br/>
And look below in the sluggish tide,<br/>
The face that I see there is graver grown,<br/>
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,<br/>
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,<br/>
Have grown familiar with sterner things.<br/>
But I love to think of the hours that flew,<br/>
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,<br/>
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew<br/>

THE OLD CANOE.<br/>
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is<br/>
steep,<br/>
And the waters below look dark and deep,<br/>
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,<br/>
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;<br/>
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank<br/>
And the weeds grow thick on thewindingbank;<br/>
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day<br/>
through<br/>
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.<br/>
The useless paddles are idly dropped,<br/>
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has<br/>
looped.<br/>
And crossed on the railing one o&#x27;er one,<br/>
Like the folded hands when the work is done;<br/>
While busily hack and forth between,<br/>
The spider stretches his silvery screen,<br/>
And the solemn owl, with its dull &#x27;&quot;too-too,<br/>
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.<br/>
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,<br/>
Rots slowly away in its living grave,<br/>
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull de.<br/>
cay,<br/>
Hiding its mouldering dust away,<br/>
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a<br/>
flower,<br/>
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;<br/>
While many a blossom of loveliest hue.<br/>
Springs up o&#x27;er the stem of the old canoe.<br/>
The currentles3 waves are dead and still-<br/>
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,<br/>
And lazily in and out again<br/>
It floats the length of the rusty chain,<br/>
Like the weary march of the hands of time,<br/>
That meets and part at the noontide chime,<br/>
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,<br/>

Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are<br/>

And laughed as 1 leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,<br/>
And looked below in the broken tide,<br/>
To see that the faces and boats were two,<br/>
That were mirrored back from the old cauoe.<br/>

And now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,<br/>
And look below in the sluggish tide,<br/>
The face that I see there is graver grown,<br/>
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,<br/>
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings<br/>
Have grown familiar with sterner things.<br/>
But I love to think of the hours that flew<br/>

THE C1Z) CANOE.<br/>
The following little poem is from the pen<br/>
of Albert Pike. Wc give it as a sample of<br/>
elegant diction and graceful rythin :<br/>
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep.<br/>
And the waters below look dark and deep.<br/>
Where the rugged rine in its lonely pride<br/>
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;<br/>
Where the reeds and rushes ars tall and rank,<br/>
Where the weeds grow thick on the winding bank,<br/>
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through.<br/>
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.<br/>
Tre useless paddles are idly dropped.<br/>
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s w ings that the storm bath stopped.<br/>
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one.<br/>
Like folded hands when tha work is done ;<br/>
While busily back and forth between,<br/>
The spider stretches his silver screen.<br/>
And the sclemn owl, with his dull &quot; too-whoo,&quot;<br/>
Restless down on the side of the old canoe.<br/>
The stern half sank in the imy wave.<br/>
Hots slowly awoj in its hidden grave ;<br/>
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay.<br/>
Hiding the mouldering pact away,<br/>
Like the hand tuat plants o&#x27;er the tomb a Cower,<br/>
Or the ivy that mantles a fallen tower,<br/>
While many a blossom of liveliest hue<br/>
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.<br/>
The currentless waves are dead and still,<br/>
But the light winds play with the boat at will<br/>
And lazily in and out again.<br/>
It floats the length of iu rusty chain,<br/>
Like the veary march of the hands of time,<br/>
That meet aud part at the ntontide chime,<br/>
And the shcre is kissed at each turn anew<br/>
By the dipping bow of the old cauoe.<br/>
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,<br/>
I have pushed it away frm the pebbly strand<br/>
And paddled it down where the stream ran quick,<br/>
When the whirls ere wild and the storm was thick<br/>
And laughed, as I leaned on the rocking Bide,<br/>
And lovkei1 below in the broken tide.<br/>
To see that the faces aud boats were two,<br/>
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.<br/>
But now, as I lean on the crumbling side<br/>
And iouk oelow in the sluggish tide,<br/>
The face that I see is graver grown,<br/>
And the laugh that I hear has a Sober tone.<br/>
And the hand that leut to the light skiff wings,<br/>

The Old Canoe—Emily Rebecca Page<br/>
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,<br/>

Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;<br/>
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank,<br/>

Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,<br/>
Lies at the moorings the old canoe.<br/>

Settles down on the sides of the old canoe.<br/>

<br/>
Rots slowly in its living grave,<br/>

And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,<br/>
Hiding the mouldering dust away,<br/>

Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;<br/>

While many a blossom of the loveliest hue<br/>

Leans gloomily over the murky tide,<br/>
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,<br/>
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank,<br/>
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day<br/>
<br/>
through,<br/>
There lies at its moorings the old canoe.<br/>
The useless paddles are idly dropped.<br/>
Like seabird’s wings that the storms had lopped,<br/>
And crossed on the railing one o’er one,<br/>
Like the folded hands when the work is done,<br/>
While busily back and forth between<br/>
The spider stretches his silvery screen,<br/>
And the solemn owl, with his dull “too-hoo,”<br/>
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
Th« stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,<br/>
Rots slowly away in its living grave,<br/>
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,<br/>
Hiding its mol’dring dust away,<br/>
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,<br/>
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;<br/>
While many a blossom of loveliest hue<br/>
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
The currentless waters are dead and still,<br/>
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,<br/>
And lazily in and out again<br/>
It floats the lengths of the rusty chain.<br/>
Like the weary march of the hands of time,<br/>
That meet and part at the noontide chime;<br/>
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,<br/>
*By the rippling bow of the old canoe.<br/>
<br/>
•Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,<br/>
T have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,<br/>
And paddled it down where the stream runs<br/>
quick,<br/>
Where the whirls are wide and the eddies are<br/>
<br/>
thick,<br/>
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocky side,<br/>
And looked below in the broken tide,<br/>
To see that the faces and boats were two,<br/>
That where mirrored back from the old canoe,<br/>
<br/>
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,<br/>
And look below in the sluggish tide,<br/>
The face that I see there is graver grown,<br/>
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,<br/>
And the hands that lend to the light skiff wings,<br/>
Have grown familiar with sterner things;<br/>
But I love to think of the hours that sped<br/>
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray<br/>
<br/>
shed,<br/>
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew<br/>

AN OLD CANOE.<br/>
By Albert Pike.<br/>
Where the rooks are gray and tho shore is<br/>
steep.<br/>
And the waters below look dark and deep.<br/>
Where the rugged pine, in its lonoly pride,<br/>
Leans gloomily over the murky tide,<br/>
Where the reed sand rushes are long and<br/>
rank.<br/>
And the weeds grow thick on the winding<br/>
bank,<br/>
Whore the shadow is heavy the whole day<br/>
through,<br/>
There lies ut its moorings the old canoe.<br/>
i<br/>
The useless paddles are idly dropped,<br/>
Like seabird’s wings that storms had<br/>
lopped,<br/>
And cross,d on the railing one o’er one<br/>
Like the folded hands when the work is<br/>
done,<br/>
While busily back and forth between<br/>
Ttie spider stretches his silvery screen,<br/>
And tho solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too­<br/>
hoo’’<br/>
Settles down on the s^de of the old canoe.<br/>
The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave<br/>
Rots slowly away in its living grave,<br/>
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er Its dull de­<br/>
cay,<br/>
Hiding its moulding dust away.<br/>
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a<br/>
flower<br/>
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;<br/>
While many a blossom of loveliest hue<br/>
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.<br/>
The currentless waters are dead and still<br/>
But the light wind plays with the boat at<br/>
’ will.<br/>
And lazily in and out again<br/>
It floats the length of the rusty chain.<br/>
Like the weary march of the hands of time,<br/>
That meet end part at the noontide chime;<br/>
And the shore is kissed at each turning<br/>
anew,<br/>
By the dripping bow of the old canoe. ^<br/>
