this outburst. He had the stoic’s capacity for keeping quiet under provocation, as he had demonstrated at the Cockpit; could the attack on him there have evoked this self-glorifying reply? The answer depends on one’s view of the man. The conventional view is that he was cool, detached, above the hurt and anger that afflict less disciplined mortals. But his papers give occasional strong hints that his discipline was vulnerable, and that anger could at times raise hob with detachment. If we are right in our guess that he wrote this letter, it is one more indication that he was less Olympian than commonly supposed.  
  
To the Printer of the Public Advertiser.  
Sir,  
The Admirers of Dr. Franklin in England are much shocked at Mr. Wedderburne’s calling him a Thief; but perhaps they will be less surprised at this Circumstance when they are informed, that his greatest Admirers on the Continent agree in entertaining the same Idea of him. As an Evidence of this, I send you a Copy of a poetical Stanza, which is engraved under his Portrait prefixed to the late French Translation of his Work, in two Volumes, Quarto.  
  
I shall also send you an Attempt of a Translation of them, that the English Reader may be able to judge of the Similarity between the Idea of Mr. Wedderburne and that of the French Philosopher, with whom all the Philosophers in Europe intirely concur. It will even be seen that Foreigners represent him as much more impudent and audacious in his Thefts than the English Orator (though he was under no Restraint from a Regard to Truth) has ventured to insinuate. I am, Sir, Your humble Servant,  
Homo Trium Literarum.  
  
Il a ravi le feu des cieux,  
Il fait fleurir les arts en des climats sauvages.  
L’Amerique le place a la tête des sages,  
La Grece l’auroit mis au nombre de ses Dieux.  
In English.  
To steal from Heaven its sacred Fire he taught,  
The Arts to thrive in savage Climes he brought:  
In the New World the first of Men esteem’d;  
Among the Greeks a God he had been deem’d
