ds; for no more can be thrown into the upper Part, when no more can be driven out of the lower Part. If you attempt to throw more in, it is spued back thro’ the Wire, or flies out in loud Cracks thro’ the Sides of the Bottle.  
3 The Equilibrium can not be restored in the Bottle by inward Communication, or Contact of the Parts; but it must be done by a Communication form’d without the Bottle, between the Top and Bottom, by some Non-electric touching both at the same Time. In which Case, if the Contact be large especially, it is restored with a Violence and Quickness inexpressible; or touching each alternately, in which Case the Equilibrium is restored by Degrees.  
4 As no more Electrical Fire can be thrown into the Top of the Bottle, when all is driven out of the Bottom. So in a Bottle not yet electrised, none can be thrown into the Top, when none can get out of the Bottom; which happens either when the Bottom is too thick, or when the Bottle is placed on an Electric-per-se. Again, when the Bottle is electrised, but little of the Electrical Fire can be drawn out from the Top, by touching the Wire, unless an equal Quantity can at the same Time get in at the Bottom. Thus place an Electris’d Bottle on clean Glass or dry Wax, and you will not, by touching the Wire, get out the Fire from the Top. Place it on a Non-electric, and touch the Wire, you will get it out in a short Time; but soonest, when you form a direct Communication, as above.  
So wonderfully are these two States of Electricity, the plus and minus combined and ballanced in this miraculous Bottle! situated and related to each other in a Manner that I can by no Means comprehend! If it were possible that a Bottle should in one Part contain a Quantity of Air strongly comprest, and in another Part a perfect Vacuum; We know the Equilibrium would be instantly restored within. But here we have a Bottle, containing at the same Time a Plenum of Electrical Fire and a Vacuum of the same Fire; and yet the Equilibrium can not be restored between them but by a Communication without! Tho’ the Plenum presses violently to expand, and the hungry Vacuum seems to attract as violently in Order to be filled.

brock.. He. remarks, 1. That the non-eleétric contained in  
the bottle, is different, when electrifed, from a non-eletric  
eleétrifed out of the bottle; the eleétrical fire of the latter  
being accumulated on its furface, and‘forms an electrical at-  
mofphere round it of confiderable extent; but the electrical  
fire is crouded into the glafs which contains the former.  
  
2.. That at the:fame tune, when the wire, and top of the  
  
bottle, &amp;c. are ele€trifed pofitively or plus, the bottom of the  
bottle is electrifed negatively or minus, in exact proportion :  
ie. whatever quantity of electrical fire is thrown in at the top,  
an equal quantity goes out atthe bottom. And when all that  
was contained in the bottom is driven out, no more can be  
thrown in at the top; for if you attempt to throw more in, it  
returns back through the wire, or flies out in loud cracks  
through the fides of the bottle.  
- 3+ That the equilibrium cannot be reftored in the bottle by  
inward communication or contaét of the parts; but it muft  
be done by a communication formed without the bottle be-  
tween the top and the bottom, by fame non-electric touching  
both at the fame time.  
  
4. That as no eleétrical fire can be thrown into the top of  
the bottle, when all is driven out of the bottom; foina  
bottle not yet eleG&amp;rifed, none can be thrown in at the top,  
when none can get out at the bottom; which happens either  
when the bottom is too thick, or when the bottle is placed  
on an electric per fe. Alfo when the bottom is electrifed, but  
little of the eleétrical fire can be drawn out from the top, by

‘ So wonderful, fays our author, are thefe two ftates of  
electricity, the plus and the minus, combined and baianced  
in this miraculous bottle! fituated and related to each other  
in a manner that I can by no means comprehend ! If it  
were poflible that a bottle fhould in one part contain a quan-  
tity of air itrongly comprefled, and in another part a perfeét  
vacuum, we know the equilibrium would be inftantly re-  
ftored within. But here we have a bottle, containing at the  
fame time a plenum of eleétrical fire, and a vacuum of the  
fame fire; and yet the equilibrium cannot be reftored_be-  
tween them but by a communication witheut / tho’.the pie-  
num prefles violently to expand, and the bungry vacuum  
feems to attract as violently in orcer to be filled.’

nomena of electrical condensation, and Muschenbroek had con-  
structed the Leyden jar. The experiments of Franklin, made in  
1747, showed that ‘‘ at the same time that the wire and top (inside)  
of the bottle is electrified positively or plus, the bottom of the bottle  
(outside) is electrified negatively or minus in exact proportion; 7. ¢.,  
whatever quantity of electrical fire is thrown in at top, an equal  
quantity goes ouf of the bottom.’’ ‘‘ None can be thrown into  
the top when none can get out at the bottom.’’.... ‘‘ Again,  
when the bottle is electrified, but little of the electrical fire can be  
drawn out at the top by touching the wire unless an equal quantity  
can at the same time ge¢ iw at the bottom.’’ By these and si” ilar  
experiments he completely analyzed the phenomena in question.  
He continues: ‘* So wonderfully are these two states of electricity,  
the A/us and minus, combined and balanced in this miraculous bot-
