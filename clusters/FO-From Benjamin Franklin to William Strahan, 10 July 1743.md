Mr. Read has communicated to me part of a Letter from you, recommending a young Man whom you would be glad to see in better Business than that of a Journeyman Printer. I have already three Printing-Houses in three different Colonies, and purpose to set up a fourth if I can meet with a proper Person to manage it, having all Materials ready for that purpose. If the young Man will venture over hither, that I may see and be acquainted with him, we can treat about the Affair, and I make no doubt but he will think my Proposals reasonable; If we should not agree, I promise him however a Twelvemonths Good Work, and to defray his Passage back if he enclines to return to England. I am Sir, Your humble Servant unknown

Sir, — Mr. Read has communicated  
to me part of a Letter from you, recom-  
mending a young Man whom you would  
be glad to see in better Business than

already three Printing Houses in three  
different colonies, and purpose to set up  
a fourth if I can meet with a proper  
Person to manage it, having all Mate-  
rials ready for that purpose. If the  
young Man will venture over hither,  
that I may see and be acquainted with  
him, we can treat about the Affair, and  
I make no doubt but he will think my  
Proposals reasonable ; If we should not  
agree, I promise him however a Twelve  
months Good Work, and to defray his  
Passage back if he enclines to return to  
England. Iam, Sir,  
  
Your humb Servt. unknown
