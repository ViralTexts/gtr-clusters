As Lord Hillsborough in fact got nothing out of me, I should rather suppose he threw me away as an orange that would yield no juice, and therefore not worth more squeezing. When I had been a little while returned to London I waited on him to thank him for his civilities in Ireland, and to discourse with him on a Georgia affair. The porter told me he was not at home. I left my card, went another time, and received the same answer, though I knew he was at home, a friend of mine being with him. After intermissions of a week each, I made two more visits, and received the same answer. The last time was on a levee day, when a number of carriages were at his door. My coachman driving up, alighted and was opening the coach door, when the porter, seeing me, came out, and surlily chid the coachman for opening the door before he had enquired whether my lord was at home; and then turning to me, said, “My Lord is not at home.” I have never since been nigh him, and we have only abused one another at a distance. The contrast as you observe is very striking between his conversation with the Chief Justice, and his letter to you concerning your province. I know him to be as double and deceitful as any man I ever met with. But we have don

ber of carriages at the door. Franklin&#x27;s coach-  
man drove up, alighted, and was opening the  
carriage for Franklin to dismount, when the port-  
er came out, and in the most supercilious and  
surly manner rebuked the coachman for opening  
  
the door of the carnage before he had inquirea  
whether his lordship was at home; and then  
turning to Franklin he said, ‘‘ My lord is not at  
home.”  
  
Lord Hillsborough, however, recovered from  
his resentment after this, in the course of a year ;  
and at length on one occasion his lordship called

Dear SoN:As Lord Wellsborough  
in fact got nothing out of me, I should rather  
suppose he threw me away as an orange that  
would yield no juice, and, therefore, not worth  
more squeezing. When I had been a little while  
returned to London I waited on him to thank  
him for his civilities in Ireland, and to dis­  
course with him on a Georgia affair. The por.­  
ter told me he was not at home. I left my card  
went another time, and received the same an­  
swer, though I knew he was at home, a friend  
of mine being with him. Afterintermissions of  
a week each I made two more visits and re­  
ceived the same answer. The last time was on  
a levee day, when a number of carriages were  
at his door. My coachman, driving up, alighted  
and was opening the coach door, when the por.­  
ter, seeing me, came out and surlily chid the  
coachman for opening the door before he had  
inquired whether my lord was at home; and  
then turning to me said, &quot;My lord is not at  
home.&quot; I have never since been nigh him, and  
we have only abused one another at a dis­  
tance.  Yours, &amp;c.. B. FranelIN,
