Dear Child  
Philadelphia, February 22, 1756.  
I condole with you, we have lost a most dear and valuable relation, but it is the will of God and Nature that these mortal bodies be laid aside, when the soul is to enter into real life; ’tis rather an embrio state, a preparation for living; a man is not completely born until he be dead: Why then should we grieve that a new child is born among the immortals? A new member added to their happy society? We are spirits. That bodies should be lent us, while they can afford us pleasure, assist us in acquiring knowledge, or doing good to our fellow creatures, is a kind and benevolent act of God—when they become unfit for these purposes and afford us pain instead of pleasure—instead of an aid, become an incumbrance and answer none of the intentions for which they were given, it is equally kind and benevolent that a way is provided by which we may get rid of them. Death is that way. We ourselves prudently choose a partial death. In some cases a mangled painful limb, which cannot be restored, we willingly cut off. He who plucks out a tooth, parts with it freely since the pain goes with it, and he that quits the whole body, parts at once with all pains and possibilities of pains and diseases it was liable to, or capable of making him suffer.  
Our friend and we are invited abroad on a party of pleasure—that is to last for ever. His chair was first ready and he is gone before us. We could not all conveniently start together, and why should you and I be grieved at this, since we are soon to follow, and we know where to find him. Adieu.

Dear Child : I condole with yon.  
We have lost a most dear and valuable  
relation, but it is the will of God and  
nature that these mortal bodies be laid  
aside when the soul is to enter into real  
life. Existing here on earth is scarcely  
to be called life. &#x27;Tis rather an embryo  
state a preparation to living, and man  
is not completely born until he is dead.  
Why, then, should we grieve that a new  
child is born among the immortal a  
new member added to their society. We  
are spirits. That bodies should, be lent  
to us while they can afford us pleasure,  
assist us in acquiring knowledge, or in  
doing good to our fellow-creatures, is a  
kind and benevolent act of God. When  
they become unfit for their purposes, and  
afford us pain instead of pleasure, instead  
of an aid become an incumbrance, and  
answer none of the intentions for which  
they were given, it is equally kind and  
benevolent that a way is provided by  
which we may get rid of them. That  
way is death. We ourselves prudently,  
ia some cases, choose a partial death. A  
mangled, painful limb, which cannot be  
restored, we willingly cut off. He that  
plucks out a tooth parts with it freely,  
since the pain goes with it ; and he that j  
quits the whole body parts with all pains j  
and possibility of pains and diseases it  
was liable to or capable of making him

ry —Puiladelphia, Feb. 12, 1756.—Dear Cid:  
I condule with you. We have lost a most dear  
and valuable reiation, but it is the will of God  
and nature that these mortal bodies be laid aside  
when the soul is to enter into real life. Existing  
here on earth is scarcely to called lite. ’ Tis  
rather an embryo state—a Fh Sor to living,  
and man is not completely born\until he is dead.  
Why, then, should we grieve tnat a new child is  
born among the immortals—a new member added  
to their society? We are spirits. (hat bodies  
should be lent to us while they can afford us pleas-  
ure, assist us in acquiring kuowledge, or in doing  
good to our fellow-creatures, is a kind and benevo-  
lent act of God. When they become unfit tor  
their purposes, and afford us pain instead of pleas  
ure, instead of-an aid become an incumbrance, and  
answer none of the intentions tor which they were  
ziven, it is equally kind and benevolent that a way  
is provided by which we may get til of them.  
Chat way is death. We ourselves prulently, in  
some cases, choose a partial death. A mangled,  
paintul hmb, which cannot be restored, we will-  
inzly cut off. He that plucks out a tooth paris  
with it freely since the pain goes with it; and  
he that quits the whole body parts with all pains,  
and possibility of pains aud diseases, it was liable  
to or capable of making him suffer. Our triend  
and we are invited abroad ona party ot pleasure  
that is to last forever. His chair |sedan-ciairs  
were then common] was tirst ready, and he has |  
sgone before us. We could not conveniently all  
start to_ether, and why should you and I be  
grieved at this, since we are svon to tollow, and  
we know where to tind uim?

We have lost a most dear and valuable .  
relation. But it is the will of God and  
Nature that these mortal &#x27; bodies be laid  
aside when the soul is to enter real life.  
This is rather an embryo state, a prepara­

born until be is doad. Why should we  
grieve when a new child is born to the  
immortals ?, We are spirits; that bodies  
should be lent us while, they can afford  
us pleasure, assist us in acquiring knowl­  
edge, or doing good to ourfellow-creatures,  
is a kind and benevolent act of God.  
When they become unfit for these pur-  
poses, and afford us pain instead of pleas­  
ureinstead of aid bocome an incum­  
brance, and answer none of the intentions  
for which they wore given it is equally  
kind and benevolent that a way is provided  
by which we may get rid of them.  
Death is that way. We ourselves, in  
some cases, prudently choose a partial  
death. A mangled, painful limb, which  
cannot be restored, we willingly cut off.  
He who plucks out a tooth parts with it  
freoly, since pain goes with it ; and he  
who quits the whole body, parts at once  
with all the pains and diseases it was lia­  
ble to or capable of making.  
Our friend and we were invited abroad  
on a party of pleasure which is to last for­  
ever. His chair was ready firat, and he  
had gone before us; we could not conve­  
niently start together. Why should you
