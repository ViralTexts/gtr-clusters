I received your friendly Letter of the 7th. Inst. I am glad my Letters respecting the Aerostatic Experiment were not unacceptable. But as more perfect Accounts of the Construction and Management of that Machine have been and will be published before your Transactions, and from which Extracts may be made that will be more particular and therefore more satisfactory, I think it best not to print those letters. I say this in answer to your Question: for I did not indeed write them with a view of their being inserted. Mr. Faujas de St. Fond

As the Flame slackens, the rarified Air cools and condenses, the Bulk of the Balloon diminishes and it begins to descend. If those in the Gallery see it likely to descend in an improper Place, they can by throwing on more Straw, &amp; renewing the Flame, make it rise again, and the Wind carries it farther.  
La Machine poussée par le Vent s’est dirigée sur une des Allées du Jardin. That is against the Trees of one of the Walks. The Gallery hitched among the top Boughs of those Trees which had been cut and were stiff, while the Body of the Balloon lean’d beyond and seemed likely to overset. I was then in great Pain for the Men, thinking them in danger of being thrown out, or burnt, for I expected that the Balloon being no longer upright, the Flame would have laid hold of the inside that

It was well that in the hurry of so hazardous an Experiment, the Flame did not happen by any accidental Mismanagement to lay hold of this Straw; tho’ each had a Bucket of Water by him, by Way of Precaution.  
One of these courageous Philosophers, the Marquis d’Arlandes, did me the honour to call upon me in the Evening after the Experiment with Mr. Montgolfier the very ingenious Inventor. I was happy to see him safe. He informed me they lit gently without the least Shock, and the Balloon was very little damaged.  
This Method of filling the Balloon with hot Air is cheap and expeditious, and it is

There is room in this Car for a little Table to be placed between them, on which they can write and keep their Journal, that is, take Notes of every thing they observe, the State of their Thermometer, Barometer, Hygrometer &amp;c which they will have more leisure to do than the others, having no fire to

y we are not so much afraid of being laught at. If we do a foolish Thing, we are the first to laugh at it ourselves, and are almost as much pleased with a Bon Mot or a good Chanson, that ridicules well the Disappointment of a Project, as we might have been with its Success. It does not seem to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new Experiment which apparently increases the Power of Man over Matter, till we can see to what  
  
Use that Power may be applied. When we have learnt to manage it, we may hope some time or other to find Uses for it, as Men have done for Magnetism and Electricity, of which the first Experiments were mere Matters of Amusement.  
This Experiment is by no means a trifling one. It may be attended with important Consequences that no one can foresee. We should not suffer Pride to prevent our progress in Science. Beings of a Rank and Nature far Superior to ours have not disdained to amuse themselves with making and launching Balloons, otherwise we should never have enjoyed the Light of those glorious Objects that rule our Day &amp; Night,

DEAR Sir: Your friendly letter of the 7th of Mareh  
has been received by me, and I am glad to see that ny  
account of the aerostatic experiment seems to have in  
terested you. But as there has already been published.  
and there is yet to be published, in advance of your  
memoir, a completer report on the construction and  
handling of this apparatus, and as extracts from that  
might be made in a preciser and consequently a more  
satisfactory manner, I think it preferable not to print  
my letters. I say this in answer to your question, for  
I certainly did not write them with a view to publica.

that allowed him to throw bundles of straw into the  
fireplace in order to keep up the fire and keep the bal-  
loon full. When the latter passed over our heads, we  
could see the fire, of which there was a considerable  
quantity. In measure as the flames diminish, the rare  
and condenses, the size of the  
balloon diminishes, and it begins to descend. If the  
persons in the gallery see that they are going to descend  
in an unfavorable place, they can, by throwing in some  
straw, quicken the flames and rise again, and the wi  
will carry them further along. :  
  
The machine, impelled by the wind, took its court  
over one of the garden walks, that is to say, against t  
trees of one of the avenues. The gallery got caught in the  
upper branches of these trees, which had just been trim-  
med and were very stiff, while the body of the balloon  
leaned over and seemed as if it must turn upside dow2.  
I was then anxious as to the fate of the aeronauts, feat  
ing lest I might see them fall out or be burned, for.  
since the balloon was no longer upright, it was poy  
for the flames to set fire internally to the fabric, whi  
hung just above. But, by means of ropes, whieh were  
still fastened to it, it was soon possible to right the ba

here was a great throng of people of rank in the|  
Muette garden. Every one was delighted that every-,|  
thing passed off so merrily, and applauded by a clap-  
ping of hands ; but, at the same time, great anxiety  
  
was felt for the safety of the travelers.  
  
A great crowd in Paris saw the balloon pass, but no  
one knew that there were men it, since it had risen so  
high they could not be perceived.  
  
Developing the Gas.—This, in good English, signifies

which the balloon is inflated, I suppose it is simply hot

tween the two nations as that which exists here be-  
tween the two parties. Your scientists seem to be too  
timid. In this country weare not afraid to have any  
one laugh at us. If we do a senseless thing, we are the  
first to make fun of it, and we are as satisfied with a  
witticism or a good song that well ridicules the failure  
of a project as we would be with its success.  
  
It does not seem to me to be good reasoning to refuse  
to pursue a new experiment calculated to increase the  
power of man over matter, as long as we have not  
been able to ascertain the use to which such power  
will have been able to be applied. When we have  
learned how to use it, we ought to hope to find an ap-  
plication for it some day or other, as man has done for  
magnetism and electricity, which, at first, were subjects  
for amusement.  
  
This Muette experiment is certainly not insignificant.  
It may have consequences of which no one can foresee  
the importance. We ought not to allow pride to stop  
our progress.  
  
Beings of a condition superior to our own have not  
disdained to make and send forth balloons, otherwise
