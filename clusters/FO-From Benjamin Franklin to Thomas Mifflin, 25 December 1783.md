It was certainly disagreable to the English Ministers that all their Treaties for Peace were carried on under the Eye of the French Court. This began to appear towards the Conclusion, when Mr Hartley refused going to Versailles to sign there with the other Powers our Definitive Treaty, and insisted on its being done at Paris, which we in good Humour complied with, but at an earlier Hour, that we might have time to acquaint le  
  
Comte de Vergennes before he was to sign with the Duke of Manchester. The Dutch Definitive was not then ready, and the British Court now insists on finishing it either at London or the Hague. If therefore the Commission to us, which has been so long de

With respect to the British Court, we should I think be constantly upon our guard, and impress strongly upon our Minds, that tho’ it has made Peace with us, it is not in Truth reconciled either to us or to its Loss of us; but still flatters itself with Hopes that some Change in the Affairs of Europe or some Disunion among ourselves, may afford them an Opportunity of Recovering their Dominion, punishing those who have most offended, and securing our future Dependance. It is easy to see by the general Turn of the Ministerial News-Papers; (light Things indeed as Straws and Feathers, but like them they show which way the Wind blows) and by the malignant Improvement their Ministers make in all the Foreign Courts, of every little Accident or Dissension among us, the Riot of a few Soldiers at Philadelphia, the Resolves of some Town Meetings, the Reluctance to pay Taxes &amp;ca &amp;ca all which are exaggerated to represent our Governments as so many Anarchies, of which the People themselves are weary, the Congress as having lost its Influence being no longer respected: I say it is easy to see from this Conduct that they bear us no Good Will, and that they wish the Reality of what they are pleased to imagine. They have too a numerous Royal Progeny to provide for, some of whom are educated in the Military Line. In these Circumstances we cannot be too careful to preserve the Friendships we have acquired abroad, and the Union we have establish’d at Home, to secure our Credit by a punctual Discharge of our Obligations of every kind, and our Reputation by the Wisdom of our Councils:  
  
Since we know not how soon we may have a fresh Occasion for Friends, for Credit and for Reputation.
