y dear Friend,  
Passy, Sept. 11. 1783.—  
  
Mr Storer told me not long since that you complain’d of my not writing to you. You had reason; for I find among your  
Letters to me two unanswered, viz. those of May 25, and Dec. 17. 1781. The Truth is, I have had too much Business to do  
for the Publick, and too little Help allow’d me; so that it became impossible for me to  
keep up my private Correspondencies. I promis’d myself more Leisure when the Definitive  
Treaty of Peace should be concluded: But that it seems is to be followed by a Treaty of  
Commerce, which will probably take up a good deal of Time &amp; require much Attention.  
I seize this little Interim to sit down &amp; have a little Chat with my Friends in  
America.—  
I lament with you the many Mischiefs, the Injustices, the Corruption of Manners, &amp;c  
&amp;c that attended a depreciating Currency. It is some Consolation to me that I wash’d  
my Hands of that Evil by predicting it in Congress, and proposing Means that would have  
been effectual to prevent it if they had been adopted. Subsequent Operations that I have executed,  
demonstrate that my Plan was practicable. But it was unfortunately rejected. Considering  
all our Mistakes and Mismanagements, it is wonderful we have finish’d our Affair so  
well, and so soon! Indeed I am wrong in using that Expression, We have finish’d our Affairs so well. Our  
Blunders have been many, and they serve to manifest the Hand of Providence more clearly  
in our Favour; so that we may much more properly say, These are  
THY Doings, O Lord, and they are marvellous in  
our Eyes!—  
Mr. Storer, whom you recommended to me is now in England. He needed none of the Advice  
you desired me to give him. His Behaviour here was unexceptionable, and he  
gain’d the Esteem of all that knew him.—  
The Epitaph on my dear and much esteemed young Friend, is too well written to be  
capable of Improvement by any Corrections of mine.— Your Moderation appears in it, since  
the natural Affection of a Parent has not induc’d you to exaggerate his Virtues. I shall  
always mourn his Loss with you; a Loss not easily made up to his Country.  
How differently constituted was his noble and generous Mind from that of the miserable  
Calumniators you mention! Having Plenty of Merit in himself, he was not jealous of the  
Appearance of Merit in others, but did Justice to their Characters with as much Pleasure  
as these People do Injury. It is now near two Years since your Friendship induc’d you to  
acquaint me with some of their Accusations. I guess’d easily at the Quarter from whence  
they came; but conscious of my Innocence, and unwilling to disturb public Operations by  
private Resentments or Contentions, I pass’d them over in Silence; and have not till  
within these few days taken the least Step towards my Vindication. Inform’d that the  
Practice of abusing me continues, and that some heavy Charges are lately made against me  
respecting my Conduct in the Treaty, written from Paris and propagated among you; I have  
demanded of all my Colleagues that they do me Justice, and I have no doubt of receiving  
it, from each of them.— I did not think it necessary to justify my self to you; by  
answering the Calumnies you mention’d. I knew you did not believe them. It was  
improbable that I should at this Distance combine with any body to urge the Redemption  
of the Paper on those unjust Terms, having no Interest in such Redemption. It was  
impossible that I should have traded with the Public Money, since I had not traded with  
any Money, either separately or jointly with any other Person, directly or indirectly to  
the Value of a Shilling, since my being in France. And the Fishery which it was said I  
had relinquished, had not then come in question, nor had I  
ever dropt a Syllable to that purpose in Word or Writing: but I was always firm in this  
Principle, that having had a common Right with the English to the Fisheries while  
connected with that Nation, and having contributed equally with our Blood and Treasure  
in conquering what had been gain’d from the French, we had an undoubted Right on  
breaking up our Partnership, to a fair Division.— As to the two Charges of Age and  
Weakness, I must confess the first; but I am not quite so clear in the latter; and  
perhaps my Adversaries may find that they presum’d a little too much upon it when they  
ventur’d to attack me.  
But enough of these petty Personalities. I quit them to rejoice with you in the Peace God has blest us with, and in the Prosperity it  
gives us a Prospect of. The Definitive Treaty was signed the third Instant. We are now  
Friends with England and with all Mankind. May we never see another War! for in my  
Opinion there never was a good War, or a bad Peace. Adieu,  
&amp; believe me ever, my dear Friend, Yours most affectionately  
  
B Franklin  
Honble. Josiah Quincey Esqe—
