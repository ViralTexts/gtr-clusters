Philada Febry. 19, 1776.  
I rejoice that you are going to Canada. I hope the Gout will not have the courage to follow you into that severe Climate. I believe you will have the Number of Men you wish for: I am told there will be 2,000 more: but there are always Deficiencies.  
The Bearer, Mr. Paine, has requested a Line of Introduction to you, which I give the more willingly, as I know his sentiments are not very different from yours. He is the reputed, and I think the real Author of Common Sense, a Pamphlet that has made great Impression here. I do not enlarge, both because he waits, and because I hope for the pleasure of conferring with you face to face in Canada. I will only add, that we are assured here on the part of France, that the Troops sent to the W. Indies, have no inimical views to us or our Cause. It is thought they intend a War without a previous Declaration. God prosper all your Undertakings, and return you with Health, Honour and Happiness. Yours most affectionately  
B Franklin

Dear Sir: I rejoice that you are going to Can-  
ada. I hope the gout will not have the courage  
to follow you into that severe climate. I believe  
you will have the number of men you wish for;  
  
am told that there will be 2000 more, but there  
are always deficiencies.  
  
The bearer, Mr. Paine, has requested a line of  
introduction to you, which I give the more will-  
ingly, as I know his sentiments are not very dif-  
ferent from yours. He is the reputed, and I think  
the real, author of Common Sense,” a pamphlet  
that has made great impression here. I do not en-  
large, both because he waits, and because I hope  
for the pleasure of conferring with you face to face  
in Canada. I will only add, that we are assured  
here, on the part of France, that the troops sent  
to the West Indies have no inimical views to us  
or our cause. It is thought they intend a war  
without a previous declaration. God prosper all  
your undertakings, and return you with health,  
honor, and happiness.  
  
Yours most affectionately.  
B, FRANKLIN.
