Passey, Augt. 19th. 1784  
  
I recieved your kind Letter of Apl. 17. You will have the goodness to place my delay in answering to the Account of Indisposition &amp; Business, &amp; excuse it. I have now that letter before me; and my Grandson whom you may formerly remember a little Scholar of Mr. Elphinson’s, purposing to set out in a day or two on a visit to his Father in London, I set down to scribble a little to you, first reccommending him as a worthy young Man to your Civilities and Counsels.  
You press me much to come to England; I am not without strong Inducements to do so; the Fund of Knowledge you promise to communicate to me is an Addition to them, and no small one. At present it is impracticable. But when my Grandson returns, come with him. We will then talk the matter over, and perhaps you may take me back with you. I have a Bed at your service, and will try to make your Residence, while you can stay with us, as agreeable to You if possible, as I am sure it will be to me.—

nest desire to have remained longer together.—  
You “fairly acknowledge that the late War terminated quite contrary to your Expectation.” Your expectation was ill founded; for you would not believe your old Friend, who told you repeatedly that by those Measures England would lose Her Colonies, as Epictetus warn’d in vain his Master that he would break his Leg. You believ’d rather the Tales you heard of our Poltronery &amp; Impotence of Body &amp; Mind. Do you not  
  
remember the Story you told me of the Scotch Serjeant, who met with a Party of Forty American Soldiers, and tho’ alone disarm’d them all and brought them in Prisoners: A Story almost as Improbable as that of the Irishman, who pretended to have alone taken and brought in Five of the Enemy, by surrounding them. And yet, my Friend, sensible and Judicious as you are, but partaking of the general Infatuation, you seemed to believe it.— The Word general puts me in mind of a General, your General Clarke, who had the Folly to say in my hearing at Sir John Pringle’s, that with a Thousand British Grenadiers he would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the Males partly by force and partly by a little Coaxing. It is plain he took us for a Species of Animals very little superior to Brutes. The Parliament too believ’d the Stories of another foolish General, I forget his Name, that the Yankies never felt bold. Yankey was understood to be a sort of Yahoo, and the Parliament did not think the Petitions of such Creatures were fit to be recieved and read in so wise an Assembly. What was the consequence of this monstrous Pride and Insolence? You first send small Armies to Subdue us, believing them more than sufficient, but soon found yourselves obliged to send greater; these whenever they ventured to penetrate our Country beyond the Protection of their Ships, were either repulsed and obliged to scamper out, or were surrounded, beaten, and taken Prisoners. An American Planter who had never seen Europe, was chosen by us to Command our Troops and continu’d during the whole War. This Man sent home to you, one after another, five of your best Generals, baffled, their Heads bare of Laurels, disgraced even in the Opinion of their Employers. Your Contempt of our Understandings in Comparison with your own appeared to be not much better founded than that of our Courage, if we may judge by this Circumstance, that in whatever Court of Europe a Yankey Negociator appeared, the wise British Minister was routed put in a passion, pick’d a  
  
quarrel with your Friends, &amp; was sent home with a Flea in his Ear.— But after all my dear Friend, do not imagine that I am vain enough to ascribe our Success to any superiority in any of those Points. I am too well acquainted with all the Springs and Levers of our Machine, not to see that our human means were unequal to our undertaking, and that if it had not been for the Justice of our Cause, and the consequent Interposition of Providence in which we had Faith we must have been ruined. If I had ever before been an Atheist I should now have been convinced of the Being and Government of a Deity. It is he who abases the Proud &amp; favors the Humble! May we never forget his Goodness to us, and may our future Conduct manifest our Gratitude.—  
But let us leave these serious Reflections and converse with our usual Pleasantry. I remember your observing once to me, as we sat together in the House of Commons, that no two Journeymen Printers within your Knowledge had met with such Success in the World as ourselves. You were then at the head of your Profession, and soon afterward became a Member of that Parliament. I was an Agent for a few Provinces and now act for them all. But we have risen by different Modes. I as a Republican Printer, always lik’d a Form well plaind down; being averse to those overbearing Letters that hold their Heads so high as to hinder their Neighbours from appearing. You as a Monarchist chose to work upon Crown Paper, and found it profitable; while I work’d upon Pro-patria (often indeed call’d Fools-Cap) with no less advantage. Both our Heaps hold out very well, and we seem likely to make a pretty good days Work of it. With regard to Public Affairs, (to continue in the same stile) it seems to me that the Compositors in your Chapel do not cast off their Copy well, nor perfectly understand Imposing. Their Forms too are continually pester’d by the Outs, and Doubles, that are not easy to be corrected. And I think they were wrong in laying aside some Faces, and particularly certain Head-pieces, that would have  
  
been both useful and ornamental. But, Courage! The Business may still flourish with good Management; &amp; the Master become as rich as any of the Company—  
By the way, the rapid Growth and extension of the English language in America, must become greatly Advantageous to the Booksellers, &amp; holders of Copy Rights in England. A vast audience is assembling there for English Authors, ancient, present and future, our People doubling every twenty Years; and this will demand large, and of course profitable, Impressions of your most valuable Books. I would therefore If I possessed such rights, entail them, if such a thing be practicable, upon my Posterity; for their Worth will be continually Augmenting. This may look a little like Advice, and yet I have drank no Madeira these Ten Months. The Subject however leads me to another thought, which is, that you do wrong to discourage th

the goodness to place my delay in answering to  
the account of indisp»sition and of business and  
excuse it. I have now the letter before me; and  
my grandson, whom you may formerly remember  
a little scholar at Mr. Elphinston’s, purposing to  
set out in a day or two, ona visit to his father in  
London, 1 set down to scribble a little to you  
first recommending him, as a worthy young man,  
to your civilities and counsels. ’  
  
You press me much to come to England. Iam  
not without strong inducements to do so; the  
fund of knowledge you promise to communicate  
to me, is an addition to them, and no small one.  
At present it is impracticable. But, when my  
grandson returns, come with him. We will talic  
the matter over, and perhaps you may take me  
back with you. I have a bed at your service, and  
will try to make your residence, while you can  
stay with us, as agreeable to you, if possible, as I

Lo Wiiliam Strahan, esqure, king’s printer, London.  
Pessy, August 19, 1784.—Deur friend,—You press  
  
me much to come to England. Iam not without  
  
strong inducements to do so; the fund of knowledge  
you promise to communicate to me, is an addition  
to them, and no smallone. At present it is imprac-  
ticable. But when my gradson returns, come with  
him. We will talk the matter over, and perhaps  
you may take me back with you. I have a bed at  
your service, and will try to make your residence,  
while you can stay with us, aS agreeable to you, if  
possible, as I am sure it will be to me

unequal to our undertaking; and that, if it had not  
been for the justice of our cause, and the conse-  
quent interposition of Providence, in which we had  
faith, we must have beenruined. If [had ever be-

vinced of the being and government of a Deity !—

ble. May we never forget his goodness to us, and  
may our future conduct manifest our gratitude !  
But let us leave these serious reflections, and  
converse with our usual pleasantry. I remember  
vour observing once to me, as we sat together in  
the house of commons, that no two journeymen  
printers within your knowledge, had met with such  
success in the world as ourselves. You were then  
at the head of your profession, and, soon after-  
wards became a member of parliament. I was an

hold their heads so Aigh as to hinder their neigh-  
bors from appearing. You as a monarchist, chose  
to work upon crown paper, and found it profitable;  
while I worked upon pro patria (often indeed called  
fools-cap_) with no less advantage. Both our heaps  
hold out very well, and we seem likely to make a  
pretty good day’s work of it. With regard to pub-  
lic affairs (to continue in the same style), it seems  
to me, that the compositors in your chapel do not  
cast off their copy well, nor prefectly understand  
imposing; their ferms too are continually pestered  
by the outs and doubles, that are not easy to be cor-  
reeted. And [ think they were wrong in laying  
asside some faces, and particularly certain head.

greatly advantageous to the booksellers and hold-

1 received your kind letter of Apr!  
17. You will have the goodness t.j  
place im delay in answering, to tlic  
account of indisposition iV of business,

scribble a little to you, first recom­  
mending him as a wnrtbyy oung man,  
to your civilities and counsels.  
You prejs me much to emue tc  
England. 1 am not without strong  
inducements to do so ; the fund oi  
knowledge you promise to communi­  
cate to me, is an addition to them, »\
no small one. At present if is im­

You “ fairly acknowledge that th&lt;  
last war terminated quite contran  
to your expectation.” Your expecta  
  
tion was ill founded j Tor you wouh  
not believe your old friend, win  
told you repeatedly, that, by tliosi  
measures, England would lose hri  
colonies, as Epictetus warned in &#x27;aii  
his master, that lie would break, hi  
log. You believed rather the talcs  
you heard of our poltroonery, and itn  
pOtence of body and mind. l)o yoi  
not remember the story you told me o  
the Scotch sergeant who met with ;  
party of forty American soldiers, am  
tho’ alone, disarmed them all, am  
brought them in prisoners ! A storj  
, almost as improbable as that of tin  
Irishman, who pretended to hav&lt;  
alone taken and brought in five of tin  
enemy, by surrounding them.—Am  
yet, my friend, sensible and judiciou;  
as you are, but partaking ol the ge  
neral infatuation, you seemed to be  
lieve it. The word general puts im  
in mind of a General, your Genera  
Chi k, who had the folly to say, in nn  
(hearing, at Sir John Pringle’s, tha

their heads bare of laurels, disgraced  
{even in the opinion of their employers,  
j Your contempt of our understanding,  
tin comparison with your own, appear­  
ed to he not murh hotter founded, than  
that of our courage, if wc may judg*  
by this circumstance, that in whatevci  
court of Europe a Yankee ncgociator  
appeared, put in a passion, picked a  
quarrel with your friends, and was  
sent home with a fVu in his ear. But  
alter all. my dear friend, do not ima­  
gine that 1 am vain enough to ascribe  
our success to any superiority in any  
•d’ those, points. I am too well ac­  
quainted with all the sp mgs and le­  
vel&#x27;s of our machine. not to see that  
our human means were unequal to our  
undertaking, and that if it had not  
been for the justice of our cause, and  
the consequent interposition of Provi­  
dence, in which we had faith.we must  
have been ruined. If I had ever been  
an Atheist, I should now have been  
convinced of the being and govern­  
ment of a Dictv! It is he who abuses  
the proud, and favors the humble.  
May we never forget his goodness J,,

fest our gratitude, J  
But let im have these serious re­

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN NOT AN ATHEIST.  
To THE EDITOR oF THE FRIbUNE.  
SiR: Colonel Ingersoll, in his lecture Tues.­  
day evening, at Chickering Hall, on Thomas Paine,  
made the assertion that Benjamin Franklin was an Athe-­  
ist. I think he is mistaken, for in a letter written in  
17s4 to his friend, Mr. William Strahan, in England.  
Mr. Franklin says, referring to our Revolutionary victory:  
I am too well acquainted with all the springs and  
levers of our machine not to see that our hunian means  
unequal to our understanding, and that, if it had  
not been for the justice of our cause, and the consequent

raillery, when writing to his English correspondent, William  
Strahan, once more his friend, after the conclusion of the war:  
“Your contempt of our understandings, in comparison with  
your own, appeared to be not much better founded than that  
of our courage, if we may judge by this circumstance, that, in  
whatever court of Europe, a Yankee negotiator appeared, the  
wise British minister was routed, put in a passion, picked a  
quarrel with your friends, and was sent home with a flea in  
  
his ear.”* And if good Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of St. Asaph,  
  
had primary reference to the ability of Franklin himself in  
dealing with the French and English ministers, the remark  
held good also of his worthy associates: “The event has shown  
that, in their own arts, you were not inferior to the ablest of  
them.”’+  
  
Yet, while others were associated with him in the honor-  
able work, and right nobly discharged their part, it was after  
all, Dr. Franklin that was chiefly looked to to represent the  
United States in Europe entire, as it was he alone that could  
sustain the credit of the country whe

I remember your observing once to me as we  
sat together in the House of Commons, that no  
two journeymen printers within your knowledge  
had met with such success in the world as our-  
selves. You were then at the head of your pro-  
fession, and soon afterwards became a member of  
Parliament. I was an agent for a few provinces,  
and now act for them all. But we have risen by  
different modes. I, asa republican printer, always  
liked a form well planed down; being averse to  
those overbearing letters that hold their heads so  
high as to hinder their neighbors from appearing.  
You, as a monarchist, chose to work upon crown  
paper, and found it profitable; while I worked upon  
pro patria (often indeed called foolscap) with no  
less advantage. Both our heaps hold out very well,  
and we seem likely to make a pretty good day’s  
work of it. With regard to public affairs (to con-  
tinue in the same style), it seems to me that the  
compositors in your chapel do not cast off their  
copy well, nor perfectly understand imposing; their  
forms, too, are continually pestered by the outs  
and doubles, that are not easy to be corrected.  
And I think they were wrong in laying aside some  
faces, and particularly certain head-pieces, that  
would have been both useful and ornamental.  
But, courage! The business may still flourish with  
good management; and the master become as rich  
as any of the company.
