joining one in which sat a lady, for whom he  
conceived a sudden and violent passion, and  
was desirous of entering into a courtship on  
the spot; but the place not suiting a formal  
declaration, the exigency of the case sugges­  
ted the following plan : He politely handed  
his fair neighbor a Bible open, with a pin  
stuck in the following text: Second Epistle  
of John, verse fifth : “And now I beseech&#x27;  
thee, lady, not as though I wrote s new  
command unto thee, but that which we had  
from the beginning, that we love one an­  
other.” She returned it pointing to the sec­  
ond chapter of Ruth, verse tenth—“Then  
she fell on her fitce, aud bowed herself to the  
ground, and said unto him, why have I  
found grace in thine eyes, that thoushouldst  
take knowledge of me, seeing that I am a  
stranger?” He returned the hook, pointing  
to the thirteenth verse of the Third Epistle of  
John. “Having many things to write unto  
you, I would not write with paper and ink,  
but I trust to come unto you, aud speak face

plosions have been greatly re­  
duced. Still there is some dangerous  
oil sold and much carelessness prac­  
ticed, and as a consequence there are  
explosions, more or less common.  
  
Another prominent cause of danger  
in the use of kerosene is found in the  
practice of filling lamps after dark, or  
near a stove or fire place at anytime.  
If a lamp is replenished in the evening  
while it is still heated, a light being  
used to aid in conducting the opera­  
tion, the vapor issuing from the open  
lamp-can or filler may ignite and re­  
sult in serious consequences. Oil is  
also liable to be spilled and inflamed  
before its presence on the floor, table,  
or clothing is noticed. There should be a  
prohibition in every house against using  
kerosene to start or replenish fires, and  
against filling or trimming lamps at  
other times than when the work can  
be done by dayligbt. If this rule was  
more rigidly observed by all tho mem­  
bers of every household, &quot;accidents&quot;  
from the use of kerosene oil would soon  
ceasS to occur.

Still there is some dangerous  
oil sold and much carelessness prac­  
ticed, and as a consequence there are  
explosions, more or less common.  
Another prominent cause of danger  
in the use of kerosene is found in the  
practice offillinglamps after dark, or  
near a stove orlire-place at any time.  
If a lamp is replenished in the evening  
while it is still heated, alight being  
used to aid in conducting the operation,  
the vapor issuing from the, open lamp­  
can orfillermay ignite and result in  
serious consequences. Oil is also lia­  
ble to be spilled and inflamed before  
its presence on the floor, table ox  
clothing is noticed. There should be a  
prohibition in every house against,  
using kerosene to start or replenish  
fires, and against filling or trimming  
lamps at other times than when the  
work can bejaoneby daylight? If this  
rule was more rigidly observed byatt
