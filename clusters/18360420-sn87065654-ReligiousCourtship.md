She returned it, pointing to the following,—second chapter of Ruth, tenth verse:—&quot;Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, why have i found favor in thine eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?&quot;  
  
He returned the book, pointing to the 12 verse of the second epistle of John. &quot;Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink; but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face.&quot;
