r of Borrowing Money, a Man’s Credit depends on some or all of the following Particulars:  
1. His known Conduct with regard to former Loans, in the Punctuality with which he discharg’d them.  
2. His Industry in his Business.  
3. His Frugality in his Expences.  
4. The Solidity of his Funds, his Estate being good, and free of prior Debts, whence his undoubted Ability of Paying.  
  
5. His well-founded Prospects of greater future Ability, by the Improvement of his Estate in Value, and by Aids from others.  
6. His known Prudence in Managing his general Affairs, and the Advantage they will probably receive from the present Loan he desires.  
7. His known Virtue, and honest Character manifested by his voluntary Discharge of Debts that he could not otherwise have been oblig’d to pay.  
The same Circumstances that give a private Man Credit, ought to have and will have their Weight with Lenders of Money to publick Bodies or to Nations.  
If then we consider and compare Britain and America in those several Lights, upon the Question to which it is safest to lend Money we shall find  
1. With Regard to former Loans; that America which borrowed Ten Millions Sterling during the last War for the Maintenance of her Army of 25,000 Men and other Charges, had faithfully discharg’d and paid that Debt and all her other Debts, in 1772: whereas Britain during those ten years of Peace and profitable Commerce had made little or no Reduction of her Debt, but on the contrary from time to time diminish’d the Hopes of her Creditors by a wanton Diversion and Misapplication of the Sinking Fund which had been destin’d for the Discharge of it.  
2. With regard to Industry in Business. Every Man in America is employ’d. The greatest Number in cultivating their own Lands; the rest in Handicrafts, Navigation and Commerce. An idle Man is a Rarity. Idleness and Inutility is a Character of Disgrace. In England the Quantity of that Character is immense. Fashion has spread it far and wide. Hence the Embarassment of private Fortunes and the daily Bankrupcies, arising from the universal fondness for Appearance and expensive Pleasures. And hence in some degree the Mismanagement of their publick Business: For Habits of Business and Ability in it are acquired only by Practice; and where universal Dissipation and the perpetual Pursuit of Amusement are the Mode, the Youth who are educated in it, can rarely afterward acquire that patient Attention and close Application to Affairs, which are so necessary to a Statesman charg’d with the Care of National Welfare. Hence their frequent Errors in Policy. Hence the Weariness at Publick Councils and the Backwardness in going to them; the constant Unwillingness to engage in any Measure that requires Thought and Consideration; and the Readiness for postponing every new Proposition, which postponing is therefore the only Part of Business that they come to be expert in, an Expertness produc’d necessarily by so much daily Practice. Whereas in America, Men bred to close Employment, in their private Affairs, attend with habitual Ease to those of the Publick when engag’d in them, and nothing fails through Negligence.  
3. With regard to Frugality in Expences. The Manner of Living in America, is in general more simple, and less Expensive than that in England. Plain Tables, plain Clothing, plain Furniture in Houses, few Carriages of Pleasure. In America an expensive Appearance hurts Credit, and is therefore avoided. In England it is often put on with a View of gaining Credit, and continued to Ruin. In publick Affairs the Difference is still greater. In England Salaries of Officers and Emoluments of Office are enormous. A King has a Million Sterling per Annum, and yet cannot maintain his Family free of Debt, Secretaries of State, Lords of Treasury, Admiralty, &amp;c. have vast Appointments, an Auditor of the Exchequer has, tis Said, 6 pence the Pound or a Fortieth Part of all publick Money expended by the Nation, so that when a War costs 40,000,000 there is a Million for him: an Inspector of the Mint in the last new Coinage received as his Fees £65,000 Sterling a Year, to which Rewards no Service these Gentlemen can render the Public is by any means equivalent. This is all paid by the People, who are oppress’d by the Taxes so occasion’d, and thereby render’d less able to contribute to the Payment of necessary national Debts. In America, Salaries where indispensible are extreamly low, but much of publick Business is done gratis. The Honour of serving the publick ably and faithfully is deemed sufficient. Public Spirit really exists there, and has great Effects. In England it is universally deem’d a Non-Entity, and whoever pretends to it, is laugh’d at as a Fool, or suspected as a Knave. The Committees of Congress which form the Board of War, the Board of Treasury, the Naval Board, the Committee for Accounts, the Board of foreign Transactions for procuring Arms Ammunition, Clothing, &amp;c. all attend the Business of their respective Functions without any Salary or Emolument whatever tho’ they spend in it much more of their Time than any Lord of Treasury or Admiralty in England can afford from his Amusements. A late British Minister computed that the whole Expence of the Americans in their civil Government of 3,000,000 of People amounted to but £70,000 Sterling per Annum, and drew from thence a Conclusion that they ought to be taxed till their Expence equalled in proportion to what it cost Britain to govern Eight Millions: He had no Idea of a contrary Conclusion, that if 3,000,000 may be well governed for £70,000, Eight Millions may be as well governed for 3 times that Sum, and therefore the Expence of his own Government should be diminished. In that corrupted Nation, no Man is ashamed of being concern’d in lucrative Government Jobbs, in which the public Money is egregiously misapplied, and squandered; the Treasury pillaged; and more numerous and heavier Taxes are called for to the great Oppression of the People; while the Prospect of a greater Number of these Jobbs to be occasion’d by a War is an Inducement with many to cry out for War on all Occasions, and to oppose every Proposition of Peace. Hence the constant Increase of the National Debt, and the absolute Improbability of its ever being discharged.  
4. With Regard to the Solidity of Funds. The whole 13 States of America are engag’d for the Payment of every Debt contracted by the Congress, and The Debt to be contracted by the present War is the only Debt they will have to pay, all or nearly all the former Debts of particular Colonies being already discharged. Whereas England will have to pay not only the enormous Debt this War must occasion, but all their vast preceding Debt on the Interest of it; and while America is enriching itself by Prizes made upon the British Commerce, more than it ever did by any Commerce of its own, under the Restraints of a British Monopoly, Britain is growing poorer by the Loss of that Monopoly, the Diminution of its Revenues, and of course less able to discharge the present indiscreet Encrease of its Expences.  
  
5. With Regard to Prospects of greater future Ability. Britain has none such. Her islands are circumscrib’d by the Ocean. Excepting a few Parks or Forests she has no new Land to cultivate, and cannot therefore extend her Improvements. Her Numbers of People too, instead of Increasing from increas’d Subsistence, are continually diminishing from growing Luxury and the greater Difficulty of maintaining Families, which of course discourages early Marriage. Thus she will have fewer People to assist in paying her Debt, and that diminish’d Number will be poorer. America, on the contrary has besides her Lands already improved, a vast Territory yet to improve: The Lands cultivated continually increase in Value with the Encrease of People, and the People who double themselves by natural Propagation in 25 Years, will double yet faster by the Accession of Strangers as long as Lands are to be had for new Families; so that every 20 years there will be a double Number of Inhabitants oblig’d to discharge publick Debts, and those Inhabitants being more opulent may pay their Share with greater Ease.  
6. With Regard to Prudence in general Affairs and the Advantages they expect from the Loan desired. The Americans are Cultivators of Land, those engag’d in Fishery and Commerce are a small Number compar’d with the Body of the People. They have ever conducted their several Governments with Wisdom, avoiding Wars and vain expensive Projects, delighting only in their peaceable Occupations, which must considering the Extent of their yet uncultivated Territory, find them Employment still for Ages: Whereas England ever unquiet, ambitious, avaritious, imprudent, and quarrelsome, is half her time engag’d in some War or other, always at an Expence infinitely greater than the Advantage proposed if it could be obtained. Thus she made a War against Spain in 1739 for a Claim of Debt of about £95,000 (scarce a Groat a Head for the Nation) spent £40,000,000 Sterling in the War, and 50,000 Men, and made Peace without obtaining the Satisfaction demanded. Indeed there is scarce a Nation in Europe against which she has not made War on some frivolous Pretext or other, and by this means has imprudently accumulated a Debt that has brought her on the Verge of Bankrupcy. But the most indiscrete of all her Wars is the present against America, with which she might for Ages have preserv’d her profitable Connection by only a just and equitable Conduct. She is now acting like a mad Shopkeeper who should attempt by beating those that pass his Door to make them come in and be his Customers. America cannot submit to such Treatment without being first ruined, and being ruined her Custom will be worth nothing. And England to bring this to pass is adding to her Debt, and ruining herself effectually. America on the other Hand aims only at establishing her Liberty, and that Freedom of Commerce, which will be advantageous to all Europe, while the Abolishing of the Monopoly she has hitherto labour’d under will be an Advantage sufficiently ample to repay the Debt she may contract to accomplish it.  
7. With regard to Character in the honest Payment of Debts. The Punctuality of America in Discharge of Public Debts is shown under the first head; the general Character of the People in that respect appears from their faithful Payment of private Debts to England since the Commencement of the War. These were not indeed wanting some half Politicians who propos’d stopping that Payment till Peace should be restor’d alledging that in the usual Course of Commerce and of the Credit given there was always a Debt existing equal to the Trade of 18 Months. That the Trade being for 5 Millions Sterling per Annum, the Debt must be Seven Million and an half. That this Sum paid to the British Merchants would operate to prevent the Distress intended to be brought on Britain by our Stoppage of Commerce with her: For the Merchants receiving this Money and no Orders with it for farther Supplies would either lay it out in the Funds, or in employing Manufacturers to accumulate Goods for a future hungry Market in America, upon an expected Accommodation, by which Means the Funds would be kept up and the Manufacturers prevented from Murmuring. But in Answer it was alledged that Injuries from Ministers should not be reveng’d on Merchants who were our Friends; that the Credit was in consequence of private Contracts made in Confidence of good Faith; that these ought to be held sacred and faithfully comply’d with; for that whatever publick Utility might be suppos’d to arise from a Breach of private Faith, it was unjust, and would in the End be found unwise, Honesty being in truth the best Policy. On this Principle the Proposition was universally rejected: And tho’ the English prosecuted the War against us with unexampled Barbarity, burning our defenceless Towns in the midst of Winter and arming Savages against us, the Debt was punctually paid; and the Merchants of London have testify’d to the Parliament and will testify to all the World that from their Experience in dealing with us they had before the War no Apprehensions of our Unfairness, and that since the War they have been convinc’d that their good Opinion of us was wellfounded. England on the Contrary, an old, corrupt, extravagant and profligate Nation, sees herself deep in Debt which she is in no Condition to pay, and yet is madly and dishonestly running deeper; despairing ever to satisfy her Creditors; and having no Prospect of discharging her Debts but by a Publick Bankrupcy.  
On the whole it appears, that from the general Industry, Frugality, Ability, Prudence and Virtue of America, she is a much safer Debtor than Britain. To say nothing of the Satisfaction generous Minds must have in reflecting, that by Loans to America they are opposing Tyranny and aiding the Cause of Liberty which is the Cause of all Mankind.

1) England it is often affumed to gain credit,  
and conti uc «| to ruin. Re fpecting public  
affairs, the difference is fill ereater, Ip  
England, the falaries of officers, and emo-  
luments of ofiice are enormous. ‘The king  
hasa million tterling per annum, and yet  
cannot maintain his family free from debt,  
Secretaries of ftate, lords of treafury, ad-  
miralty, &amp;c. have vaft appointments. An  
auditor of the exchequer has fixpence in the  
pound, ora fortieth part of all the public  
money expended in the nation ; fo that, when  
a war coft forty millions, one million is paid  
tohin. An infpector of the mint, in the  
Jaft new coinage, received as his fee 65,0001,  
fterling per annum; to all which rewards  
no fervice thefe gentlemen can render the  
public is by any means equivalent. All  
this 1s paid by the people, who are oppref-  
fed by taxes fo occafioned, and thereby ren-  
deved lefs able to contribute to the payment  
of neceffary national debts. In America  
falaries, where indifpenfable, ave extremely  
low, but much of the public bufinetfs 1s  
done gratis. The honour of ferving the  
public ably and faithfully is deemed futh-  
cient, Public ipirit real Ny exilts there, and

fimes that fum, and that therefore the ex-  
pence of hiS&#x27;own government fhould be di-  
minifhed. {Yn that corrupt nation no man  
is afhamed of being concerned in lucrative  
government jobbs, in which the public mo-  
ney is egregioufly mifapplied and {quander-  
ed, the Treafury pillaged, and more nume-  
yous and heavy taxes accumulated, to the  
great oppreflion of the people. But the  
profpect of a grearer number of fuch jobbs  
hy a war, is an inducement with many to  
ery out for war upon ail occafions, and to  
oppofe every propofition of peace. Hence  
the conitant increafe of the national debr,  
and the abiolute improbability of its ever  
being difcharged.  
  
4. Refpecting the amount and certainty  
ef income, and foitdity of fecurnty, the  
whole thirteen ftates of America are en-  
gaved for the payment of every debt con-  
tracted by the congrefs, and the debt to be  
contracted by theprefent war is the only debt  
they will have to pay; all, or nearly all the  
former debts of particular colonies being  
already difcharged. Whereas England will  
have to pay not only the enormous debt ihis  
war mult occafion, but all their vait pre-  
ceeding debt, or the mtereft of it; and while  
America is enriching itfelf by prizes made  
upon the Brith commerce, more than it  
ever did by any commerce of its own under  
the reftraints of a Brit.fh monopoly, Bri-  
tain is growing poorer by. the lofs of that  
monopoly, and the dunination of its reve-  
nues, andof courte lets abie to diicharge  
the.prefent indilcreet ancreafe of its expen-  
es.  
  
g Refoe&amp;ting profpects of greater fu-  
ture ability, Britain has none fuch. Her  
lands are circumicribed by the ocean ; and  
excepting a few parks or forefts fhe has  
nonew land to cultivate, and cannot. there-  
fore extend her improvements. Her numbers  
too, inftead of increafing from increaied fub-  
iltence, are continually diminithing from  
growing luxury, and the increafing difficul-  
tesof maintaining familiess which of courte  
dicourages early marnages. ‘Thus fhe will  
have fewer people to affi in paying her  
debts, and that diminifhed number will be  
poorer. America, on the contrary, has, be-  
ides her lands already cultivated, a vatt  
Kiritory yet to be cultivated, which being  
tiltivated, continually increale in value with  
he increafe of people; and the people,  
who double themtelves by a natural propa-  
tion every twenty-five years, will double  
yet fatter by the acceflion of firangers, as  
ngas lands are to be had for new fami-  
its; fo that every twenty years there will  
tadouble number of inhabitants obliged  
difcharge the public debts, and thofe in-  
Mbitants being more opulent, may pay their  
  
ares with greater eale,  
  
Obfervations en borrowing Money: by Dr. Franklin.  
  
6. Refpesting prudence in general affairs,  
and the advantages to be expected from the  
loan defired. The Americans are cultiva-  
ters of land, thofe engaged in fithery and  
comimerce are few, compared with the others.  
  
‘They haveever conducted their fevera! go-  
  
vernments with wifdom, avowling wars, and  
vain expenfive projets, delighting only in  
their peaceable eccupations, which mutt,  
eontidering the extent of their uncultivated  
territory, find them employment {till for  
ages, Whereas England, ever unquict, am  
bitious, avaritious, imprudent, and quar  
reliome, is half of the time engaged in @  
war, always at anexpence infinitely greater  
than the advantage to be obtained by it,  
if fuccetsful. Thus they made war againft  
Spam in 1729, for a claim of about os,000h  
(fcarce a grost for each individual in the  
nation) and {pent forty millions fterling in  
the war, and the lives of fifty thoufand mer,  
and hnally made peace without obtaining fa-  
tisfaction for the fum claimed. Indeed,  
there is fcarce a nation in Europe againtt  
which fhe has not made war on fome frivoe  
lous pretext or other, and thereby impru-  
dently accumulated a debt that has brought  
her ona veree of bankruptcy. But the mof  
indifercet of all her wars is the prefent againft  
America, with which the might, for ages,  
have preferved her profitable conneétion,  
only by a juft and equitable conduét. She,  
is now aciing like a mad fhopkeeper, who,  
by beating thote that pafs his doors, attempts  
to make them come in and be his cuftomers,  
America cannot fubmit to fuch treatment,  
without being frit ruined; and being rue  
ined, her cuttom will be worth nothings  
England, to effeét this, is increafing her  
debt, and irretrievably ruining hefelf. Ae  
menca, on the other hand, aims only to  
eitablifh her liberty, and that freedom of  
commerce which will be advantageous to all  
Europe ; and by abolifhing that monopoly  
Which fhe laboured under, the wil! profit in-  
hnitely more than enough to repay any  
debt which the may contraét to accomplifh  
it.  
  
7. Retpeéting chara&amp;ter in the honeft pay-  
  
ment of debts. ‘The pun&amp;uality with which &gt;  
  
America has difeharged her pubhe debts  
was fhewn under the frit head; amd the ge-  
neral good difpofition of the people to fych  
punctuality has been manitefted in their.  
faithful payment of private debts to Eneland

were not wanting foie politicians who pros  
poled ftopping that payment until peace  
fhould be reitored, alledging that im, the  
ufual courfe of commerce, and of the eredit  
given, there was always a debt exiting  
equal to the trade of eighteen months. That

‘* Seventhly, His known probity and honeft character, manifefted

of money to public bodies or nations. If then we confider and com-  
pare Britain and America, in thefe feveral particulars, upon the  
gjueftion, ** To which is it fafeft to lend money ?” We fhall find,  
  
“ Firft, Refpecting former loans, that America, which bor-  
rowed ten millions during the laft war, for the maintenance of  
her army of 25,000 men, and other charges, had faithfully dif-  
charged and paid that debt, and all other debts, in 1772. Whereas  
Britain, during thefe ten years of peace and profitable commerce,  
had made little or no reduction of her debr; but on the contrary,  
from time to time diminifhed the hopes of her creditors by a wan-  
ton diverfion and mifapplication of the finking fund deftined for  
difcharging it,  
  
“* Secondly, Refpecting ixdufry; every man [in America] is em-  
ployed; the greater part in cultivating their own lands; the re‘t  
in handicrafts, navigation, and commerce. An idle man is a ra-  
rity; idlenefg and inutility are difgraceful. Jn England the num-

wide; hence the embarraffment of private fortunes, and the daily  
bankrupicies, arifieg from an univerfal fondnefs for appearance  
and expeafive pleafures; and hence. in fome degree, the mifina-  
nagementsof public bufinefs ; for babits of bufinels, and ability ia  
it. are only acquired bypractice ; and where univerfal diflipation and  
the perpeiual puriuit of amudement are the mode, the youth educa.  
ted in itesn rarely afterwards acquire thar patient attention and clofe  
application to affairs, which are fo neceflary to a flatefman charged  
with tie care of national welfare. Hence their frequent errors:in  
policy 3 and hence the wearinefs at public councils, and backward.  
nels in going to them; the conftant un» illingnefs to engage in any  
aneafure that requires thought and corfideration ; and the seadinefs  
tor poltponing every new propofition ; which poftponing is there-  
fore the only part of bufinefs that they come to be expert in, an  
expertnefs produced neceflarily by io much daily practice. Where.  
as in erica, men bred to clofe employ ment in their private affairs,  
attend with cafe to thofe of the public, when engaged in them,  
and nothing tails through negligence.  
  
“ Thirdly, Retpecting frugality; the manner of living in 4m.  
rica is more fimple and lefs expenfive than that of England: plain  
tables, plain clothing, and plain furniture in houfes, prevail, with  
few carriages of pleafure; there, an expenfive appearance hurts  
credit, and is avoided: in England it is often aflumed to gain  
credit, and continued to ruin. Refpeéting public affairs, the  
Gifference is fill vreater. In England, the falaries of officers and  
emoluments of office are enormous. ‘The king has a million fter-  
Jing per avnum, and yet cannot maintain his family free from  
debt; Secretaries of State, Lords of Treafury, Admiralty, &amp;c,  
have vattapvoiatments: an auditor of the Exchequer has fixpence  
in the pound, or a fortieth part of all the public money expended by  
the nation 5 fo that when a war colts forty millions, one million is  
paid to him: an Infpe&amp;or of the Mint, in the laft new coinage  
received as his fee 65,coo!. fierling per annum: to all which re-  
wards no fervice thefe gentlemen can render the public is by any  
meansequivalent, All this is paid by the people ; who are ops  
pretied by taxes fo occalioned ; and thereby rendered lefs able to  
contribute to the payment of neceflary national debts. In America,  
falaries, where indifpenfible, are extyemely low; but much of the  
public bufinefs is done gratis. The honour of ferving the subli¢  
ably and taithfully is deemed fufficiene. Public fpirit really exifts  
there, and has great effe(f3, In England itis univerfally deemed  
a ron-entity, and whoever pretends to it is laughed at as a fool,  
or infpected as a knave. The committces of Congrefs, which form  
tac board of war, the board of treafury, the board of foreign af-  
fairs, the naval board, that for accounts, &amp;e. all attend the bufi-  
nefs of their refpective functions, without any falary or emolument  
whatever, though they fpend in it much more of their time than  
avy Lord of Treafury of Admiralty in England can fpare from_his  
zuuements. A Brtith minifter lately computed that the whole  
expence of the Americans, in their civil vovernment over three  
millions of people, anigunted tQ but 70,000! ‘ftefling, and drew

from thence a conclufion that they ought to be taxed, until their  
expence was equal in proportion to that which it cotts Britain to  
covero cight millions. He had no idea of a contrary conclufion ;  
that if three millions may be well governed for 70,000, eiyht mil-  
lions may be as well governed for three times that tum; and that  
therefore the expence of hisown government fhould be diminifhed.  
In that corrupted nation no man is afhamed of being concerned in  
lucrative government jobs, in which the public money is egregioufly  
mifapplied and fquandered, the treafury pillaged, and more nu-  
merous and heavy taxes accumulated ; to the great opprefiion of  
the people. But the profpect of a greater number of {uch jobs by  
a war is an inducement with many to cry out for war upon all oc-  
cafions, and to oppofe every propofition of peace. Hence the  
confiant increafe of the national debt, and the abiolute improba-  
bility of itsever being difcharged.  
  
‘Fourthly, Refpecting the amount and certaixty of income,  
and folidity of fecurity, the wh-:le Thirteen States of Awerica are  
engaged for the payment of every debt contracted by the Con-  
erefs ; and the debt to be contracted by the prefent war is the only  
debt they will have to pay; all, or nearly all the former cebts of  
particular colonies being already difcharged. Whereas England  
will have to pay not only the enormous debt this war muft occa-  
fion, but all their vaft preceding debt, or the interett of ir; and  
while America is enriching i:felf by prizes made upon the Britith  
commerce, more than it ever did by any commerce of its own,  
under the reftraints’of a Britifh monopoly, Britain is growing poorer  
by the lofs of that monopoly, and the diminution of its retources ;  
and of courfe lefs ab&#x27;e to ditcharge the prefent indifcreet increafe of  
its expences,  
  
“Fifthly, RefpeGing profpe&amp;s of future ability, Britain has  
none fuch. Her iflands are circumfcribed by the ocean; and ex-  
cepting a few parks or forefts, fhe has no new lands to cultivate,  
and cannot therefore extend her improvements, Her numbers too,  
infterd of increafing from increafed fubfiftence, are continually di-  
minifhing from growing luxury, and the increafing difficulties of  
maintaining families, which of courfe difcourages early marriages.  
Thus fhe will have fewer people te affift in paying her debts, and  
that diminifhed number will be poorer. America, on the contrary,  
has, befides her lands already cultivated, a vait territory yet to be  
cultivated ; which being cultivated, continually increafe in value  
with the increafe of people; and the people, who double them-  
ielves by a natural propagation every twenty-five years, will double  
yet fafter, by the acceflion of frangers, as long as lands are to be  
had for new families ; fo that every twenty years there will be a  
double number of inhabitants obliged to diicharge the public debts ;  
and thofe inhabitants being more opulent, may pay their tharcs  
with greater eafe,  
  
“* Sixthly, Refpecting prudence in general affairs, and the advan-  
tages to be expected from the loan defired ; the Americans are cul-  
tivaiors of land; thofe engaged in fithery and commerce are few,  
compared with the others. They have ever conducted their feveral  
governments

governments with wifdom, avoiding wars, and vain expenfive pto  
jets, delighting only in their peaceable occupations, which mutt,  
confidering the extent of their uncultivated territory, find them  
employment flill for ages. Whereas England, ever unq:iet, am-  
bitious, avaricious, imprudent and quarrelfome, is haif of the time  
engaged in a war; always aten expence infinitely greater than the  
advantage to be obtained by it, ‘f/ucer/iful. “Thus they made war  
againft Spain in 1739, for a claim of about 94,0001. ({carce a groat  
for each individual of the nation) and {peat forty millions flerling  
in the war, and the lives of fifty-thoufand men ; and finally made  
peace without obtaining fatisfaétion for the fiim claimed. Indeed,  
there is {earce a nation in Europe, againft which fhe has not  
made war on fome frivolous pretext or other; and thereby impra-  
dently accumulated a debt that has brought her on the verge  
of bankruptcy. But the moft indifcreet of all her wars, is the pre-  
fent againit America, with which the might for ages have preferv-  
ed her profitable connection, only by a juft and equitable condué,  
She is now ating like a mad fhopkeeper, who by beating thof  
that pafs his doors, attempts to make them come ia, and be his  
cuftomers. America cannot fubmit to fuch treatment, without  
being firit ruined; and being ruined, her cuftom will be worth  
nothing. America, on the other hand, aims only to cftablith her  
liberty, and that freedom of commerce which will be advantageous  
to all Europe; and by abolifhing that monopoly which the labour-  
ed under, the will profit infinitely more than enough, to repay any  
debt which fhe contracts to accomplifh it.  
  
** Seventhly, refpecting charadtr in the honcff payment of debts ; the  
punctuality with which America has difcharged her public debts was  
fhewn under the firit head.—And the general good difpofition of the  
people to fuch punctuality, has been manifetted in their faithful  
payment of private debts to England, fince the commencement of  
this war.—There were not wanting fome politicians [in America],  
who propofed fropping that payment, until peace fhould be reftored ;  
alledging thatin the ufaal cource of commerce, and of the credit  
given, there was always a debt exiiting equal to the trade of eigh-  
teen months: that the trade amounting to five millions fterling per  
annum, the debt maft be feven millions and a half; that the fum  
paid tothe Britith minifters, would operate to prevent that diftrefs,  
intended to be brought upon Britain, by our ftoppage of com-  
merce with her; for the merchants receiving this money, and no  
orders with farther fupplies, would cither lay it ovt in the public  
funds, or in employing manufacturers to accumulate goods fora  
future hungry market in America, upon an expected accommo-  
dation ; by which means the funds weuld be kept up, and the ma-  
nvfacturers prevented from murmuring. But againf this ii was al-  
  
cd, that injuries from minilfters fhould not be revenged on met-  
  
; that the credit was in confequence of private contracts,  
confidence of good faith; that thefe ought to be held fa-  
  
i saithfully complied with; for whatever public utility

might be fuppofed to arife from a breach of private faith, it was  
unjuft, and would in ghe end be found unwife; honefty being in  
truth, the beft policy. On this principle the propofition was uni-  
terfally rejected ; and though the Englith profecuted the war, with  
unexampled barbarity, burning our dcfencelefs towns in the midit  
of winter, and arming favages againft us, the debt was punstualty  
paid ; and the merchants of London have teftified to all the world,  
that from their experience in dealing with us, they had before the  
war, no apprehention of our unfairnefs ; and that fince the war  
they have been convinced, that their good opinion of us was well  
founded. England, on the contrary, an old, corrupt, extravagant,  
and profligate nation, fees herfelf deep in debt, which the is in  
no condition to pay; and yet is madly and difhoncitly, rurning  
deeper, without any poffibility of difcharging her debt, but by a  
public bankruptcy.  
  
‘« It appears, therefore, from a general induftry, frugality, abi-  
lity, prudence, and virtue of America, that the is a much fafer  
debtor than Britain :—to fay nothing of the fatisfaction generous  
minds muft have in reflefling, that by loans to America, they  
are oppofing tyranny, and aiding the caufe of liberty, which is  
the caufe of all mankind.”
