 with half the central number, make 180, equal to the number of degrees in a semicircle.  
Also half the numbers in any one of the concentric circles, taken either above or below the horizontal double line, with half the central number, make 180.  
And if any four adjoining numbers, standing nearly in a square, be taken from any part, and added with half the central number, they make 180.  
There are, moreover, included four other sets of circular spaces, excentric with respect to the first, each of these sets containing five spaces. The centers of the circles that bound them, are at A, B, C, and D. Each set, for the more easy distinguishing them from the first, are drawn with a different colour’d ink, red, blue, green, and yellow.  
  
*In the plate they are distinguished by dashed or dotted lines, as different as the engraver could well make them.  
  
These sets of excentric circular spaces intersect those of the concentric, and each other; and yet the numbers contained in each of the twenty excentric spaces, taken all around, make, with the central number, the same sum as those in each of the 8 concentric, viz. 360. The halves, also of thos

rom the centers A and C, taken above or below the double horizontal line, and of those drawn from centers B and D, taken to the right or left of the vertical line, do, with half the central number, make just 180.  
  
It may be observed, that there is not one of the numbers but what belongs at least to two of the different circular spaces; some to three, some to four, some to five; and yet they are all so placed as never to break the required number 360, in any of the 28 circular spaces within the primitive circle.

There are, moreover, included four

by circles which are excentric with ref-

thefe {ets containing five fpaces. The

bounded by lines of fhort unconneéted  
ftrokes; andthe fetround D is bounded  
by lines of unconnc ed longer ftrokes,  
to diftinguifh them from one another.  
In drawing this figure by hand, the fet  
of concentric circles flould be drawn  
with black ink; and the four different  
fets cf excentric circles with four kinds  
of ink of different colours; as blue,  
red, yellow, and green, for diftinguifh-  
ing them readily from one another.

tained in each of the excentric fpaces,  
taken all around through any of the  
20, which dare excentric, make the fame  
fum as thofe in the concentric ; namely  
360, when the central number 12 1s  
added. Their halves alfo, taken above  
or below the double horizontal line,  
with half the central number, make 180.
