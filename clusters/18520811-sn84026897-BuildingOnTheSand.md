&#x27;Tis well to woo, &#x27;tis well to wed,  
For so the world has done  
Since myrtles grew, and roses blew,  
And morning brought the sun.  
  
But have a care, ye young and fair—  
Be sure ye pledge with truth,  
Be certain that your love will wear  
Beyond the days of youth.  
  
For, if ye give not heart for heart,  
As well as hand for hand,  
You&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ve played the unwise part  
And &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
  
&#x27;Tis well to save, &#x27;tis well to have  
A goodly store of gold,  
And hold enough of the shining stuff,  
For charity is cold.  
  
But place not all your hopes and trust  
In what the deep mine brings;  
We cannot live on yellow dust  
Unmixed with purer things.  
  
And he who piles up wealth alone,  
Will often have to stand  
Beside his coffer chest, and own  
&#x27;Tis &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
  
&#x27;Tis good to speak in kindly guise,  
And soothe where&#x27;er we can;  
Fair speech should bind the human mind  
And love link man to man.  
  
But stay not at the gentle words,  
Let deeds with language dwell,  
The one who pities starving birds,  
Should scatter crumbs as well.  
  
The mercy that is warm and true  
Must lend a helping hand,  
For those who talk, yet fail to do,  
But &quot;build upon the sand.&quot;

f night until the dawn  
They sleep forgetting fear.  
The hare sleeps where it lies,  
With weary, half-closed eyes;  
The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck:  
Only the fox is out, some heedless duck  
Or chicken to surprise.  
Remote, each single star  
Comes out till they are there  
All shining so brightly ; now the dew falls  
damp ;  
While close at hand the glowworm lights her  
lamp  
Or twinkles from afar.  
But evening now is done  
As much as if the sun,  
Day-giving, had arisen in the east;  
For night has come, and the great calm has  
ceased;  
The quiet sands have run.
