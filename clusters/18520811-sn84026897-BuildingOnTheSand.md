&#x27;Tis well to woo, &#x27;tis well to wed,  
For so the world has done  
Since myrtles grew, and roses blew,  
And morning brought the sun.  
  
But have a care, ye young and fair—  
Be sure ye pledge with truth,  
Be certain that your love will wear  
Beyond the days of youth.  
  
For, if ye give not heart for heart,  
As well as hand for hand,  
You&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ve played the unwise part  
And &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
  
&#x27;Tis well to save, &#x27;tis well to have  
A goodly store of gold,  
And hold enough of the shining stuff,  
For charity is cold.  
  
But place not all your hopes and trust  
In what the deep mine brings;  
We cannot live on yellow dust  
Unmixed with purer things.  
  
And he who piles up wealth alone,  
Will often have to stand  
Beside his coffer chest, and own  
&#x27;Tis &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
  
&#x27;Tis good to speak in kindly guise,  
And soothe where&#x27;er we can;  
Fair speech should bind the human mind  
And love link man to man.  
  
But stay not at the gentle words,  
Let deeds with language dwell,  
The one who pities starving birds,  
Should scatter crumbs as well.  
  
The mercy that is warm and true  
Must lend a helping hand,  
For those who talk, yet fail to do,  
But &quot;build upon the sand.&quot;

For so the world has done  
Since mnyrtles grew and roses blew,

But have a care, ye young and fair  
Be sure ye pleige with truth;  
Be certain that your love will wear  
Beyond the days of youth.  
For if ye give not heart for heart,  
As well as hand for hand,  
You&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ve played the &quot;unwise p  
And &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
&#x27;I&#x27;s well to save, &#x27;tis good to have

And hold enough of hining stuff  
For charity is cold:  
B.r place not al your hopes and trust  
In what the deep mine brings;

And he who piles up wealth alone,

Ieir speech should bind the human mind,  
And love link man to man.  
Bat stay not in the gentie worls,  
Let leels with language dwell:

Every schoolboy knows that a kite  
would not fly unless it had a string tying  
it down. It is just so in life. The man  
who is tied down by half a dozen blooming  
responsibilities and their mother will make  
a stronger and higher flight than the old

POETRY.  
Building Upon the Sand.  
BY ELIZA COOK.  
‘Tis well to woo, ‘tis well to wed,  
For so the world has done  
Since myrtles grew, and roses blew,  
And morning brought the sun.  
But have a care, ye young and fair,  
Be sure ye pledge with truth;  
Be certain that your love will wear  
Beyond the days of youth.  
For if ye give not heart for heart,  
As well as hand for hand,  
You’ll find you’ve played the “unwise” part,  
And “built upon the sand.”  
’Tis well to save, ’tis well to have  
A goodly store of gold,  
And hold enough of shining stuff,  
For charity is cold.  
But place not all your hopes and trust  
In what the deep mine brings;  
We cannot live on yellow dust  
Unmixed with purer things.  
And he who piles up wealth alone,  
Will otten have to stand  
Beside his coffer-chest, and own  
’Tis “built upon the sand.”  
’Tis good to speak in kindly guise,  
And soothe what’er we can ;  
For speech should blind the human mind,  
And love link man to man.  
But stay not at the gentle words,  
Let deeds with language dwell;  
The one who pities starving birds,  
Should scatter crumbs as well  
The mercy that is warm and true,  
Must lend a helpiug hand,  
For those who talk, yet fail to do,  
But “build upon the sand.”

&quot;Tis wise to woo, &#x27;tis well to wed,  
For so the world has done  
Since myrtles grew and rosee blew,

But have a care, ye young and fair!  
Be sure ye pledge with truth  
Be certain that your love will wear  
Beyend the days of youth.  
Forif ye give not heart to heart,  
As well as hand to hand,  
You&#x27;d find you&#x27;ve played the unwise part,  
And &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
Tis well to save, &#x27;tis well to have  
A goodly store of gold,  
And hold enough of sterling stuff,  
For charity is cold.  
But place not all your hopes and trust  
In what the deep mine brings  
We can not live on yellow dust,  
Unmized with purer things.  
And he who piles up wealth alone  
Wull often have to stand  
Beside his coffer chest, and own

bet deeds with language dwell,

Should scatter crumbs as well.
