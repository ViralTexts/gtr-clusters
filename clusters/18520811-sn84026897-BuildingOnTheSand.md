&#x27;Tis well to woo, &#x27;tis well to wed,  
For so the world has done  
Since myrtles grew, and roses blew,  
And morning brought the sun.  
  
But have a care, ye young and fair—  
Be sure ye pledge with truth,  
Be certain that your love will wear  
Beyond the days of youth.  
  
For, if ye give not heart for heart,  
As well as hand for hand,  
You&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ve played the unwise part  
And &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
  
&#x27;Tis well to save, &#x27;tis well to have  
A goodly store of gold,  
And hold enough of the shining stuff,  
For charity is cold.  
  
But place not all your hopes and trust  
In what the deep mine brings;  
We cannot live on yellow dust  
Unmixed with purer things.  
  
And he who piles up wealth alone,  
Will often have to stand  
Beside his coffer chest, and own  
&#x27;Tis &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
  
&#x27;Tis good to speak in kindly guise,  
And soothe where&#x27;er we can;  
Fair speech should bind the human mind  
And love link man to man.  
  
But stay not at the gentle words,  
Let deeds with language dwell,  
The one who pities starving birds,  
Should scatter crumbs as well.  
  
The mercy that is warm and true  
Must lend a helping hand,  
For those who talk, yet fail to do,  
But &quot;build upon the sand.&quot;

&#x27;Tis well to woo, &#x27;tis well to wed,  
For so the world hath done  
Since myrtles grew, and roses blew,  
And morning brought the sun.  
But have a care, ye young and fair  
Be sure ye pledge with truth  
Be certain that your love will wear  
Beyond the days ot youth ;  
For, if ye gire not heart for heart,  
As well as hand for hand, ,  
Youll find you&#x27;ve played the &#x27; unwise parti  
And &quot; built upon the sand.&quot;  
&#x27;Tis well to save, &#x27;tis well to have  
A goodly store of gold,  
And hold enough of the shining stuff  
For charity is cold.  
But place not ell your hope and trust  
In what tbe deep mine bring ;  
We cannot live on yellow dust  
Unmixed with purer things.  
And he who piles up wealth alone,  
Will often have to stand  
Beside his coffer-chest, and own  
&#x27;Tis &quot; built upon the sand.&quot;  
Tis good to speak in kindly guise,  
And soothe where&#x27;er we can ; .  
Fair speech should blind the human mind ,  
And love link man to man.  
But stay not at tbe gentle words,  
Let deeds witb language dwell,  
Tbe one wbo pities starving birds  
Should scatter crumbs as well.  
The mercy that is warm and true  
Must lend a helping band,  
For those who talk, yet fail to doy  
But &quot; build upon the sand.&quot;

f night until the dawn  
They sleep forgetting fear.  
The hare sleeps where it lies,  
With weary, half-closed eyes;  
The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck:  
Only the fox is out, some heedless duck  
Or chicken to surprise.  
Remote, each single star  
Comes out till they are there  
All shining so brightly ; now the dew falls  
damp ;  
While close at hand the glowworm lights her  
lamp  
Or twinkles from afar.  
But evening now is done  
As much as if the sun,  
Day-giving, had arisen in the east;  
For night has come, and the great calm has  
ceased;  
The quiet sands have run.

&#x27;Tis well to woo ? &#x27;lis well to wed ?  
For so the world hath done,  
Since myrtles gray and roses blue,  
And morning brought the sun.  
But haYe a cure, ye young and fair,  
Be sure you wed with truth ;  
Be certain that young love will ware  
Beyond the days of youth ;  
For if you give not heart for heart,  
As well as hand for hand,  
You&#x27;ll findyou&#x27;r played the unwise pari,  
And &quot;build upon the sand.&quot;  
&#x27;Tis well to save ? &#x27;tis well to have  
A goodly share of gold,  
And hold enough of shining stuO,  
Forch.irity is cold.  
But place not all your hopes and trust  
Iu what the deep mine brings ;  
We cannot live on yellow dust,  
Unmixed with purer things ;  
And he who piles up wealth alone,  
Will often have to stand  
Beside his chest and sadly own,  
&#x27;Till &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;  
&#x27;Tis good to speak in kindly guise,  
And soothe where &#x27;re you can ;  
Fair speech should blind the human mind,  
And love link man to man.  
But stay not at thy gentle words ?  
Let deeds with language dwell ;  
The one who pities starving birds,  
Should scatter crumbs as well.  
The ttemory that is warm and true  
Must lend a helping hand ;  
For those who talk, yet fail to do,  
Have &quot;built upon the sand.&quot;
