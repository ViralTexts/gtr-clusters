e these negotiations were in progress Franklin joined the debate. He and his friends had discussed the matter in the Junto, he wrote many years later in his autobiography, and he was “on the Side of an Addition.” He remembered the stagnant condition of the city when he “first walk’d about the Streets of Philadelphia, eating my Roll,” in 1723 just before the first of the currency acts began to take effect, and by contrast the prosperity that had followed. He attributed the great improvement to the more plentiful supply of a circulating medium. “Our Debates possess’d me so fully of the Subject, that I wrote and printed an anonymous Pamphlet on it, entituled, The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency.” This essay was dated April 3

T ENQUIRY, &amp;C.  
There is no Science, the Study of which is more useful and commendable than the Knowledge of the true Interest of one’s Country; and perhaps there is no Kind of Learning more abstruse and intricate, more difficult to acquire in any Degree of Perfection than This, and therefore none more generally neglected. Hence it is, that we every Day find Men in Conversation contending warmly on some Point in Politicks, which, altho’ it may nearly concern them both, neither of them understand any more than they do each other.  
Thus much by way of Apology for this present Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency. And if any Thing I shall say, may be a Means of fixing a Subject that is now the chief Concern of my Countrymen, in a clearer Light, I shall have the Satisfaction of thinking my Time and Pains well employed.  
To proceed, then,  
There is a certain proportionate Quantity of Money requisite to carry on the Trade of a Country freely and currently; More than which would be of no Advantage in Trade, and Less, if much less, exceedingly detrimental to it.  
This leads us to the following general Considerations.  
First, A great Want of Money in any Trading Country, occasions Interest to be at a very high Rate. And here it may be observed, that it is impossible by any Laws to restrain Men from giving and receiving exorbitant Interest, where Money is suitably scarce: For he that wants Money will find out Ways to give 10 per Cent. when he cannot have it for less, altho’ the Law forbids to take more than 6 per Cent. Now the Interest of Money being high is prejudicial to a Country several Ways: It makes Land bear a low Price, because few Men will lay out their Money in Land, when they can make a much greater Profit by lending it out upon Interest: And much less will Men be inclined to venture their Money at Sea, when they can, without Risque or Hazard, have a great and certain Profit by keeping it at home; thus Trade is discouraged. And if in two Neighbouring Countries the Traders of one, by Reason of a greater Plenty of Money, can borrow it to trade with at a lower Rate than the Traders of the other, they will infallibly have the Advantage, and get the greatest Part of that Trade into their own Hands; For he that trades with Money he hath borrowed at 8 or 10 per Cent. cannot hold Market with him that borrows his Money at 6 or 4. — On the contrary, A plentiful Currency will occasion Interest to be low: And this will be an Inducement to many to lay out their Money in Lands, rather than put it out to Use, by which means Land will begin to rise in Value and bear a better Price: And at the same Time it will tend to enliven Trade exceedingly, because People will find more Profit in employing their Money that Way than in Usury; and many that understand Business very well, but have not a Stock sufficient of their own, will be encouraged to borrow Money to trade with, when they can have it at moderate Interest.  
Secondly, Want of Money in a Country reduces the Price of that Part of its Produce which is used in Trade: Because Trade being discouraged by it as above, there is a much less Demand for that Produce. And this is another Reason why Land in such a Case will be low, especially where the Staple Commodity of the Country is the immediate Produce of the Land, because that Produce being low, fewer People find an Advantage in Husbandry, or the Improvement of Land. — On the contrary, A Plentiful Currency will occasion the Trading Produce to bear a good Price: Because Trade being encouraged and advanced by it, there will be a much greater Demand for that Produce; which will be a great Encouragement of Husbandry and Tillage, and consequently make Land more valuable, for that many People would apply themselves to Husbandry, who probably might otherwise have sought some more profitable Employment.  
As we have already experienced how much the Increase of our Currency by what Paper Money has been made, has encouraged our Trade; particularly to instance only in one Article, Ship-Building; it may not be amiss to observe under this Head, what a great Advantage it must be to us as a Trading Country, that has Workmen and all the Materials proper for that Business within itself, to have Ship-Building as much as possible advanced: For every Ship that is built here for the English Merchants, gains the Province her clear Value in Gold and Silver, which must otherwise have been sent Home for Returns in her Stead; and likewise, every Ship built in and belonging to the Province, not only saves the Province her first Cost, but all the Freight, Wages and Provisions she ever makes or requires as long as she lasts; provided Care is taken to make This her Pay Port, and that she always takes Provisions with her for the whole Voyage, which may easily be done. And how considerable an Article this is yearly in our Favour, every one, the least acquainted with mercantile Affairs, must needs be sensible; for if we could not Build our selves, we must either purchase so many Vessels as we want from other Countries, or else Hire them to carry our Produce to Market, which would be more expensive than Purchasing; and on many other Accounts exceedingly to our Loss. Now as Trade in general will decline where there is not a plentiful Currency, so Ship-Building must certainly of Consequence decline where Trade is declining.  
Thirdly, Want of Money in a Country discourages Labouring and Handicrafts Men (which are the chief Strength and Support of a People) from coming to settle in it, and induces many that were settled to leave the Country, and seek Entertainment and Employment in other Places, where they can be better paid. For what can be more disheartning to an industrious labouring Man, than this, that after he hath earned his Bread with the Sweat of his Brows, he must spend as much Time, and have near as much Fatigue in getting it, as he had to earn it. And nothing makes more bad Paymasters than a general Scarcity of Money. And here again is a Third Reason for Land’s bearing a low Price in such a Country, because Land always increases in Value in Proportion with the Increase of the People settling on it, there being so many more Buyers; and its Value will infallibly be diminished, if the Number of its Inhabitants diminish. — On the contrary, A Plentiful Currency will encourage great Numbers of Labouring and Handicrafts Men to come and Settle in the Country, by the same Reason that a Want of it will discourage and drive them out. Now the more Inhabitants, the greater Demand for Land (as is said above) upon which it must necessarily rise in Value, and bear a better Price. The same may be said of the Value of House-Rent, which will be advanced for the same Reasons; and by the Increase of Trade and Riches People will be enabled to pay greater Rents. Now the Value of House-Rent rising, and Interest becoming low, many that in a Scarcity of Money practised Usury, will probably be more inclined to Building; which will likewise sensibly enliven Business in any Place; it being an Advantage not only to Brickmakers, Bricklayers, Masons, Carpenters, Joiners, Glaziers, and several other Trades immediately employ’d by Building, but likewise to Farmers, Brewers, Bakers, Taylors, Shoemakers, Shop-keepers, and in short to every one that they lay their Money out with.  
Fourthly, Want of Money in such a Country as ours, occasions a greater Consumption of English and European Goods, in Proportion to  the Number of the People, than there would otherwise be. Because Merchants and Traders, by whom abundance of Artificers and labouring Men are employed, finding their other Affairs require what Money they can get into their hands, oblige those who work for them to take one half, or perhaps two thirds Goods in Pay. By this Means a greater Quantity of Goods are disposed of, and to a greater Value; because Working Men and their Families are thereby induced to be more profuse and extravagant in fine Apparel and the like, than they would be if they were obliged to pay ready Money for such Things after they had earn’d and received it, or if such Goods were not imposed upon them, of which they can make no other Use: For such People cannot send the Goods they are paid with to a Foreign Market, without losing considerably by having them sold for less than they stand ’em in here; neither can they easily dispose of them at Home, because their Neighbours are generally supplied in the same Manner; But how unreasonable would it be, if some of those very Men who have been a Means of thus forcing People into unnecessary Expence, should be the first and most earnest in accusing them of Pride and Prodigality. Now tho’ this extraordinary Consumption of Foreign Commodities may be a Profit to particular Men, yet the Country in general grows poorer by it apace. — On the contrary, As A plentiful Currency will occasion a less Consumption of European Goods, in Proportion to the Number of the People, so it will be a means of making the Balance of our Trade more equal than it now is, if it does not give it in our Favour; because our own Produce will be encouraged at the same Time. And it is to be observed, that tho’ less Foreign Commodities are consumed in Proportion to the Number of People, yet this will be no Disadvantage to the Merchant, because the Number of People increasing, will occasion an increasing Demand of more Foreign Goods in the Whole.  
Thus we have seen some of the many heavy Disadvantages a Country (especially such a Country as ours) must labour under, when it has not a sufficient Stock of running Cash to manage its Trade currently. And we have likewise seen some of the Advantages which accrue from having Money sufficient, or a Plentiful Currency.  
The foregoing Paragraphs being well considered, we shall naturally be led to draw the following Conclusions with Regard to what Persons will probably be for or against Emitting a large Additional Sum of Paper Bills in this Province.  
1. Since Men will always be powerfully influenced in their Opinions and Actions by what appears to be their particular Interest: Therefore all those, who wanting Courage to venture in Trade, now practise Lending Money on Security for exorbitant Interest, which in a Scarcity of Money will be done notwithstanding the Law, I say all such will probably be against a large Addition to our present Stock of Paper-Money; because a plentiful Currency will lower Interest, and make it common to lend on less Security.  
2. All those who are Possessors of large Sums of Money, and are disposed to purchase Land, which is attended with a great and sure Advantage in a growing Country as this is; I say, the Interest of all such Men will encline them to oppose a large Addition to our Money. Because their Wealth is now continually increasing by the large Interest they receive, which will enable them (if they can keep Land from rising) to purchase More some time hence than they can at present; and in the mean time all Trade being discouraged, not only those who borrow of them, but the Common People in general will be impoverished, and consequently obliged to sell More Land for less Money than they will do at present. And yet, after such Men are possessed of as much Land as they can purchase, it will then be their Interest to have Money made Plentiful, because that will immediately make Land rise in Value in their Hands. Now it ought not to be wonder’d at, if People from the Knowledge of a Man’s Interest do sometimes make a true Guess at his Designs; for, Interest, they say, will not Lie.  
3. Lawyers, and others concerned in Court Business, will probably many of them be against a plentiful Currency; because People in that Case will have less Occasion to run in Debt, and conesquently less Occasion to go to Law and Sue one another for their Debts. Tho’ I know some even among these Gentlemen, that regard the Publick Good before their own apparent private Interest.  
4. All those who are any way Dependants on such Persons as are above mentioned, whether as holding Offices, as Tenants, or as Debtors, must at least appear to be against a large Addition; because if they do not, they must sensibly feel their present Interest hurt. And besides these, there are, doubtless, many well-meaning Gentlemen and Others, who, without any immediate private Interest of their own in View, are against making such an Addition, thro’ an Opinion they may have of the Honesty and sound Judgment of some of their Friends that oppose it,(perhaps for the Ends aforesaid) without having given it any thorough Consideration themselves. And thus it is no Wonder if there is a powerful Party on that Side.  
On the other Hand, Those who are Lovers of Trade, and delight to see Manufactures encouraged, will be for having a large Addition to our Currency: For they very well know, that People will have little Heart to advance Money in Trade, when what they can get is scarce sufficient to purchase Necessaries, and supply their Families with Provision. Much less will they lay it out in advancing new Manufactures; nor is it possible new Manufactures should turn to any Account, where there is not Money to pay the Workmen, who are discouraged by being paid in Goods, because it is a great Disadvantage to them.  
Again, Those who are truly for the Proprietor’s Interest (and have no separate Views of their own that are predominant) will be heartily for a large Addition: Because, as I have shewn above, Plenty of Money will for several Reasons make Land rise in Value exceedingly: And I appeal to those immediately concerned for the Proprietor in the Sale of his Lands, whether Land has not risen very much since the first Emission of what Paper Currency we now have, and even by its Means. Now we all know the Proprietary has great Quantities to sell.  
And since a Plentiful Currency will be so great a Cause of advancing this Province in Trade and Riches, and increasing the Number of its People; which, tho’ it will not sensibly lessen the Inhabitants of Great Britain, will occasion a much greater Vent and Demand for their Commodities here; and allowing that the Crown is the more powerful for its Subjects increasing in Wealth and Number, I cannot think it the Interest of England to oppose us in making as great a Sum of Paper Money here, as we, who are the best Judges of our own Necessities, find convenient. And if I were not sensible that the Gentlemen of Trade in England, to whom we have already parted with our Silver and Gold, are misinformed of our Circumstances, and therefore endeavour to have our Currency stinted to what it now is, I should think the Government at Home had some Reasons for discouraging and impoverishing this Province, which we are not acquainted with.  
  
It remains now that we enquire, Whether a large Addition to our Paper Currency will not make it sink in Value very much; And here it will be requisite that we first form just Notions of the Nature and Value of Money in general.  
As Providence has so ordered it, that not only different Countries, but even different Parts of the same Country, have their peculiar most suitable Productions; and likewise that different Men have Genius’s adapted to Variety of different Arts and Manufactures, Therefore Commerce, or the Exchange of one Commodity or Manufacture for another, is highly convenient and beneficial to Mankind. As for Instance, A may be skilful in the Art of making Cloth, and B understand the raising of Corn; A wants Corn, and B Cloth; upon which they make an Exchange with each other for as much as each has Occasion, to the mutual Advantage and Satisfaction of both.  
But as it would be very tedious, if there were no other Way of general Dealing, but by an immediate Exchange of Commodities; because a Man that had Corn to dispose of, and wanted Cloth for it, might perhaps in his Search for a Chapman to deal with, meet with twenty People that had Cloth to dispose of, but wanted no Corn; and with twenty others that wanted his Corn, but had no Cloth to suit him with. To remedy such Inconveniences, and facilitate Exchange, Men have invented Money, properly called a Medium of Exchange, because through or by its Means Labour is exchanged for Labour, or one Commodity for another. And whatever particular Thing Men have agreed to make this Medium of, whether Gold, Silver, Copper, or Tobacco; it is, to those who possess it (if they want any Thing) that very Thing which they want, because it will immediately procure it for them. It is Cloth to him that wants Cloth, and Corn to those that want Corn; and so of all other Necessaries, it is whatsoever it will procure. Thus he who had Corn to dispose of, and wanted to purchase Cloth with it, might sell his Corn for its Value in this general Medium, to one who wanted Corn but had no Cloth; and with this Medium he might purchase Cloth of him that wanted no Corn, but perhaps some other Thing, as Iron it may be, which this Medium will immediately procure, and so he may be said to have exchanged his Cloth for Iron; and thus the general Exchange is soon performed, to the Satisfaction of all Parties, with abundance of Facility.  
  
For many Ages, those Parts of the World which are engaged in Commerce, have fixed upon Gold and Silver as the chief and most proper Materials for this Medium; they being in themselves valuable Metals for their Fineness, Beauty, and Scarcity. By these, particularly by Silver, it has been usual to value all Things else: But as Silver it self is of no certain permanent Value, being worth more or less according to its Scarcity or Plenty, therefore it seems requisite to fix upon Something else, more proper to be made a Measure of Values, and this I take to be Labour.  
By Labour may the Value of Silver be measured as well as other Things. As, Suppose one Man employed to raise Corn, while another is digging and refining Silver; at the Year’s End, or at any other Period of Time, the compleat Produce of Corn, and that of Silver, are the natural Price of each other; and if one be twenty Bushels, and the other twenty Ounces, then an Ounce of that Silver is worth the Labour of raising a Bushel of that Corn. Now if by the Discovery of some nearer, more easy or plentiful Mines, a Man may get Forty Ounces of Silver as easily as formerly he did Twenty, and the same Labour is still required to raise Twenty Bushels of Corn, then Two Ounces of Silver will be worth no more than the same Labour of raising One Bushel of Corn, and that Bushel of Corn will be as cheap at two Ounces, as it was before at one; cæteris paribus.  
Thus the Riches of a Country are to be valued by the Quantity of Labour its Inhabitants are able to purchase, and not by the Quantity of Silver and Gold they possess; which will purchase more or less Labour, and therefore is more or less valuable, as is said before, according to its Scarcity or Plenty. As those Metals have grown much more plentiful in Europe since the Discovery of America, so they have sunk in Value exceedingly; for, to instance in England, formerly one Penny of Silver was worth a Days Labour, but now it is hardly worth the sixth Part of a Days Labour; because not less than Six-pence will purchase the Labour of a Man for a Day in any Part of that Kingdom; which is wholly to be attributed to the much greater Plenty of Money now in England than formerly. And yet perhaps England is in Effect no richer now than at that Time; because as much Labour might be purchas’d, or Work got done of almost any kind, for £100 then, as will now require or is now worth £600.  
In the next Place let us consider the Nature of Banks emitting Bills of Credit, as they are at this Time used in Hamburgh, Amsterdam, London and Venice.  
Those Places being Seats of vast Trade, and the Payment of great Sums being for that Reason frequent, Bills of Credit are found very convenient in Business; because a great Sum is more easily counted in Them, lighter in Carriage, concealed in less Room, and therefore safer in Travelling or Laying up, and on many other Accounts they are very much valued. The Banks are the general Cashiers of all Gentlemen, Merchants and great Traders in and about those Cities; there they deposite their Money, and may take out Bills to the Value, for which they can be certain to have Money again at the Bank at any Time: This gives the Bills a Credit; so that in England they are never less valuable than Money, and in Venice and Amsterdam they are generally worth more. And the Bankers always reserving Money in hand to answer more than the common Run of Demands (and some People constantly putting in while others are taking out) are able besides to lend large Sums, on good Security, to the Government or others, for a reasonable Interest, by which they are paid for their Care and Trouble; and the Money which otherwise would have lain dead in their Hands, is made to circulate again thereby among the People: And thus the Running Cash of the Nation is as it were doubled; for all great Payments being made in Bills, Money in lower Trade becomes much more plentiful: And this is an exceeding great Advantage to a Trading Country, that is not over-stock’d with Gold and Silver.  
As those who take Bills out of the Banks in Europe, put in Money for Security; so here, and in some of the neighbouring Provinces, we engage our Land. Which of these Methods will most effectually secure the Bills from actually sinking in Value, comes next to be considered.  
Trade in general being nothing else but the Exchange of Labour for Labour, the Value of all Things is, as I have said before, most justly measured by Labour. Now suppose I put my Money into a Bank, and take out a Bill for the Value; if this Bill at the Time of my receiving it, would purchase me the Labour of one hundred Men for twenty Days; but some time after will only purchase the Labour of the same Number of Men for fifteen Days; it is plain the Bill has sunk in Value one fourth Part. Now Silver and Gold being of no permanent Value; and as this Bill is founded on Money, and therefore to be esteemed as such, it may be that the Occasion of this Fall is the increasing Plenty of Gold and Silver, by which Money is one fourth Part less valuable than before, and therefore one fourth more is given of it for the same Quantity of Labour; and if Land is not become more plentiful by some proportionate Decrease of the People, one fourth Part more of Money is given for the same Quantity of Land, whereby it appears that it would have been more profitable to me to have laid that Money out in Land which I put into the Bank, than to place it there and take a Bill for it. And it is certain that the Value of Money has been continually sinking in England for several Ages past, because it has been continually increasing in Quantity. But if Bills could be taken out of a Bank in Europe on a Land Security, it is probable the Value of such Bills would be more certain and steady, because the Number of Inhabitants continue to be near the same in those Countries from Age to Age.  
For as Bills issued upon Money Security are Money, so Bills issued upon Land, are in Effect Coined Land.  
Therefore (to apply the Above to our own Circumstances) If Land in this Province was falling, or any way likely to fall, it would behove the Legislature most carefully to contrive how to prevent the Bills issued upon Land from falling with it. But as our People increase exceedingly, and will be further increased, as I have before shewn, by the Help of a large Addition to our Currency; and as Land in consequence is continually rising, So, in case no Bills are emitted but what are upon Land Security, the Money-Acts in every Part punctually enforced and executed, the Payments of Principal and Interest being duly and strictly required, and the Principal bona fide sunk according to Law, it is absolutely impossible such Bills should ever sink below their first Value, or below the Value of the Land on which they are founded. In short, there is so little Danger of their sinking, that they would certainly rise as the Land rises, if they were not emitted in a proper Manner for preventing it; That is, by providing in the Act That Payment may be made, either in those Bills, or in any other Bills made current by any Act of the Legislature of this Province; and that the Interest, as it is received, may be again emitted in Discharge of Publick Debts; whereby circulating it returns again into the Hands of the Borrowers, and becomes Part of their future Payments; and thus as it is likely there will not be any Difficulty for want of Bills to pay the Office, they are hereby kept from rising above their first Value: For else, supposing there should be emitted upon mortgaged Land its full present Value in Bills; as in the Banks in Europe the full Value of the Money deposited is given out in Bills; and supposing the Office would take nothing but the same Sum in those Bills in Discharge of the Land; as in the Banks aforesaid, the same Sum in their Bills must be brought in, in order to receive out the Money: In such Case the Bills would most surely rise in Value as the Land rises; as certainly as the Bank Bills founded on Money would fall if that Money was falling. Thus if I were to mortgage to a Loan-Office, or Bank, a Parcel of Land now valued at £100 in Silver, and receive for it the like Sum in Bills, to be paid in again at the Expiration of a certain Term of Years; before which, my Land rising in Value, becomes worth £150 in Silver: ’Tis plain, that if I have not these Bills in Possession, and the Office will take nothing but these Bills, or else what it is now become worth in Silver, in Discharge of my Land; I say it appears plain, that those Bills will now be worth £150 in Silver to the Possessor; and if I can purchase them for less, in order to redeem my Land, I shall by so much be a Gainer.  
I need not say any Thing to convince the Judicious that our Bills have not yet sunk, tho’ there is and has been some Difference between them and Silver; because it is evident that that Difference is occasioned by the Scarcity of the latter, which is now become a Merchandize, rising and falling, like other Commodities, as there is a greater or less Demand for it, or as it is more or less Plenty.  
Yet farther, in order to make a true Estimate of the Value of Money, we must distinguish between Money as it is Bullion, which is Merchandize, and as by being coin’d it is made a Currency: For its Value as a Merchandize, and its Value as a Currency, are two distinct Things; and each may possibly rise and fall in some Degree independent of the other. Thus if the Quantity of Bullion increases in a Country, it will proportionably decrease in Value; but if at the same Time the Quantity of current Coin should decrease, (supposing Payments may not be made in Bullion) what Coin there is will rise in Value as a Currency, i.e. People will give more Labour in Manufactures for a certain Sum of ready Money.  
In the same Manner must we consider a Paper Currency founded on Land; as it is Land, and as it is a Currency:  
Money as Bullion, or as Land, is valuable by so much Labour as it costs to procure that Bullion or Land.  
Money, as a Currency, has an Additional Value by so much Time and Labour as it saves in the Exchange of Commodities.  
If, as a Currency, it saves one Fourth Part of the Time and Labour of a Country; it has, on that Account, one Fourth added to its original Value.  
When there is no Money in a Country, all Commerce must be by Exchange. Now if it takes one fourth Part of the Time and Labour of a Country, to exchange or get their Commodities exchanged; then, in computing their Value, that Labour of Exchanging must be added to the Labour of manufacturing those Commodities: But if that Time or Labour is saved by introducing Money sufficient, then the additional Value on Account of the Labour of Exchanging may be abated, and Things sold for only the Value of the Labour in making them; because the People may now in the same Time make one Fourth more in Quantity of Manufactures than they could before.  
From these Considerations it may be gathered, that in all the Degrees between having no Money in a Country, and Money sufficient for the Trade, it will rise and fall in Value as a Currency, in Proportion to the Decrease or Increase of its Quantity: And if there may be at some Time more than enough, the Overplus will have no Effect towards making the Currency, as a Currency, of less Value than when there was but enough; because such Overplus will not be used in Trade, but be some other way disposed of.  
If we enquire, How much per Cent. Interest ought to be required upon the Loan of these Bills; we must consider what is the Natural Standard of Usury: And this appears to be, where the Security is undoubted, at least the Rent of so much Land as the Money lent will buy: For it cannot be expected that any Man will lend his Money for less than it would fetch him in as Rent if he laid it out in Land, which is the most secure Property in the World. But if the Security is casual, then a kind of Ensurance must be enterwoven with the simple natural Interest, which may advance the Usury very conscionably to any height below the Principal it self. Now among us, if the Value of Land is twenty Years Purchase, Five per Cent. is the just Rate of Interest for Money lent on undoubted Security. Yet if Money grows scarce in a Country, it becomes more difficult for People to make punctual Payments of what they borrow, Money being hard to be raised; likewise Trade being discouraged, and Business impeded for want of a Currency, abundance of People must be in declining Circumstances, and by these Means Security is more precarious than where Money is plenty. On such Accounts it is no wonder if People ask a greater Interest for their Money than the natural Interest; and what is above is to be look’d upon as a kind of Præmium for the Ensurance of those Uncertainties, as they are greater or less. Thus we always see, that where Money is scarce, Interest is high, and low where it is plenty. Now it is certainly the Advantage of a Country to make Interest as low as possible, as I have already shewn; and this can be done no other way than by making Money plentiful. And since, in Emitting Paper Money among us, the Office has the best of Security, the Titles to the Land being all skilfully and strictly examined and ascertained; and as it is only permitting the People by Law to coin their own Land, which costs the Government nothing, the Interest being more than enough to pay the Charges of Printing, Officers Fees, &amp;c. I cannot see any good Reason why Four per Cent. to the Loan-Office should not be thought fully sufficient. As a low Interest may incline more to take Money out, it will become more plentiful in Trade; and this may bring down the common Usury, in which Security is more dubious, to the Pitch it is determined at by Law.  
If it should be objected, That Emitting It at so low an Interest, and on such easy Terms, will occasion more to be taken out than the Trade of the Country really requires: It may be answered, That, as has already been shewn, there can never be so much of it emitted as to make it fall below the Land it is founded on; because no Man in his Senses will mortgage his Estate for what is of no more Value to him than That he has mortgaged, especially if the Possession of what he receives is more precarious than of what he mortgages, as that of Paper Money is when compared to Land: And if it should ever become so plenty by indiscreet Persons continuing to take out a large Overplus, above what is necessary in Trade, so as to make People imagine it would become by that Means of less Value than their mortgaged Lands, they would immediately of Course begin to pay it in again to the Office to redeem their Land, and continue to do so till there was no more left in Trade than was absolutely necessary. And thus the Proportion would find it self, (tho’ there were a Million too much in the Office to be let out) without giving any one the Trouble of Calculation.  
It may perhaps be objected to what I have written concerning the Advantages of a large Addition to our Currency, That if the People of this Province increase, and Husbandry is more followed, we shall overstock the Markets with our Produce of Flower, &amp;c. To this it may be answered, that we can never have too many People (nor too much Money) For when one Branch of Trade or Business is overstocked with Hands, there are the more to spare to be employed in another. So if raising Wheat proves dull, more may (if there is Money to support and carry on new Manufactures) proceed to the raising and manufacturing of Hemp, Silk, Iron, and many other Things the Country is very capable of, for which we only want People to work, and Money to pay them with.  
Upon the Whole it may be observed, That it is the highest Interest of a Trading Country in general to make Money plentiful; and that it can be a Disadvantage to none that have honest Designs. It cannot hurt even the Usurers, tho’ it should sink what they receive as Interest; because they will be proportionably more secure in what they lend; or they will have an Opportunity of employing their Money to greater Advantage, to themselves as well as to the Country. Neither can it hurt those Merchants who have great Sums out-standing in Debts in the Country, and seem on that Account to have the most plausible Reason to fear it; to wit, because a large Addition being made to our Currency, will increase the Demand of our Exporting Produce, and by that Means raise the Price of it, so that they will not be able to purchase so much Bread or Flower with £100 when they shall receive it after such an Addition, as they now can, and may if there is no Addition: I say it cannot hurt even such, because they will get in their Debts just in exact Proportion so much the easier and sooner as the Money becomes plentier; and therefore, considering the Interest and Trouble saved, they will not be Losers; because it only sinks in Value as a Currency, proportionally as it becomes more plenty. It cannot hurt the Interest of Great Britain, as has been shewn; and it will greatly advance the Interest of the Proprietor. It will be an Advantage to every industrious Tradesman, &amp;c. because his Business will be carried on more freely, and Trade be universally enlivened by it. And as more Business in all Manufactures will be done, by so much as the Labour and Time spent in Exchange is saved, the Country in general will grow so much the richer.  
It is nothing to the Purpose to object the wretched Fall of the Bills in New-England and South-Carolina, unless it might be made evident that their Currency was emitted with the same Prudence, and on such good Security as ours is; and it certainly was not.  
As this Essay is wrote and published in Haste, and the Subject in it self intricate, I hope I shall be censured with Candour, if, for want of Time carefully to revise what I have written, in some Places I should appear to have express’d my self too obscurely, and in others am liable to Objections I did not foresee. I sincerely desire to be acquainted with the Truth, and on that Account shall think my self obliged to any one, who will take the Pains to shew me, or the Publick, where I am mistaken in my Conclusions, And as we all know there are among us several Gentlemen of acute Parts and profound Learning, who are very much against any Addition to our Money, it were to be wished that they would favour the Country with their Sentiments on this Head in Print; which, supported with Truth and good Reasoning, may probably be very convincing. And this is to be desired the rather, because many People knowing the Abilities of those Gentlemen to manage a good Cause, are apt to construe their Silence in This, as an Argument of a bad One. Had any Thing of that Kind ever yet appeared, perhaps I should not have given the Publick this Trouble: But as those ingenious Gentlemen have not yet (and I doubt never will) think it worth their Concern to enlighten the Minds of their erring Countrymen in this Particular, I think it would be highly commendable in every one of us, more fully to bend our Minds to the Study of What is the true Interest of PENNSYLVANIA; whereby we may be enabled, not only to reason pertinently with one another; but, if Occasion requires, to transmit Home such clear Representations, as must inevitably convince our Superiors of the Reasonableness and Integrity of our Designs.

BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.  
There Is no science, the study of which  
la more useful and commendable than  
the knowledge of the true Interest of one&#x27;s  
country; and perhaps there la no kind of  
learning more abstruse and intricate,  
more difficult to acquire In any degree of  
perfection than this, and therefore more  
generally neglected.&#x27; Hence it is that we  
every day find men in conversation con­  
tending warmly on some point in politics,  
which, although it may concern them  
both, neither of them understands any  
more than they do each other.  
Thus much by way of apology for this  
present Inquiry into the Nature and  
Necessity of Paper Currency. And if  
anything I shall say may be a means of  
fixing a subject, that is now the chief  
concern of my countrymen, In a clearer  
light, I shall have the satisfaction of  
thinking my time and pains well em  
ployed.  
To proceed, then.  
There is a certain proportionate quan  
tity of money requisite to carry on the  
trades of a country freely and currently;  
more than which would be of no advan  
tage in trade, and less, if much less, ex  
ceedingly detrimental to it  
This leads us to the following general  
considerations:  
First A great want of money, in any  
trading country, occasions interest to be  
of a very high rate. And here it may  
be observed that it la impossible by any  
law to restrain men from giving or re­  
ceiving exorbitant interest where money  
Is suitably scarce. For he that wants  
money will find out ways to give 10 per  
cent, when he cannot have It for less,  
although the law forbids to take more  
than C per cent. Now the Interest of  
money being high is prejudicial to a  
country in several ways. It makes land  
bear a low price, because few men will  
lay out their money in land, when they  
can make a much greater profit by lend­  
ing out upon Interest And much less  
will men be inclined to ventnre money  
at sea, when they can, without risk or  
hazard, have a great and certain profit by  
keeping it home; thus trade is discour­  
aged. And if in two neighboring coun­  
tries the traders of one, by reason of a  
greater plenty of money, can borrow it to  
trade with at a lower rate than the trad­  
ers of the other, they will Infallibly have  
the advantage, and get the greatest part  
of the trade into their own hands; for he  
that trades with money he hath borrowed  
at 8 or 10 per cent cannot hold a market  
with him that borrows his money at 6  
or 4. On .the contrary, a plentiful cur­  
rency vnll occasion interest to be tow;  
  
of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance and  
  
TOPEKA, KANSAS, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 1891.  
  
and this will be an inducement to many  
to lay out their money In lands rather  
than put It out to use, by which means  
land will begin to rise in value and bear  
a better price. And at the same time it  
will tend to enliven trade exceedingly,  
because people will find more profit in  
employing their money that way than in  
usury; and many that understand busi­  
ness very well, but have not a stock suffi­  
cient of their own, will be encouraged to  
borrow money to trade with, when they  
can have It at a moderate interest  
Secondly Want of money in a conn­  
try reduces the price of that part of its  
produce which is used in trade; because,  
trade being discouraged by it as above,  
there is a much less demand for that  
produce. And this Is another reason  
why Ian4j&amp;wBuch. ft case will be low, es­  
pecially where the staple&quot; commodity of a  
country Is the immediate produce of the  
land; because, that produce being low,  
fewer people find an advantage In hus  
bandry, or the Improvement of land. On  
the contrary, a plentiful currency will  
occasion the trading produce to bear a  
good price; because, trade being encour  
aged and advanced by It, there will be a  
much greater demand for that produce;  
which will be a great encouragement of  
husbandry and tillage, and consequently  
make land more valuable, for that the  
people would apply themselves to hus  
bandry, who probably might otherwise  
have sought some more profitable em  
ployment  
As we have already experienced how  
much the increase of our currency, by  
what paper has been made, has encour­  
aged our trade, particularly to Instance  
only in one article, ship building, it may  
not be amiss to observe under this head,  
what a great advantage It must be to us  
as a trading country, that has workmen  
and all the materials proper for that  
business within Itself, to have ship build  
ing as much as possible advanced; for  
every ship that Is built here for the  
English merchants, gains the province  
her clear value In gold or silver, which  
must otherwise have been sent home for  
returns In her stead; and likewise every  
ship built In, and belonging to the  
province, not only saves to the  
province her first cost, but all the freight,  
wages and provisions she ever makes or  
requires as long as she lasts; provided  
care is taken to make this her pay port,  
and that she always takes provisions  
with her for the whole voyage, which  
may easily be done. And how considera  
ble an article this Is yearly in our favor,  
every one, the least acquainted with mer­  
cantile affairs, must needs be sensible;  
for, if we could not build ourselves, we

must either purchase so many vessels as  
we want from other countries, ox else  
hire them to carry our produce to mar  
ket, which would be more expensive  
than purchasing, and on many other ac  
counts exceedingly to our loes. Now as  
trade in general will decline where there  
is not a plentiful currency, so ihipbulld  
ing must certainly of consequence de  
cline where trade If dacllning.  
Thirdly Want of money in a , country  
discourages laboring and handicrafts­  
men (who are the chief strength and tup­  
port of a people) from coming to settle in  
it, and induces many that were settled to  
leave the country, and seek entertain  
ment and employment in othet places,  
where they can be better paid. For what  
can be more disheartening to an Indus  
trious laboring man than this, that, after  
he hath earned his bread by the sweat of  
his brow, he must spend as much time  
and have near as much fatigue in getting  
it as he had to earn it? And nothing  
makes more bad paymasters than a gen  
eral scarcity of money. And tyere again  
Is a third reason for lands bearing a low  
price in such a country, because land al  
ways increases In value in proportion  
with the increase of the people settling  
on it, there being so many more buyers;  
and the Value will Infallibly be dimln  
ished if the number of its Inhabitants  
diminish. On the contrary, a plentiful  
currency will encourage great numbers  
of laboring and handicraftsmen to come  
and settle in the country, by the same  
reason that a want of it will discourage  
and drive them out Now the more In­  
habitants, the greater demand for land  
(as Is said above) upon which it must  
necessarily rise in value, and bear a bet­  
ter price. The same may be said of the  
value of house rent, which will be ad­  
vanced for the same reasons; and by the  
Increase of trade and riches, people will  
be enabled to pay greater rents. Now,  
the value of house rent rising and Inter­  
est becoming low, many that In a scarcity  
of money practiced usury, will probably  
be more inclined to building; which will  
likewise sensibly enliven business in any  
place; It being an advantage, not only to  
brickmakers, brick layers, masons, car­  
penters, joiners, glaziers and several  
other trades immediately employed by  
building, but likewise to farmers, bakers,  
tailors, . shoemakers, shop keepers, and,  
in short, to everyone that they lay their  
money out with.  
Fourthly Want of money In such a  
country as ours, occasions a greater con­  
sumption of Englsh and European goods,  
In proportion to the number of people,  
than there would otherwise be. Because  
merchants&#x27; and traders, by whom an  
  
anizations.  
  
O  
51.00 PER YEAR.  
abundance of artificers are employed,  
finding their other affairs require what  
money they can get into , their hand3,  
oblige those who work for them to take  
one-half, or perhaps two-thirds goods In  
pay. By this means a greater quantity  
of goods are disposed of, and to a greater  
value; because working men and  
their families are thereby Induced  
to be more profuse and extravagant In  
fine apparel and the like, than they  
would be if they were obliged. to pay  
ready money for such things after they  
had earned and received it, or If such  
goods were not imposed upon them, of  
which they can make no other use. For  
such people cannot send the goods they  
are paid with to a foreign &#x27; market with­  
out losing considerably by having them  
sold for lees than they stand them la  
here; neither can they easily dispose of  
them at home, because their neighbors  
are generally supplied in the same man­  
ner. But how unreasonable would it be,  
If some of those very men who have been  
a means of thus forcing people Into un­  
necessary expense, should be the first  
and most earnest In accusing them of  
pride and prodigality. Now, though this  
extraordinary consumption of foreign  
commodities may be a profit to particu­  
lar men, yet the country in general grows  
poorer by it apace. On the contrary, as  
a plentiful currency will occasion a  
less consumption of European goods,  
In proportion to the number of people, so  
It will be a means of making the balance  
of our trade more equal than it now Is,  
if it docs not give It In our favor; because  
our own produce will be encouraged at  
the samo time. And, it is to be observed  
that, though less foreign commodities  
are consumed in proportion to the num  
ber of people, yet this will be no disad­  
vantage to the merchant, because the  
number of people increasing will occa­  
sion an Increasing demand for goods on  
the whole.  
Thus we have seen some of the many  
heavy disadvantages a country (especially  
such a country as ours) must labor under  
when it has not a sufficient stock of run­  
ning cash to manage Its trade currently.  
And we have likewise seen some of the  
advantages which accrue from having  
money sufficient, or a plentiful currency.  
The foregoing paragraphs being well  
considered, we shall naturally be led to  
draw the following conclusions with re­  
gard to what persons will probably be  
for or against emitting a large addi­  
tional sum of paper bills in this prov­  
ince: .  
First Since men will always be pow  
erfully Influenced In their opinions end  
Bctiom by what appears to be their r&quot;.

ticular Interest, therefore all those who,  
wanting courage to venture in trade, now  
practice lending money on security for  
exorbitant interest which, in a scarcity  
of money will be done, notwithstanding  
the law, I aay alt such will . probably be  
against a large addition to our present  
stock of money; because a plentiful cur­  
rency will lower interest, and make it  
common to lend on less security.  
Second All those who are possessors  
of large sums of money, and are disposed  
to purchase land, which is attended with  
a great and sure advantage In a growing  
country aa this is. I say the Interest of  
all such men will incline them to oppose  
a large addition to our money, because  
their wealth is now continually increas­  
ing by the large interest they receive,  
which will enable them (if they can keep  
land from rising) to purchase more  
eome time hence than they can at pres­  
ent; and, in the meantime, all trade being  
discouraged; not only those who borrow  
of them, but the common people in gen­  
eral, will be impoverished and conse­  
quently obliged to sell more land for less  
money than they will do at present.  
And yet, after such men are possessed of  
aa much land as they can purchase, It will  
then be their interest to have money  
made plentiful, because that will imme­  
diately make land rise in value in their  
hands. Now, it ought not to be won­  
dered at if people, from a knowledge of a  
man&#x27;s interest, do sometimes make a true  
gUessathis designs; for interest, they  
say, will not lie!  
Third Lawyers and others concerned  
in court business will probably, many of  
them, be against a plentiful currency;  
because people In that case will have less  
occasion to run in debt, and consequently  
less occasion to go to law and sue one an­  
other for their debts. Though I know  
some even among these gentlemen, that  
regard the public good before their own  
apparent interest  
Fourth All those who are anyways  
dependent on such persons as are above  
mentioned, whether as holding offices,  
as tenants, or as debtors, must at least  
appear to be against a large addition be­  
cause, If they do not, they must sensibly  
feel their present interest hurt And  
besides these, there are, doubtless, many  
well-meaning gentlemen and others who,  
without any immediate private Interest  
of their own In view, are against making  
such an addition, through an opinion  
they may have of the honesty and sound  
judgment of some of their friends that  
oppose it (perhaps for the ends afore­  
said), without having given it any thor­  
ough consideration themselves. And  
thus It is no wonder if there is a power­  
ful party on that side.  
Oh the other hand, those who are lov­  
ers of trade, and delight to see manufac­  
tures encouraged, will be for having a  
large addition to our currency. For  
they very well know that people will  
have little heart to advance money in  
trade, when what they can get is scarce  
sufficient to purchase necessaries, and  
supply their families with provisions.  
Much less will they lay It out in advanc­  
ing new manufactures; nor is It possible  
new manufactures should turn to any ac­  
count where there is not money to pay  
the workmen, who are discouraged by  
being paid in goods, because It is a great  
disadvantage to them.  
Again, those who are truly for the pro­  
prietor&#x27;s interest (and have no separate  
views of their own that are predominant)  
will be heartily for a large addition. Be­  
cause, as I have shown above, plenty of  
money will for several reasons&#x27;make land  
rise In value exceedingly. And I appeal  
to thoaa immediately concerned for the  
proprietor In the Bala of Ms linda,  
  
whether land has not risen since the first  
emissions of what paper currency we  
now have, and even by ita means. Now,  
we all know the proprietary has great  
quantities to sell.  
And since a plentiful currency will be  
so great a cause of advancing this  
province in trade and riches, and increas­  
ing the number of ita people, which,  
though it will not sensibly lessen the in­  
habitants of Great Britain, will occasion  
a much greater vent and demand for  
commodities here; and allowing that the  
crown is more powerful for its subjects  
increasing in wealth and number, I can­  
not think it the Interest of England to  
oppose us in making as great a sum of  
paper money here as we, who are the  
best judges of our own necessities, find  
convenient And If I were not sensible  
that the gentlemen of trade in England,  
to whom we have already parted with  
our silver and gold, are misinformed of  
our circumstances, and therefore en­  
deavor to have our currency stinted to  
what It now is, I should think the gov­  
ernment at home had some reasons for  
discouraging and impoverishing this  
province which we are not acquainted  
with.  
It remains now to inquire whether a  
large addition to our paper currency will  
make it sink in value very much. And  
here it will be requisite that we first  
form just notions of the nature and value  
of money in general.  
As providence has so ordered it, that  
not only different countries, but even dif­  
ferent parts of the same country, have  
their peculiar most suitable productions;  
and likewise that men have geniuses  
adapted to a variety of different arts and  
manufactures; therefore commerce, or  
the exchange of one commodity or man­  
ufacture for another, is highly conven­  
ient and beneficial to mankind. As for  
instance: A. may be skillful In the art  
of making cloth, and B. understand the  
raising of corn. A. wants corn andB.  
wants cloth; upon which they make an  
exchange with each other for as much as  
each has occasion for, to the mutual ad­  
vantage and satisfaction of both.  
But It would be very tedious if  
there were no other way of general deal­  
ing but by an Immediate change of com­  
modities; because a man that had corn to  
dispose of and wanted cloth for it might  
perhaps, in his search lor a chapman to  
deal with, meet with twenty people who  
had cloth to dispose of, but wanted no  
corn; and .with twenty others that wanted  
his corn but had no cloth to suit him  
with. To remedy such Inconveniences  
and facilitate exchange, men have in­  
vented money, properly called a medium  
of exchange, because through or by its  
means labor is exchanged for labor, or  
one commodity for another. And what­  
ever particular thing men have agreed to  
make this medium of, whether gold, sil­  
ver, copper or tobacco, it is, to those who  
possess it (if they want anything), that  
very thing which they want, because it  
will immediately procure it for them. It  
is cloth to him that wants cloth, and corn  
to those that want corn, and so of all  
other necessaries; It is whatsoever It will  
procure. Thus he who had corn to dis­  
pose of, and wanted to purchase cloth  
with it might sell his corn for ita value  
in this general medium, to one that  
wanted corn but had no cloth; and with  
this medium he might purchase cloth of  
him that wanted no corn, but perhaps  
some other thing, as iron, it maybe,  
which this medium will immediately  
procure, and so he may be said to have  
exchanged his cloth for iron; and thus  
the general change is soon performed, to  
the satisfaction of all parties, with  
abundance of facility.  
  
For many ages those parts of the  
world which are engaged in commerce  
have fixed upon gold and silver as the  
most proper materials for this medium;  
they being in themselves valuable metals  
for their fineness, beauty and scarcity.  
By these, particularly by silver, it has  
been usual to value all things else. But  
as silver itself is of no certain permanent  
value, being worth more or less ac­  
cording to its scarcity or plenty, there­  
fore It seems requisite to fix upon some­  
thing else, more proper to be made a  
measure of values, and this I take to be  
labor.  
By labor may the value of silver be  
measured as well as other things. As,  
snppose one man is employed to raise  
corn, while another is digging and refin­  
ing silver; at the year&#x27;s end, or at any  
other period of time, the complete pro­  
duce of corn, and that of silver, are the  
natural price of each other; and if one  
be twenty bushels and the other twenty  
ounces, then an ounce of that silver is  
worth the labor of raising a bushel of  
that corn. Now, if by the discovery of  
some nearer, more easy or more plenti­  
ful mines, a man may get forty ounces of  
silver as easily as formerly he did  
twenty, and the same labor is still re­  
quited to raise twenty bushels of corn,  
then two ounces of silver will be worth  
no more than the labor of raising one  
bushel of corn, and that bushel of corn  
will be as cheap at two ounces as it was  
before at one, cateris paribus.  
Thus the riches of a country are to  
be valued by the quantity of labor its in­  
habitants are able to purchase, and not  
by the quantity of silver or gold they  
possess; which will purchase more or  
lqss labor, and therefore is more or less  
valuable, as is . said before, according to  
Its scarcity or plenty. And those metals  
have grown much more plentiful in  
Europe since the.dlscovery of America, so  
they have sunk in value exceedingly ; for,  
to instance In England, formerly one  
penny of silver was worth a day&#x27;s labor,  
but now it Is hardly worth the sixth part  
of a day&#x27;s labor; because not less than  
sixpence will purchase the labor of a  
man for a day in any part of that king­  
dom; which is wholly to be attributed to  
the much greater plenty of money now  
in England than formerly. And yet per­  
haps England is in effect no richer now  
than at that time; because as much labor  
might be purchased or work got done of  
almost any kind, for 100 then, as will  
now require, or is now worth G00.  
In the next place, let us consider the  
nature of banks emitting bills of credit  
as they are at this time used in Ham­  
burgh, Amsterdam, London and Venice.  
Those places being seats of vast trade,  
and the payment of great sums being for  
that reason frequent bills of credit are  
found very&#x27; convenient in business; be­  
cause a great sum is more easily counted  
in them, lighter in carriage, concealed  
in less room,and therefore safer in travel­  
ing or laying up, and on many accounts  
they are very much valued. The banks  
are the general cashiers of all gentlemen,  
merchants &quot;and great traders in and about  
those cities; there they deposit their  
money, and may take out bills to this  
value, for which they can be certain to  
have money again at the bank at any  
time. This gives the bills a credit; so  
that In England they are never less valu­  
able than money, and in Venice and  
Amsterdam they are generally worth  
more. And the bankers, always reserv­  
ing money in hand to answer more than  
the common run of demands (and some  
people constantly putting in while others  
are taking out) are able besides to lend  
large sums on good security, to the gov­  
ernment or others, for a reasonable In  
  
terest by which they are paid for their  
care and trouble; and the money which  
otherwise would have lain dead in their  
hands, is made to circulate again there­  
by among the people. And thus the run­  
ning cash of the nation, is, as it were,  
doubled; for all great payments being  
made In bills, money is lower, trade be­  
comes more plentiful. And thisjs an ex­  
ceeding great advantage to a trading  
country that is not overstocked with gold  
and silver.  
Asthosewho take bills out of the  
banks in Europe, put in money for&quot; se­  
curity; so here, and In some of the neigh­  
boring provinces, we engage our land.  
Which of these methods will most ef­  
fectually secure the bills from actually  
sinking in value, comes next to be con­  
sidered.Trade in general being nothing else  
but the exchange of labor for labor, the  
value of all things is, as I have said be­  
fore, most justly measured by labor.  
Now suppose I put my money Into a  
bank, and take out a bill for the value;  
If this bill at the time of my receiving it  
would purchase me the labor of 100 men  
for twenty days, but some time after it  
will only purchase the labor of the same  
men for fifteen days, it is plain the bill  
has sunk in value one fourth part &#x27;Now  
silver and gold being of no permanent  
value, and as this bill is founded on  
money, and therefore to be esteemed as  
such, it may be that the occasion of this  
fall is the increasing plenty of gold and  
silver, by which money is one-fourth  
part less valuable than before, and there­  
fore one-fourth more is given of it for  
the same quantity of labor; and, if land  
Is not become more plentiful by some  
proportionate decrease of the people,  
one-fourth part more of money is given  
for the same quantity of land; whereby  
it appears that it would have been more  
profitable to me to have laid that money  
out in land which I put into the bank,  
than to place it there and take a bill for  
it And it is certain that the value of  
money has been continually sinking in  
England for several ages past because It  
has been continually increasing in quan­  
tity. But if bills could be taken out of  
a bank In Europe on a land security, it is  
probable the value of such bills would  
be more certain and steady, because the  
number of inhabitants continues to be  
near the same In those countries from  
age to age.  
For, as bills issued upon money securi­  
ty are money, so bills issued upon land  
are In effect coined land.  
Therefore (to apply the above to our  
own circumstances) if land In this  
province was falling, or any way likely  
to fall, it would behoove the Legislature  
most carefully to contrive how to pre­  
vent the bills Issued upon land  
from falling with it But as our people  
Increase exceedingly, and will be further  
increased, as I have before shown, by  
the help of a large addition to our cur­  
rency, and as land in consequence is con­  
tinually rising, so, In case no bills are  
emitted but what are upon land security,  
the money acts in every part punctually  
enforced and executed, the payments of  
principal and interest being duly and  
strictly required, and the principal bona  
fide sunk according to law, it is absolutely  
impossible such bills should ever sink  
below their first value, or below the  
value of the land on which they are  
founded. In short there is so little dan­  
ger of their sinking that they would cer­  
tainly riae as the land rises, if they were  
not emited in a proper manner for pre­  
venting it That is, by providing in the  
act that payment may be made either in  
those bills or in any other bills made  
made current by any act of the Legiah

ture of this province; and that the inter­  
est, as it ia received, may be again emit­  
ted in discharge of public debts; where­  
by circulating, it returns again into the  
hands of the borrowers, and becomes  
part of their future payments; and thus,  
as it is likely there will not be any diffi­  
culty for want of bills to pay the office,  
they are thereby kept from rising above  
their first value. For else, supposing  
there should be emitted upon mortgaged  
land its full present value in bills, as in  
the banks of Europe the full value of the  
money deposited is given out in bills;  
and supposing the office would take  
nothing but the same sum in those bills  
  
in discharge of the land, as, In the banks  
aforesaid, the same sum in their bills  
must be brought in, in order to receive  
out the money; in such case the bills  
would most Burely rise in value as the  
land rises; as certainly as the bank bills  
founded on money would fall, if that  
money was falling. Thus, if 1 were to  
mortgage to a loan office, or bank, a par­  
cel of land now valued at 100 in silver,  
and receive for it the like sum In bills,  
  
to be paid in again at the expiration of a  
certain term of years, before which my  
  
land rising in value, becomes worth 150  
  
in silver; it is plain that if I have not  
those bills in possession, and the office  
will take nothing but those bills, or else  
what it is now become worth in silver in  
discharging of my land; I say it appears  
  
plain that those bills will now be worth  
150 in silver to the possessor; and if I  
  
can purchase them for less, in order to  
  
redeem my land, I shall by so much be a  
  
gainer. .  
  
I need not say anything to convince  
  
the judicious that our bills have not yet  
  
sunk, though there is and has been  
  
some difference between them and silver;  
  
because it is evident that that difference  
is occasioned by the scarcity of the latter,  
  
which la now become a merchandise,  
rising and falling like other commodities  
  
as there is greater or less demand for it,  
  
or as it is more or less plenty.  
  
Yet further, In order to make a true  
estimate of the value of money, we must  
distinguish between money as it is bul  
  
lion, which is merchandise, and as by be  
  
lng coined it is made a currency. For its  
  
value as a merchandise and its value as a  
  
currency are two distinct things; and  
  
each may possibly rise and fall in some  
  
degree independent of the other. Thus,  
If the quantity of bullion increases in the  
country, it will proportionately decrease  
  
in value; but if at the same time the  
  
quantity of current coin should decrease  
(supposing payments may not be made In  
  
bullion) what coin there is will rise in  
  
value as currency; that Is, people will  
give more labor In manufacturej for a  
  
certain sum of ready money.  
  
In the same manner must we consider  
- a paper currency founded on land; as It  
  
is land, and aa it Is a currency.  
  
Money as bullion, or as land, is valua­  
ble by so much labor as It costs to pro  
  
cure that bullion or land.  
Honey as a currency has an additional  
  
value by so much time and labor as it  
  
saves in the exchange of commonditles.  
  
If, as a currency, It saves one-fourta  
part of the time and labor of a country;  
it has, on that account, one-fourth added  
  
to Its original value.  
  
When there is no money in a country,  
to exchange or get their commodities ex­  
changed; then in computing their value  
the labor of exchanging must be added  
  
to the labor of manufacturing those com  
  
modifies. But if that time or labor Is  
saved by introducing money sufficient,  
  
then the additional value on account of  
  
the labor of exchanging may be abated,  
  
and things sold for only the value of the  
  
hbor la making them; because the peo  
  
ple may now in the same time make one­  
fourth more In quantity of manufactures  
than they could before.  
From these considerations it may be  
gathered that in all the degrees between  
having no money In a country, and hav­  
ing sufficient for the trade, It will rise  
and fall in value as a currency in pro­  
portion to the decrease or increase of its  
quantity. And if there may be at some  
time more than enough, the overplus will  
  
have no effect towards making the cur­  
rency, as a currency, of less value than  
when there was but enough; because  
such overplus will not be used in trade,  
but be some other way disposed of.  
  
If we inquire how much per cent in­  
terest ought to be required upon the  
loan of those bills, we must consider  
what is the natural standard of usury.  
And this appears to be, where the securi­  
ty is undoubted, at least the rent of so  
much land as the money lent will buy.  
For it cannot be expected that any man  
will lend his money for less than it  
  
would fetch him In as rent 11 he laid It  
out in land, which is the- most secure  
  
property In the world. But If the se  
  
curity is casual, then a kind of insurance  
must be Interwoven with the simple  
natural interest, which may advance the  
  
usury very consclonably to any height  
below the principal itself. Now among  
us If the value of land is twenty years&#x27;  
  
purchase, 5 per cent, is the just rate of  
  
interest for money lent on undoubted se  
  
curity. Yet If money grows scarce in a  
country, it becomes more difficult for  
  
people to make punctual payments of  
  
what they borrow, money being hard to  
be raised; likewise, trade being discour  
  
aged and business impeded for want of a  
  
currency, abundance of people must be  
  
declining In circumstances, and by these  
  
means of security is more precarious  
than where money is plenty. On such  
  
It is no wonder if people aak a greater in  
  
terest for their money than the natural  
  
interest; and what Is above is to be  
  
looked upon as a kind of premium for  
the Insurance of those uncertainties, as  
  
they are greater or less. Thus we al  
ways see that where money Is scarce In  
  
terest is high and low where It Is plenty.  
Now it is certainly the advantage of a  
  
country to make interest as lo y as possl  
  
ble, as I have already shown; and this  
  
ca . be done no other way than by making  
money plentiful. And since, in emitting  
  
paper money among us, the office has  
  
the best of security, the titles of the  
  
land being skillfully and strictly exam  
  
ined and ascertained; and as it is only  
  
permitting the people by law to coin  
their own land, which costs the govern  
  
ment nothing, the interest being more  
  
than enough to pay the charge of print  
  
ing, officers&#x27; fees, etc. I cannot see any  
  
good reason why 4 per cent, to the loan  
  
office should not be thought fully suffl  
  
cient. As a low interest may incline  
more to take money out, it will become  
more plentiful In trade; and this may  
  
bring down the common usury, in which  
security Is more dubious to the pitch it is  
determined at by law.  
If it should be objected that emitting  
it at so low an interest, and on such  
easy terms will occasion more to be  
taken out than the trade of the country  
really requires; It may be answered that  
as has already been shown, there can  
never be so much of it emitted as to  
make it fall below the land It Is founded  
on; because no man In bis senses will  
mortgage his estate for what is of no  
more value to him than that he has  
mortgaged, especially If the possession of  
of what he received is more precarious  
than what he mortgages, as that of paper  
money Is when compared to land. And  
If it should ever become so plentiful by  
  
indiscreet persons continuing to take out  
&amp; large overplus, above what is necessary  
In trade so as to make people imagine It  
would become by that means of less  
value than their mortgaged lands, tttey  
would Immediately of course begin to  
  
pay It in again to redeem their land, and  
continue to do so till there was no more  
  
left in trade than was absolutely neces­  
sary. And thus the proportion would  
find itself (though there were a million  
too much In the office to be let out) with­  
out giving anyone the trouble ofcalculation.  
  
It may perhaps be objected to what I  
  
have written concerning the advantages  
of a large addition to our currency that  
  
if the people of this province increase  
and husbandry is more followed, we shall  
  
overstock the markets with our produce  
  
of flour, etc To this it may be answered  
  
that we can never have too many people  
  
(nor too much money.) For when one  
  
branoh of trade or business la over  
  
stocked with hands, there are the more  
  
to spare to be employed in another. So  
  
if raising wheat proves dull, more may  
(If there is money to support and carry  
  
on new manufactures) proceed to the  
  
raising and manufacturing of hemp, silk,  
Iron and many other things the country  
Is very capable of, for which we only  
  
want people to work and money to pay  
  
them with.  
  
Upon the whole It may be observed,  
  
that it is the highest Interest of a trad  
  
lng country In general to make money  
  
plentiful; and that it can be a dlsadvan  
  
tage to none that have honest designs.  
It cannot hurt even the usurers, though  
  
It should sink what they receive as in  
  
terest; because they will be proportion  
  
ably more secure In what -they lend, or  
  
they will have an opportunity of employ  
  
ing their money to greater advantages to  
  
themselves as well as to the country,  
  
Neither can it hurt those merchants who  
  
have great sums outstanding in debts in  
  
the country, and seem on that account to  
  
have the most plausible reason to fear  
  
it, to wit, because a large addition being  
  
made to our currency will Increase the  
  
demand for our exporting produce, and  
  
by that means raise the price of it, so  
that they will not be able to purchase so  
much bread or flour with 100, when  
  
they shall receive It after such an addi  
  
tion, aa they now can, and may If there  
  
Is no addition. I say It cannot hurt even  
  
such, because they will get in their  
  
debts just In exact proportion so much  
  
the sooner as the money becomes plen-  
  
(ler; and therefore, considering the in  
  
terest and trouble saved, they will not be  
losers; because it only sinks In value as  
  
currency proportionally as it becomes  
  
more plenty. It cannot hurt the Interest  
  
of Great Britain, as has been shown; and  
it will greatly advance the Interest of the  
proprietor. It will be an advantage to  
  
every Industrious tradejman, etc., be  
  
cause his business will be carried on  
  
more freely and trade be universally en  
  
livened by it. And as more business in  
all - manufactures will be done, by  
so much as the labor and  
time spent in exchange Is saved  
the country In ge aeral will grow so much  
  
the richer.  
  
It is nothing to the purpose to object  
to the wretched fall of the bills in New  
England and South Carolina, unless It  
might be made evident that currency  
  
was emitted with the same prudence,  
  
and on such good security as ours Is; and  
  
It certainly was not.  
  
As this eesay ia written and published  
  
In haste, and the subject in Itself intrl  
  
cate, I hope I shall be censured with  
  
candor, If, for want of time carefully to  
revise what I have written, In some places  
I should p&#x27;ppesr to have exprested my.  
  
self too obscurely, and in others am liable  
to objections I did not foresee, I sin­  
cerely desire to be acquainted with the  
truth, and on that account shall think:  
  
myself obliged to any one, who will take  
the pains to show me or the public, where  
  
I am mistaken in my conclusions.&#x27; And  
  
as we all know there are among us several  
  
gentlemen of acute parts and profound  
learning, who are very much against any  
addition to our money, It were to be  
wished that they would favor the country  
with their sentiments on this head in  
  
print; which, supported with truth and  
good reasoning, may probably be very  
convincing. And this is to be desired  
the rather because many people, knowing  
the abilities of these gentlemen to manage  
  
a good cause, are apt to construe tneir  
silence in this, as an argument of a bad  
one. Had anything of that kind ever yet  
appeared, perhaps I should not have  
given the public this trouble. But, as  
  
uxose ingenious gentlemen nave nu yok  
  
(anal doubt never will) tntnic it worm  
their concern to enlighten the minds of  
their erring countrymen in this particular,  
  
I think It would be highly commenaaDia  
In everyone of us, more fully to bend our  
minds to the study of what is the true In­  
terest cf Pennsylvania, whereby we may  
  
be enabled, not only to reason pertinently  
with one another, but if occasion requires,  
to transmit home such clear representa­  
tions, as must inevitably convince our  
  
superiors of the reasonableness ana in­  
tegrity of our designs.

land, to the injury of all creditors. We had dis­  
eased this point In our junto, where I was on  
the side of an addition, belnjj persuaded that the  
first small sum struck In 1723 had done much  
good by Increasing trade, employment, and  
number of Inhabitants In the province; since I  
now saw all the old houses inhabited, and many  
new ones building; whereas I remembered well  
when I first walked about the streets of Phila­  
delphia (eating my roll), I saw many of the  
houses in Walnut street, between Second and  
Front streets, with bills on their doors, &quot;To be  
Let;&quot; and many likewise in Chestnut street and  
other streets, which made ma think that the In­  
habitants of the city were one after another de­  
serting it. Our debates possessed me so fully on

money Benjamin Franklin continues as  
follows: “We shall naturally be led to  
draw the following conclusions with re­  
gard to what persons will probably be  
for or against emiting a large addi­  
tional sum of paper bills in this prov­  
ince:  
  
First—Since men will always be  
powerfully influenced in their opinions  
and actions by what appears to be  
their particular interest, therefore all  
those who, wanting courage to venture  
in trade, now practice lending money  
on security for exhorbitant interest,  
which, in a scarcity of money will be  
done, notwithstanding the law, I say  
all such will probably be against a  
large addition to our present stock of  
money; because a plentiful currency  
will lower interest, and make it com­  
mon to lend on less security.  
Second—All those who are posses­  
sors of large sums of money, and are  
disposed to purchase land, which is  
attended with a great and sure advan­  
tage in a growing country as this is.  
I say the interest of all such men will  
incline them to oppose a large addition  
to our money, because their wealth is  
now continually increasing by the  
large interest they receive, which will  
enable them (if they can keep land  
from rising) to purchase more some  
time hence than they can at present;  
and, in the meantime, all trade being  
ciscouraged; not only those who bor­  
row of them, but the common people  
in general, will be impoverished and  
consequently obliged to sell more land  
for less money than they will do at  
present. And yeL after such men are  
possessed of as much land as they can  
purchase, it will then be their interest  
to have money made plentiful, be­  
cause that will immediately make land  
rise in value in their hands. Now, it  
ought not to be wondered at if people,  
from a knowledge of a man’s interest,  
do sometimes make a true guess at his  
designs, for interest, they say, will  
not lie!  
  
Third—Lawyers and others con­  
cerned in court business will probably,  
many of them, be against a plentiful  
currency; because people in that case  
will have less occasion to run in debt,  
and consequently less occasion to go  
to law and sue one another for their  
debts. Though I know some even  
among these gentlemen, that regard  
the public good before their own ap­  
parent interest.  
  
Fourth—All those who are anyways  
dependent on such persons as are above  
mentioned, whether as holding offices,  
as tenants or as debtors, must at least  
appear to be against a large addition;  
because, if they do not, they must  
sensibly feel their present interest hurt.  
And besides these there are, doubtless,  
many well-meaning gentlemen and  
others who, without any immediate  
private interest of their own in view,  
are against making such an addition,  
through an opinion they may have of  
the honesty and sound judgment of  
some of their friends that oppose it  
(perhaps for the ends aforesaid), with­  
out having given it any thorough con­  
sideration themselves. And thus it is  
no wonder if there is a powerful party  
on that side.  
  
On the other hand, those who are  
lovers of trade, and delight to see  
manufactures encouraged, will be for  
having a large addition to our currency.  
For they very well know that people  
will have little heart to advance money  
in trade, when what they can get is  
scarce sufficient to purchase neces­  
saries, and supply their families with  
provisions. Much less will they lay it  
out in advancing new manufactures;  
nor is it possible new manufactures  
should turn to any account where there  
is not money to pay the workmen, who  
are discouraged by being paid in goods,  
because it is a great disadvantage to  
them.—Topeka Advocate.

tion for their present resurrection.  
  
Franklin, writing in 1729* in defence of a paper currency, says: ‘‘On  
the contrary, as a plentiful currency will occasion a less consumption  
of European goods in proportion to the number of people, so it will  
be the means of making the balance of our trade more equal than it  
now is.’’ Here we have, at least by implication, the old notion that  
for any country to have the balance of trade against it, is an unmiti-  
gated evil.  
  
sovernor Pownall,f on the other hand, held that there were condi-  
tions under which this fact that the balance of trade was against a  
country, might be evidence of its progress and prosperity. In 1765,  
in his ‘‘Administration of the Colonies,” page 110 of the second edi-  
tion, he writes: ‘‘An increasing country of settlers and traders must  
always have the balance of trade against them, for this very reason,

It was of course impossible to get very far in the discussion of money,  
without assuming some theory of value. Franklin in his paper of  
1729 t writes :  
  
“A wants corn and B cloth; upon which they make an exchange  
with each other, for as much as each has occasion for, to the mutual  
advantage and satisfaction of both; . . . to facilitate this exchange  
men have invented money properly called a medium of exchange...

‘For many ages those parts of the world which are engaged in com-  
merce have fixed upon gold and silver as the chief and most proper  
material for this medium ; they being in themselves-valuable metals  
for their fineness, beauty and scarcity. By these, particularly by silver,  
it has been usual to value all things else. But as silver itself is of no  
certain permanent value, being worth more or less according to its  
scarcity or plenty, therefore it seems necessary to fix upon something  
else, more proper to be made a measure of value, and this I take to  
be labor.’ . . . He then continues: ‘‘ Yet further, in order to make a  
true estimate of the value of money, we must distinguish between  
money as it is bullion, which is merchandise, and as being coined it is  
made acurrency. For its value asa merchandise, and its value as a  
currency, are two distinct things ; and each may possibly rise and fall  
in some degree independent of the other. . .  
  
‘*In the same manner must we consider a paper currency, founded  
upon land ; as it is land and as it is a currency.  
  
** Money as bullion or as land is valuable dy so much labor as it costs  
to procure that bullion or land.  
  
** Money as currency has an additional value dy so much time and  
labor as it saves in the exchange of commodities.’’  
  
Tench Francis, in a paper entitled * ‘‘ Considerations on a Paper  
Currency,’’ bases his theory of money upon the opposite theory of  
value, namely, that “ value depends entirely upon utility.’? The paper  
opens as follows: ‘‘All value is given to things for their fitness or  
power to answer or procure the necessary conveniences or pleasures of  
human life.  
  
‘*This value may be considered as absolute or relative. Absolute  
value terminates in our esteem for anything, without referring to any  
other; relative is that which it has compared with another. Th

He says: “ To make a true estimate of the value of money  
we must distinguish between money as it is bullion which is  
merchandise, and as by being coined it is made a currency.  
For its value as a merchandise and its value as a currency  
are two distinct things, and each may possibly rise and fall  
in some degree independent of the other. Thus if the quan-  
tity of bullion increases in a country it will proportionately  
decrease in value; but if at the same time the quantity of  
current coin should decrease (supposing payments may not  
be made in bullion), what coin there is will rise in value as a  
currency.” “ Money as bullion or as land,” he continues, “ is  
valuable by so much labor as it costs to procure that bullion  
or land. Money as a currency has an additional value by  
so much time and labor as it saves in the exchange of com-  
modities.” If money as a currency saves one-fourth of the  
time and labor of a country (which under a system of barter  
would be spent in hunting suitable persons with whom to  
exchange), it must on that account have one-fourth added to  
its original value.

For many ages, those parts of the world which are engaged in com-  
merce, have fixed upon gold and silver as the chief and most proper  
materials for this medium; they being in themselves valuable metals,  
for their fineness, beauty and scarcity. By these, particularly by  
silver, it has been usual to value all things else. But as silver itself is  
of no certain permanent value, being worth more or less according to  
its scarcity or plenty, therefore it seems necessary to fix upon some-  
thing else, more proper to be made a measure of values, and this I  
take to be labor.

If it should be objected that emitting at so low a rate of interest,

already been shown, there can never be so much of it emitted as to  
make it fall below the land it is founded on; because no man in his

become so plenty by indiscreet persons continuing to take out a large  
overplus above what is necessary in trade, so as to make people  
imagine it would become by that means of less value than their mort-

there was no more left in trade than was absolutely necessary. And
