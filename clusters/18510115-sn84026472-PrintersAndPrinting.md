which you may soon undergo.  
  
It is now that you may understand the  
magnificent language of Heaven—it mingles  
its voice with that of Revelation—it sum-  
mons you to those hours when the leaves fall  
and the Winter is gathering, to that evening  
study which the mercy of Heaven has pro-  
vided in the Book of Salvation. And while  
the shadowy valley opens, which leads to the  
abode of death, it speaks of that love which  
can camfort and save, and which can conduct

where there is an eternal spring for the chil-

Reminiscences, in course of publication in

of the printer to authors, and also of the re-  
  
quital of their labors by the public generally,  
as follows :—  
  
Many, who condescend to illuminate the  
dark world with the fire of their genius,  
through the columns of a newspaper, little  
think of the lot of the printer, who, almost  
suffocated by the smoke of the lamp, sits up  
till midnight to correct his false grammar, bad  
orthography, and worse punctuation. I have  
seen the arguments of lawyers, in high repute  
as scholars, sent to the printer in their own  
handwriting, many words—and especiall  
technical and foreign cacanereiiiiaatiied,  
words misspelled, and few or no points, and  
those few, if there are any, entirely out of  
place. Ihave seen the sermons of eminent  
Divines, sent tothe press, without points or  
capitals to designate the division of the sen-  
tences—sermons which, if published with the  
imperfections of the manuscript, would dis-  
grace the printer&#x27;s devil if he were the au-  
thor. Suppose they had been so printed.  
The printer would have been treated with  
scorn and contempt as an illiterate blockhead  
  
‘—as a fellow better fitted to be a wood-saw-  
  
“a than a printer. Nobody would have be-  
ieved that such gross and palpable faults were  
owing to the ignorance or carelessness of the  
author. And no one but the practical printer  
knows how many hours a compositor, and af-

words misspelled, and few or no points  
and those few, if there were any, entirely  
out of place. I have seen the sermons  
of eminent “ divines ” sent to the press  
without points or capitals to designate  
the division of sentences—sermons which,  
if published with the imperfections of the  
manuscript, would disgrace the printer’s

they had been so printed. The printer  
would have been treated with scorn and

. This is the natural  
progress. It is by attempting to reach  
the top at a single leap, that so much  
misery is produced in the world. So­  
ciety may aid in making the laborers  
virtuous and happy, by bringing chil­  
dren up to labor with steadiness, with  
care and with skill; to show them how  
to do as many useful things as possible;  
to do them all in the best manner; to  
set them an example in industry, sobri­  
ety, cleanliness and neatness; to make  
all these habitual to them, so that they  
never shall be liable to fall into the  
contrary; to let them always see a good

to the printer in their own hand writing,  
many words- and especially technical and  
foreign terms--abbreviated, words mis­  
spelled, and few or no points, and those  
few, if there are any, entirely out of place.  
I have seen the sermons of divines sent to  
the press without points or capitals to de­  
signate the division of sentences; sermons  
which, if published with the imperfections  
of the mannscript, would disgrace the prin­  
ter&#x27;s devil if he were the author. Suppose  
they had been so printed. The printer  
would have been treated with scorn and  
contempt, as an illiterate blockhead--as a  
fellow better fitted to be a woodsawyer  
than a printer. Nobody would have be­  
lieved that such gross and palpable faults  
were owing to the ignorance and careless­  
ness of the author. And no one but the  
practical printer knows how many hours  
the compositors, and after him the proof­  
reader, is compelled to spend, in reducing  
to a readable condition manuscripts that  
the writer himself would be puzzled to  
read.

shoals of ambition, by which first rates and frigates  
are frequently demolished; when they cut their  
cables on being drawn into gaming, and scud away  
with all their sails spread, from the gulf of ruin, in  
which thousands and ten thousands are tumbled,  
lost, and totally destroyed; we may venture to say of  
‘this pair, that they make a very good conjugal  
voyage through life and stand a fair chance to die  
in the harbor of felicity.  
  
PriNTERS AND PrINTING.—J. T. Buckingham  
in his Reminiscences, in the course of publication  
in the “ Boston Courier,” speaks of the importance  
of the printer to authors, as follows:  
“Many who condescend to illuminate the dark  
world with the fire of their genius through the col­  
ums of a newspaper, little think of the lot of the  
printer, who, almost suffocated by the smoke of a  
lamp, sits up till midnight to correct his false gram­  
mar, bad authography, and worse punctuation, I  
have seen the arguments of lawyers, in high repute  
as scholars, sent to the printer in their own hand­  
writing, many words—and especially technical and  
foreign terms—abbreviated ; words mis-spelled, and  
a few or no points, and those few, if there are any,  
entirely out of place. I have seen the sermons of  
divines sent to the press without points or capitals  
to designate the division of sentences ; sermons which  
if published with theimperfections of the manuscript  
would disgrace the printer’s devil if he were the au­  
thor. Suppose they had been printed. The prin­  
ter would have been treated ‘with scorn and con­  
tempt, as an illiterate blockhead-—as a fellow better  
fitted to be a wood-sawyer than a printer. Nobody  
would have believed that such groos and palpable  
faults were owing to the ignorance and carelessness  
of the author. And no one but the practical prin­  
ter knows how many hours the compositor, and af­  
ter him the proof reader, is compelled to spend in  
reducing to a readable condition, manuscripts that  
the writer himself would be puzzled to read.”

perfections of the manuscript, would disgrace the  
printer’s devil if he were the author. Suppose  
they had been printed: the printer would have

not laziness, it is ignorance that compels writers to

neither punctuate, spell nor write grammatically—  
to say nothing of their sprawling penmanship.—  
And as might be expected, these are generally the  
ones to find the most fault and put on the most  
disgusting airs—we say disgusting because they are  
so to all sensible men—but those who assun.e them  
think them dignified ! It is no small annoyance to  
have anything to do with such characters—and we

correct an author’s manuscript. But we suppose

Memoirs and Itacollections of Editorial  
Lite,” makes the following mention ol  
Journeymen Printers, a most worthy  
class of mechanics who always found n  
friend in the author of this pleasant book.  
Many persons, who condescend to  
illumine the dark world with the spaik­  
ling* of their genius through the columns  
of a newspaper, and others who publish  
sermons and tracts, religious, moral and  
political, little think of the labor of the  
printer, who sits up till midnight or till  
Jay light, to correct his false grammar,  
bad orthography, and worse punctuation.  
I once saw the manuscript of n ser  
mon in the hands of a printer, which  
was entirely without points, and every  
ine began with » capital letter, as if it  
!md been poetry. Suppose these pro­  
ductions had been printed as they were  
written. The disgrace would have fall­  
en upon the printer.  
After an experience of more than fifty  
pears, I “hold this truth to be self evi­  
dent,” that there is no class of working  
men so poorly paid as printers. For  
one who makes liim-eIf rich by printing  
disconnected with the business of pub­  
lishing, ffty barely live above poverty,  
and die in the possession of little more  
■linn enough lo pay the joiner for a coffin

 given  
utterance to the experience of every editor in  
the following paragraph, which is brimfull of  
truth:  
&quot;Many persons who condescend to illumine the  
dark world with the sparklings of their genius through  
the columns of a newspaper, and others who publish  
sermons and tracts--religious, moral and political  
little think of the labor of the printer, who (perhaps  
nearly suffocated with the smoke a lamp, and with an  
aching head, and eyes inflamed and enfeebled from  
intense application) sits up till midnight, or till day­  
light, to correct his false grammar, bad orthography  
and worse punc uation. I have seen the arguments  
of lawyers, who stood in high repute as scholars, sent  
to the printer in their own handwriting,-chirography  
which would defy the sagacity of the most inveterafe  
investigator of ancient hieroglyphics,-abounding with  
technical and foreign terms abbreviated, words mis­  
spelled, and few (or no) points, and those few entirely  
misplaced. I once saw the manuscript of a sermon  
in the hands of a printer, which was entirely without  
points, and every line began with a capital letter, as  
if it had been poetry. Suppose theee productions

This in whole or part, will apply to

Authors and Printers.  
To those who arc inclined to grumble be­  
cause a slight mistako may happen to occur  
in any allegible written article they may bo  
disposed to send some newspaper, we wonld  
commend tbe following from .the “ Remin­  
lscenses &quot; ofT. J. Buckingham “Many  
who condescend to illuminate the dark  
world with the fire of tbeir genius through  
the columns of little think of  
the lot of the printer, who, almost suffocat­  
ed with the smoke of a lamp, sits up till  
midnight to correct bad orthography and ;  
worse punctuation. I have seen the  
arguments of lawyers, in high repute as  
scholars, sent to the prinier, in their own ,  
hand-writing, with many words—especially ,  
technical and foreign terms—abbreviated,  
words mis-spelled, and few or no points,  
and those few, if there were any, entirely  
out ol&#x27;place. I have seen the sermons of  
divines scut to press withont points or cap­  
itals to designate the divisions ofsentences; j  
Bermons which, published with the imper- (  
fections of the manuscript, would disgrace  
the printer’s devil, if he were tho author.— ,  
Suppose they had been printed ; the prin- i  
ter would have been treated with scorn and  
contempt—as an illiterate blockhead—a (  
fellow better fitted to be a wood-sawyer ,  
than a printer. Nobody would have believ- j  
ed such gross and palpable faults were ow­  
ing to the ignorance or carelessness ofan au- ,  
thor. And no one but a practical printer (  
knows how many hours the compositor,  
and after him the proof-reader, is compell- (  
ed to spend in reducing to a readable con- ,  
dition manuscript that tho writer himself t  
would be puzzled to read.” t  
This, in whole or in part, will apply to at  
least two-thiffds of the writers for the press. ,  
Genius is too apt to consider itself too E  
good to be troubled with the labor of finish­  
ing its work, notwithstanding it is the fin- t  
ishing hand that gives the master stroke.— .  
But too frequently, however, it is not lazi- {  
ness, it is ignorance that compels writers ,  
to leave their performances half done. Ma­  
ny who have something of a reputation as  
authors, can neither punctuate, spell, or  
write grammatically—to say nothing of  
tbeir scrawling penmanship. And as  
might be expected, these are generally tho I  
ones to find ihe most fault, aud put on the i  
most disgusting airs—we say disgusting, i  
because they are to all sensible men* but  
those who assume them think them digni- &#x27;  
fied ! It is uo small annoyance to have  
anything to do with such characters—  
and we have sometimes wished it was a  
penal offence to correct an author’s manu­  
script. But we suppose we shall always  
be bothered with the stupidity of the wise.

reputation as authors, can neither  
punctuate, spell or write gramatically  
-to say nothing of their sprawling  
penmanship. And as might be expect­

engine runs a press that will print about  
400 papers an hour. They consider this  
a big thing in Mexico, and point with  
wonder at the gigantic enterprise of the  
company that lias a steam press. A  
paper of this class sometimes gets an  
item of news as soon as three days after  
it happens, and in other ways shows ex­  
traordinary energy. As only about one

while  
yet a young woman, when I and my broth­  
er were small boys, but I remember her  
face. I was successful in making the  
side leap of my arms, when I drew my  
self upon the ledge and rested for a time.  
From here upward my climbing way was  
laborious, but less dangerous. I reached  
the top of the canon just as the sun was  
sinking down behind the snowy range,  
and hastened to our camp at the mouth of  
the canon, where I found my brother all  
safe. ‘Charley,’ said he, ‘have you had  
your head in a flour sack V it was then  
I discovered that my hair was as white  
as you see it now.”  
PRINTERS and PRINTING.—Many who  
condescend to illuminate this dark world  
with the fire of their genius through the  
columns of a newspaper, little think of the  
lot of the printer who sits up at midnight  
to correct their false grammar and  
orthography and worse punctuation. We  
have seen the arguments of lawyers in  
high repute as scholars, sent to the printer  
in their own handwriting, many words—  
especially technical and foreign terms—  
abbreviated, words misspelled and few, if  
any, certainly in the wrong place. We  
have seen the sermons of eminent divines  
sent to the press without points or capitals  
to designate the division of the sentences;  
also the letters of the political and  
scientific correspondents. Suppose all  
these had been so printed—the printer  
would have been treated with scorn and  
contempt No, one would have believed  
that such gross and palpable faults were  
owing to the ignorance or carelessness of the  
author and no one but the practical printer  
knows how many hours the compositor,
