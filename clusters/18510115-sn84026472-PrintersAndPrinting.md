—f PRINTERS AND PRINTING.  
J. T. Buckingham, Esq., in his series of  
Reminiscences, in course of publication in  
  
the Boston Courier, speaks of the importance  
of the printer to authors, and also of the re-  
  
quital of their labors by the public generally,  
as follows :—  
  
Many, who condescend to illuminate the  
dark world with the fire of their genius,  
through the columns of a newspaper, little  
think of the lot of the printer, who, almost  
suffocated by the smoke of the lamp, sits up  
till midnight to correct his false grammar, bad  
orthography, and worse punctuation. I have  
seen the arguments of lawyers, in high repute  
as scholars, sent to the printer in their own  
handwriting, many words—and especiall  
technical and foreign cacanereiiiiaatiied,  
words misspelled, and few or no points, and  
those few, if there are any, entirely out of  
place. Ihave seen the sermons of eminent  
Divines, sent tothe press, without points or  
capitals to designate the division of the sen-  
tences—sermons which, if published with the  
imperfections of the manuscript, would dis-  
grace the printer&#x27;s devil if he were the au-  
thor. Suppose they had been so printed.  
The printer would have been treated with  
scorn and contempt as an illiterate blockhead  
  
‘—as a fellow better fitted to be a wood-saw-  
  
“a than a printer. Nobody would have be-  
ieved that such gross and palpable faults were  
owing to the ignorance or carelessness of the  
author. And no one but the practical printer  
knows how many hours a compositor, and af-  
ter him the proof reader, is compelled to  
spend in reducing to a readable condition,  
manuscripts that the writers themselves would  
be puzzled to read.

to the dark world with the lire of his  
genius, through the columns of a news­

printer, who sits up till midnight to  
correct their false grammar, bad or

were any, certainly out of place. I have  
seen the sermons of eminent divines  
sent to the press without points or

the sentence; also the letters of politic

printer would have been treated with

have believed that such gross and palp
