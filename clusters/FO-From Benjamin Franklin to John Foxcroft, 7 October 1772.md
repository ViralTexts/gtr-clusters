I had no Line from you by this last Packet, but find with Pleasure by yours [to] Mr. Todd that you and yours were well.  
The Affair of the Patent is in good Train, and we hope, if new Difficulties unexpected do not arise, we may get thro’ it as soon as the Board meet. We are glad you made no Bargain [about] your Share, and hope none of our Partners there [will] do any such Thing; for the Report of such a Bargain here before the Business is compleated might overset the whole.  
Mr. Colden has promised by this Packet that we shall certainly have the Accounts per the next. If they do not come, I think we shall be blam’d, and he will be superseded: For their Lordships our Master, are incens’d at the long Delay.  
I hope you have by this time examin’d our private Account as you promis’d, and satisfy’d yourself that I did, as I certainly did, pay you that Ballance of about £389 in my own Wrong. It would relieve me of some Uneasiness to have this Matter settled between us, as it is a Sum of Importance, and in case of Death might be not so easily understood as while we are both in being. With Love to my Daughter and best Wishes of Prosperity to you both, and to the little one, I am ever, my dear Friend, Yours most affectionately  
B Franklin

1 had no line from you by this last Packet, but find with Pleasure  
by yours to Mr. Todd that you and yours are well.  
  
The affair of the Patent is in good Train and we hope, if new Difficulties  
unexpected do not arise, we may get thro’ it as soon as the Board meet. We  
are glad you made no Bargain [torn] your Share and hope none of our Partners  
[torn] do any such thing; for the Keport of such a Bargain before the Business  
is completed might overset the whole.  
  
Mr. Colden has promised by this Packet that we shall certainly have the  
Accounts by the next. If they do not come I think we shall be blamed, and he  
Me be superseded; For their Lordships our masters are incensed with the long  
  
elay.  
1 hope you have by this time examined our private Accounts as you promised,  
and satisfyd yourself that I did, as I certainly did, pay you that Ballance of  
about 3894 in my own wrong. It would relieve me of some uneasiness to have  
the Matter settled between us, as it is a Sum of Importance and in case of Death  
might be not so easily understood as while we are both living.  
  
With love to my Daughter and best Wishes of Prosperity to you both, and  
to the little one, 1 am ever my dear Friend  
  
Yours most affectionately  
B. FRANKLIN
