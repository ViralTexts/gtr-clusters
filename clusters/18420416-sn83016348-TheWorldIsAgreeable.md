**The World is Agreeable.**  
  
This is an agreeable world after all. If we would only bring ourselves to look at the objects that surround us in their true light, we should see beauty where we behold deformity, and listen to harmony where we heard nothing but discord. To be sure there is a great deal of vexation and anxiety to meet; we cannot sail up a summer coast for ever; yet, if we reserve a calm eye and steady hand, we can so trim our sail and manage our helm as to avoid quicksands and weather the storms that threaten shipwreck. We are members of one great family; we are travelling the same road, and should arrive at the same goal. We breathe the same air, are subject to the same bounty, and we shall lie down upon the bosom of our common mother. It is not becoming then that brother should hate brother—it is not proper that friend should deceive friend; it is not right that neighbor should injure neighbor. We pity that man who can harbor enmity against his fellow; be loses half the enjoyment of life—he embitters his own existence. Let us tear from our eyes the colored medium that invests every object with the green husk of jealousy and suspicion; turn a deaf ear to scandal; breathe the spirit of charily from our hearts—let the rich gushings of human kindness swell up as a fountain; so that the “golden age” will become no fiction, and the islands of the blessed, bloom in more than “Hyperion beauty.”

And youth and age, in time prepare !  
For though to-day the sun beams bright,  
To-morrow&#x27;s clouds may obscure its light ;  
And he who walks in health to-day  
To-morrow may be but senseless clay.  
There&#x27;s a spectre glides with noiseless tread ;  
This night he may stand beside your bed ;  
And many there be, now laughing loud,  
Who will ere the morrow fill a shroud.  
Noble Sentiment. —&quot;This is

only bring ourselves to look at the  
objects that surround us in their true  
light, we should see beauty where  
before we beheld deformity, and listen  
to harmony where before we could  
hear nothing but discord. To be  
sore there is a great deal of anxiety  
and vexation to meet ; we cannot ex­  
pect to sail upon a summer sea forever;  
yet if we preserve a calm eye and steady  
hand, we can so trim our sails and  
manage our helm as to avoid the quick  
sands and weather the storms that  
threaten shipwreck.  
We are members of one great fam­  
ily ; we are all traveling the same  
road, and shall arrive at the same goal  
We breathe the free air, we are sub  
ject to ths same bounty, and we shall  
lie down on the bosom of our common  
mother. It is not becoming then that  
brother should hate brother ; it is not  
right that neighbor should injure neigh  
bor. We pity that man who can harbor  
enmity against his fellow ; he loses half  
the enjoyment of life ; he embitters his  
own existence. Let us tear from our  
eyes the colored medium that invests  
every object with the green hue of  
jealousy ond suspeion ; turn a deaf

spirit of charity from our lips ; and from
