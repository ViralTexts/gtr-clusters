The World is Agreeable.**  
  
This is an agreeable world after all. If we would only bring ourselves to look at the objects that surround us in their true light, we should see beauty where we behold deformity, and listen to harmony where we heard nothing but discord. To be sure there is a great deal of vexation and anxiety to meet; we cannot sail up a summer coast for ever; yet, if we reserve a calm eye and steady hand, we can so trim our sail and manage our helm as to avoid quicksands and weather the storms that threaten shipwreck. We are members of one great family; we are travelling the same road, and should arrive at the same goal. We breathe the same air, are subject to the same bounty, and we shall lie down upon the bosom of our common mother. It is not becoming then that brother should hate brother—it is not proper that friend should deceive friend; it is not right that neighbor should injure neighbor. We pity that man who can harbor enmity against his fellow; be loses half the enjoyment of life—he embitters his own existence. Let us tear from our eyes the colored medium that invests every object with the green husk of jealousy and suspicion; turn a deaf ear to scandal; breathe the spirit of charily from our hearts—let the rich gushings of human kindness swell up as a fountain; so that the “golden age” will become no fiction, and the islands of the blessed, bloom in more than “Hyperion beauty.”

cameleon-like, take the color of every thing they  
touch ; who are so condescending as to coincide with  
They will practice vice  
  
If any thing is unpopu-  
  
sufficient ground to reject it, and talk against it. ~ Such  
persons deservedly lose the confidence of all honest  
and consistent men. For they at one time advocate  
the opinions which they oppose at another, and pro-  
fess friendship for those they are with, and then,  
when they are with others, turn against them. Such  
persons are like flood trash floating upon the surface  
of a river, and taking every new direction with the

ficient weight to sink to the bottom of the stream.

Tris WorrLp. This is an agreeable world,  
after all. It we would only bring ourselves to  
look at the objects that surround us in their true  
light, we should see beauty where before we  
could behold nothing but discord. To be sure,  
there is a great deal of anxiet{ and vexation to  
meet, we cannot expect to sail on a summer sea  
forever ; yet if we hold a calm eye and a steady .  
hand, we soon can trim our sails and manage our  
helm so as to avoid the quicksand and weather  
the storms that threaten shipwreck. We are  
members of one great family—we are travelling  
the same road—and shall arrive at the same gaol.  
We breathe the free air, we are subject to the  
same bounty, and we shall lie down on the bosom  
of our common mother. It is not becoming then,  
that brother should hate brother ; it is not proper  
that friends should hate friends; it is not right  
that neighbor shoutd deceive neighbor. We pity  
the man who can harbor enmity towards his fel­  
low ; he loses half the enjoyment of life ; he em­  
bitters his own existence. Let us tear from our  
eyes the colored medium that invests every object  
with the green hue of jealousy and suspicion;  
turn a deaf ear to the voice of scandal ; breathe  
the epirit of charity from our lips; and from our  
hearts let the rich gushings of human kindness  
swell up as from a fountain—so the ¢ Folden 13:,’

to look at the objects that surround us in their  
true light, we should see beauty where before we  
beheld deformity, and listen to harmony, where  
we before could hear nothing but discord. To be  
sure there is a great deal of anxiety to meet; we  
cannot expect to sail upon a summer sea forever;  
yet if we persevere with a calm eye and a steady  
hand, we can so trim our sails and manage our  
helm as to avoid the quicksands and weather the  
storms that threaten shipwreck. We are mem­  
bers of one great family; we are all travelling  
the same road and shall arrive at the same goal.  
We breathe the free air, we are subject to the  
same bounty and shall lie down on the bosom of  
the same common mother. Itis not becoming then  
that brother should hate brother; it is not proper  
that friend should deceive friend; it is not right  
that neighbor should injure neighbor. We pity  
that man who can harbor enmity against his  
fellow; he losses half the enjoyments of life; he  
embitters his own cxistence. Let us tear from  
our eyes the colored medium that invests every  
object with the green hue of jealousy and suspi­  
cion; turn a deat ear to the tale of scandal;  
breathe the spirit of charity from our lips; and  
from our hearts let the rich gushings of human  
kindness swell up as from a fountain, so the
