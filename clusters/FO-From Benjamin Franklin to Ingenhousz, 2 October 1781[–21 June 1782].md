I have now before me your several Favours of Dec. 5. 1780 Feb. 7. April 7. May 23. &amp; Aug. 29. 1781. I was glad to find by the first, that you enjoy’d a good State of Health, and that you had Leisure to pursue your Philosophical Enquiries. I wish you that continued Success which so much Industry, Sagacity &amp; Exactness in making Experiments, have a Right to expect. You will have much Pleasure immediate by that Success, &amp; in time great Reputation. But for the present, the Reputation will be given grudgingly &amp; in as small a Quantity as possible, mix’d too with some Mortification. One would think that a Man so labouring disinterestedly for the Good of his Fellow-Creatures, could not possibly by such means make himself Enemies; but there are Minds who cannot bear that another should distinguish himself even by greater usefulness; and tho’ he demands no Profit, nor any thing in Return but the Good Will of those he is serving, they will endeavour to deprive him of that, first by disputing the Truth of his Experiments, then their Utility, &amp; being defeated there, they finally dispute his Right to them, and would give the Credit of them to a Man that liv’d 3000 Years ago, or at 3000 Leagues distance, rather than to a Neighbour or even a Friend. Go on, however, &amp; never be discouraged. Others have met with the same Treatment before you, and will after you. And whatever some may think &amp; say, it is worth while to do Men Good, for the Self Satisfaction one has in the Reflection.

‘I have now before me your several favours of December 5, 1780,  
February 7, April 7, May 23, and August 29, 1781. I was glad to find  
by the first, that you enjoyed a good state of health, and that you had  
leisure to pursue your philosophical inquiries. I wish you that con-  
tinued success which so much industry, sagacity, and exactness in  
making experiments, have a right toexpect. You will have much im-  
mediate pleasure by that success, and in time great reputation. But  
for the present the reputation will be given grudgingly, and in as small  
a quantity as possible, rmixed too with some mortification. One would  
think that a man so labouring disinterestedly for the good of his fellow  
creatures, could not possibly by such means make himself enemies;  
but there are minds who cannet bear that another should distinguish  
himself even by greater usefulness; and though he demands no profit,  
nor any thing in return but the good-will of those he is serving, they  
will endeavour to deprive him of that, first by disputing the truth of his  
experiments, then their utility, and being defeated there, they finally  
dispute his right to them, and would give the credit of them to a man  
that lived three thousand years ago, or at three thousand leagues dis-  
tance, rather than to a neighbour or even a friend. Go on,, however,  
and never be discouraged. Others have met with the same treatment  
before you, and will after you. And whatever some may think and  
say, it is worth while to do men good, for the seli-satisfaction one has  
in the reflection.’
