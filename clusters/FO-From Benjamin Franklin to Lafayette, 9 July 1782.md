ge for it. On July 9, Grenville wrote Shelburne that Franklin “the other day, for the first time, gave me to understand that America must be to have her share in the N: Foundland Fishery, &amp; that the limits of Canada would likewise be a subject for arrangement. He seems much dis-inclined to an idea he expects to be stated, of going into an examination, for the mutual compensation of the losses of individuals, insisting, perhaps with reason, upon the endless detail that would be produced by it; nor does he cease to give the most decided discouragement to any possible plan of arrangement with America, short of compleat and distinct independance, in it’s fullest sense.”  
Franklin went into greater detail in a two-hour meeting w

“… He took out a minute, &amp; from it read a few hints or articles. Some he said as necessary for them to insist on; others which he could not say he had any Orders about, or were not absolutely demanded, &amp; yet such as it would be advisable for England to offer for the sake of Reconciliation, and her future Interest, Viz:  
1st. Of the first Class, necessary to be granted. Independence full &amp; complete in every sense to the 13 States &amp; all Troops to be withdrawn from thence.  
2d. A settlement of the boundaries of their Colonies, &amp; the loyal Colonies.  
3d. A Confinement of the Boundaries of Canada, at least to what they were, before the last Act of Parliament, I think in 1774, if not to a still more contracted State, on an ancient footing.  
4. A freedom of fishing on the Banks of Newfoundland, &amp; elsewhere, as well for Fish as whales. I own I wonder’d he should have thought it necessary to ask for this priviledge. He did not mention the Leave of drying Fish on shore in Newfoundland, &amp; I said nothing of it. I dont remember any more articles which he said they would insist on, or what he calld necessary for them to be granted.  
Then as to the adviseable Articles, or such as he would as a Friend recommend to be offer’d by England Viz.  
1st. To indemnify many People who had been ruind by Towns burnt &amp; destroy’d. The whole might not exceed the Sum of Five or Six hundred thousand pounds. I was struck at this. However the Dr. said though it was a large Sum, it would not be ill bestow’d; as it would conciliate the Resentment of a multitude of poor Sufferers, who could have no other Remedy, &amp; who without some Relief, would keep up a Spirit of secret Revenge &amp; Animosity for a long time to come, against Great Britain: whereas a voluntary Offer of such Reparation, would diffuse an universal Calm &amp; Conciliation over the whole Country.  
2d. Some Sort of Acknowledgment in some public Act, of Parliament or otherwise, of our Error in distressing those countries so much as We had done. A few words of that kind the Dr said, would do more good than People could imagine.  
3d. Colony Ships &amp; Trade to be receiv’d &amp; have the same priviledges in Britain &amp; Ireland, as British ships &amp; Trade. I did not ask any Explanation on that head for the present. British &amp; Irish Ships in the Colonies to be in like manner on the same footing with their own ships.  
4. Giving up every part of Canada
