of the Public Advertiser.  
Sir,  
Your anonymous Correspondent in last Tuesday’s Paper calls it Arrogance to place the Subjects in America and the Subjects in Great Britain upon a Level; and to prove it, asks and answers “from whom do the People of Great Britain hold their Lands? From no People under Heaven. From whom do most of the Inhabitants in North America hold their Lands? Not from Themselves, but from Great Britain. Does one Foot of Land on the Banks of the Missisippi belong to the American Colonists? No, the Lands on the Eastern Bank of the Mississippi, for the Extent of 1000 Miles, are the Property of the People of Great Britain, or of the King, as Trustee for the People of Great Britain.” Thus far your positive Correspondent. To me, however it seems, that the Subjects in the two Countries are more upon a Level than he imagines. Britain was formerly the America of the Germans. They came hither in their Ships; found the Cream of the Land possessed by a Parcel of Welsh Caribbs, whom they judged unworthy of it, and therefore drove them into the Mountains, and sat down in their Places. These Anglo-Saxons, our Ancestors, came at their own Expence, and therefore supposed that when they had secured the new Country, they held it of themselves, and of no other People under Heaven. Accordingly we do not find that their Mother Country, Germany, ever pretended to tax them; nor is it likely, if she had, that they would have paid it. So far then the Level is clear; for unless Great Britain had a Property in the Lands of America before the Colonists went thither, it does not appear how they could take Lands of her to hold on any Terms. Now the Fact is well known, that Britain had not a Foot of Land in New-England; and that when the first Settlers went into that Country, they found it possessed by various Tribes of Indians, from whom they either purchased or conquered what they now enjoy. European Nations have indeed pretended, some, that the Pope could give them a Right to the Lands of America; others, that, sailing along a Coast there, landing on some Beach unseen by the Natives, and branding a Post with the Arms of their own Country, created a Right to as much of the internal Territory as they should afterwards think proper to claim. But “one would hardly imagine” as your Writer says, “that such Nonsense could find Advocates.” And yet he himself tells us, “the Lands on the Eastern Bank of the Mississippi are the Property of the People of Great Britain.” That is, the French claimed them because one of their Nation discovered them by sailing down that River in a Canoe, and at the End of the last War gave up that Claim to the English. Whatever Right this Conquest conferred, give me Leave to say, is as much a Right of the Colonies as of Great Britain; for they had Man for Man with her in the Armies that fought for it.  
But if Englishmen should come with this Parchment Right in their Hands, and bid an Indian Nation, settled there, remove in Consequence of it, I believe they would say, what your Correspondent says on the other Side of the Question, “that it is directly contrary to the Nature of Things and to Common-sense.” Thus, Cassini, the French Astronomer, discovered with his Telescope that District in the Moon, which, in Honour of his Sovereign, he called Louisiana. By a successful War, perhaps, we might oblige Louis to give it up, and agree that it should henceforth, in all Maps of the Moon be called Nova Britannia, and be held by King George as Trustee for the People of Great Britain. But if Englishmen could fly as well as sail, and arriving there should claim the Country upon that Right, the native Inhabitants, to acknowledge and submit to it must be Lunatics indeed.  
In Fact, neither the Grantor nor the Grantees of these chimerical Rights, ever understood more by them than that they were an Exclusion of other Englishmen from the respective Boundaries of each Grant. The Grantees, to obtain some Title, were obliged to purchase of the Indians, or conquer them at their own Charges. And if they had insisted that the Crown should put them in Possession of what it granted, the Grant would probably never have been made. This Purchase and Conquest, with the Expence of settling and clearing the Lands, have occasioned many of the Grants to be relinquished, as not worth holding. And most of those who went thro’ with their Undertakings find they have dearly earned or paid for what they now possess. And yet, notwithstanding what this Writer says, I believe he cannot produce an Instance since the Settlement of the Country, of any one Colonist’s Refusal to pay the stipulated Quit-rent to the Crown, on any Pretence whatever. His Accusation, therefore, in this Point is injurious and quite without Foundation.  
Since a good Understanding between the Parts of a great Empire is the Strength of the Whole, what beneficial End can it a

swer to represent the Colonists here as unreasonable and unjust, if they object to a Compliance with Exactions they think unconstitutional? Perpetual Abuse and false Representation, may exasperate and alienate on both Sides. It may divide. It can never unite. This Writer says, “The Colonists will most graciously accept of Land from Great Britain for nothing; but should Great Britain ask for a small Part of the Produce of those Lands to help to defray the Public Expence, the Colonist immediately cries out he is treated as a Slave, and robbed of his Property.” Now it happens that Facts shew this Charge also to be groundless; and that the Writer does not, in his own Phrase, use “the Words of Truth and Soberness.” The Grant of Lands for nothing, I have already spoken to; and I here add, that Great Britain never asked for a small or any Part of the Produce of those Lands to help defray the Public Expence, but it was immediately, voluntarily and freely given, in Proportion to the Abilities of the People. But there is some Difference between asking and taking by Force. The old Way, and the best, in my humble Opinion, was for the Crown to ask Supplies, and then they were granted to an Extent beyond its Expectations. The new Way is to make an Act of Parliament to levy Duties on the Colonies without asking, and send a Fleet and Army to enforce it. A Landlord engaged in an expensive Law-suit may borrow Money of his Tenants who respect him, or by shewing them that their Interest in the Event is the same with his, he may receive their voluntary Contributions towards the Support of his Litigation; but if he should declare that he has a Right to take from them whatever he thinks proper, and should go from House to House among them with a Parcel of armed Servants, extorting Money Sword in Hand, perhaps it might be justly called Robbery; at least it would be manifest that the Want of Money was not his only Want—that he wanted Honesty—and it would be found in the End that he also wanted Understanding.  
As a Friend to both Countries, being connected with both, I wish Governor Hutchinson had thought of some other Subject for his Speech, and not revived needlessly a Dispute that can end in nothing but Mischief. I am sure he could not expect to convince an Individual there by such known false Facts and sophistical Reasoning. Here the Discourse appears plausible by chiming in with national and ministerial Prejudices, and therefore I think it written to recommend himself here, and not to do Service there. It has been industriously printed and circulated here before the Assembly’s Answer could come over. To that however I leave it, only reminding its Readers of the equitable Rule, Audi et alteram partem.  
The hacknied Argument of your Correspondent, that all the Freeholders in America ought to be taxed by Parliament, though they have no Share in the Choice of its Members, because many People in England are so taxed without having any Share in that Choice, seems to be arguing from bad to worse. If any here are unjustly deprived of that Privilege, restore it. Do right at home, if you please, and then make that a Precedent for doing right abroad: But never think that doing wrong at home will justify your doing wrong all the World over. The Argument is a Confession indeed, but contains not the least Shadow of a Justification. I am, Sir,   
A New England-ma

From the Public Advertiser.  
Ta the PRINTER.  
XZOUR anonymous correspondent in  
last Tuefeay’s paper calls it arrogantc  
to place the fubjeds in America and the  
lubjeds in Great Britain upon a level ; and  
to prove it, asks and answers, * from whom  
‘ do the people of Great-Britain hold their  
* lands ? From no people under Heaven  
• From whom do most of the inhabitants  
• in North-America hold their lands ? Not  
• from themselves, but from G eat­  
* Britain. Does one foot of land on the  
* banks of the Miflifippi belong to the A­  
* merican colonists I No, the lands on the  
* eastern bank of the Miffifipp:, for the  
( rxtent ot one thousand miles, are the  
‘ Property of the people of Great-Bri*  
* tain, or of the Ring, as trustee for the  
• people of Great-Britain.’ Thus far  
vour pofnive correspondent. To me, how­  
ever, it fee ms, that the fubjr&amp;s in the two  
countries are more upon a level than hr  
imagines. Britain was so merly the Ame­  
.icaofthe Germans. They came hither  
m their Ihips; found the cream of the land  
□off IT d by a parcel of We&#x27;ch Caribba.  
•vhom they judged unworthy of it, and  
:herefore drove them into the mountains,  
md Gt down in their placet. T hele An­  
jo Saxons, cur ancestors, came at their  
wn and therefore foppofei, that  
when they had Iccured the new country  
  
they held it cf themselves, and of no other  
people under Heaven. Accordingly we do  
not find that their mother country, Ger­  
many, ever pretended to tax them ; nor is  
it likely, if (he had, that they would have  
paid it. So far then the level is clear ; for  
unless Great-Britain had a property in the  
lands of America, before the colonists went  
thither, it does not appear how they could  
take lands of her to hold on any terms.  
Now the fad is well known, that Britain  
had not a foot of land in New-England ;  
and that when the firft settlers went into  
that country, they found it poflefled by va*  
rious tribes of Indians, from whom they  
purchafed or conquered what they  
now enjoy. European nations have in*  
deed pretended, some, that the Pope could  
give them a right to the lands of America ।  
others, that failing along the coast there,  
landing on some beach unseen by the na­  
tives, and branding a post with the arms of  
their own country, created a right to as  
much of the internal teritory as thci should  
afterwards think proper to claim. But * one  
• would hardly imagine,’ as your Writer fays,  
‘ thatfuch nonsense could find advocates?  
And yet he himfelf tells us, • the lands on  
* the eastern bank of the Miflifippi are the  
* property of the people of Grgat-Britain.*  
That is the French ci aimed them, because  
one of their nation difeovered them by fail­  
ing down that river in a canoe, and at the  
end of the last war gave up that claim to  
the Englilh. Whatever right this con­  
quest conferred, give me leave to fay, is as  
much a right of the colonies as of Great-  
Britain ; for they had man for man with  
her in the armies that fought /or it.  
But if Englilhmen should come with  
this parchment right in their hands, and  
bid an Indian nation fettled there, remove  
in confequeDce of it, 1 believe they would  
fay, what your correspondent fays on the  
other fide of the question, * that it is di­  
* reAly contrary to the nature of things,  
* and to common fenfe.’ Thus Caffini the  
French Astronomer difeovered with h»  
tclcfcope that diftriA in the moon, which,  
in honour of his lovereign, he called Lent*  
fiana. By a fuccefsful war, perhaps, we  
might oblige Lottu to give it up, and a­  
gree that it should henceforth, in all maps  
of the moon be called Neva Britania, and  
be held by King George as trustee for the  
people ot Great-Britain. But if English­  
men could fiy as well as and arriving  
there fhowa claim the country upon that  
right, the native inhabitants, to acknow.  
ledge end fabmit to it, must be Lunaticx  
indeed. •  
In fad, neither the grantor nor grantees  
of theft chimerical rights, ever uaderftood  
more by them than that they were an ex­  
clusion of other Enghfhmen from the re­  
fpedive boundaries of each grant. The  
Grantees to obtain some title, were oblig­  
ed to purctufe of the Indians, or conquer  
them at their own chargee. And if they  
had infitted that the crown should put  
them in pofleflion of what was granted, the  
grant would probably never have been  
made. This purchase and conqurft, with  
the expence of fettling and clearing the  
lands, have occasioned many of the grants  
to be relinquished, as not worth holding.  
And most of tXofe who went through with  
their undertakings, find they have dearly  
earned or paid for what they now poflefs.  
And yet notwitbftanding what this wiiter  
fays, I believe he cannot produce an in­  
ttance since the settlement qf the country,  
at any one colorift&#x27;s (o pay the fti­  
pu ated quit-rent to the,crown, on any  
pretence whatever. His rtcufation, there­  
to c, in this point is injurious and quite  
without foundation.  
Since a good undfrftHding between the  
pans of a great rmpi.e, is the strength of  
the who&#x27;e, what beneficial er.d can it an

ter does not, in his own phrase, yfe the

ipoken to ; and I here asd, that Great-Bri­  
tain never ajked for a fmaii or any part of  
the produce of thole lands to help to defray  
the public expence, but it was immediate­  
ly, voluntarily and free’y given, in propor­  
tion to the abilities of the people. But  
there is some difference between ajking and  
taking by forct —The old W/i ana the beP,  
in my humble opinion, was for the crown  
to ojk fuppbes, and then they were grant­  
ed to an extent beyond its expectations.  
The new way is to make an ad of par&#x27;ia­

has aright to take from them whatever bo  
thinks proper, and (hould go from house tc  
house among them with a parcel of armed  
servants, extorting money (word in hand,  
perhaps it might be justly called robbery,  
at lead it would be manifeft that the want  
of money was not his only want—that he  
wanted honefty*—and it would be found in  
the end that he alio wanted undemanding.  
As a friend to both countries, being

Hutchinson had thought of Tome other fub­

leftly a dispute that can end in nothing

ped to convince an individual there by  
such known falfe fads and sophistical rea­  
soning. Here the discourse appears plausi­  
ble, by chimtingrn with national and mi­  
nisterial prejudices, and therefore I think  
it written to recommend himfelf here, and  
nyt to do fervicc there. It has been induf­  
tr.oufly printed and circulated here before

they have no ihare in the choice of it:

are so taxed withouthaving any Ihare in that
