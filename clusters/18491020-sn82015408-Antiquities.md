THE ORIGIN OF MANKIND.  
FOR THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER.  
A Catawba Legend.  
There was a time when the world was an unbroken waste  
i  
i  
of rocks, hills, and mountains,  
save only one small valley,  
which was distinguished for its luxuriance, and where reigned  
a perpetual summer.  
At that time, too, the only human be­  
ing who inhabited the earth was a woman, whose knowledge  
was confined to this valley, and who is remembered among  
the Catawbas as the mother of mankind.  
She lived in a ca­  
vern, and her food consisted of the honey of flowers and the  
sweet berries and other fruits of the wilderness.  
Birds with­  
out number, and the wild streams which found a resting place  
in the valley, made the only music which she ever heard  
Among the wild animals, which were very numerous about  
her home, she wandered without any danger; but the beaver  
and the doe were her favorite companions.  
In personal ap­  
pearance she was eminently beautiful, and the lapse of years  
only had a tendency to increase the brightness of her eyesand  
the grace of her movements.  
The dress she wore was made  
of those bright green leaves which enfold the water lilies, and  
her hair was as long as the grass which fringed the waters of  
her native vale.  
She was the ruling spirit of a perennial  
world, for even the very flowers which bloomed about her syl­  
van home were never known to wither or die. In spite of her  
lonely condition, she knew not what it was to be lonely ; but  
ever and anon a strange desire found its way to her heart,  
which impelled her to explore the wild country which sur­  
rounded her home. For many days had she resisted the temp­  
tation to become a wanderer from her charming valley, until  
it so happened, on a certain morning, that a scarlet butterfly  
made its appearance before the door of her cave, and by the  
hum of its wings invited her away.  
She obeyed the sum­  
mons, and followed the butterfly far up a rocky ravine, until  
she came to the foot of a huge waterfall, when she was de­  
serted by her mysterious pilot, and first became acquainted  
with the emotion of fear. Her passage of the ravine had been  
comparatively smooth, but when she endeavored, in her con­  
sternation, to retrace her steps, she found her etrts unavail­  
ing, and fell to the ground in despair. A deep sleep then over­  
came her senses, from which she was not awakened until the  
night was far spent , and then the dampness of the dew had  
fallen upon her soft limbs, and for the first time in her life did  
she feel the pang of a bodily pain.  
Forlorn and desolate in­  
deed was her condition, and she felt that some great event  
was about to happen, when, as she uncovered her face and  
turned it to the sky, she beheld, bending over her prostrate  
form, and clothed in a cloud-like robe, the image of a being  
somewhat resembling herself, only that he was more stoutly  
made, and of a much fiercer aspect. Hefrt cmctionat his  
Her first emotion at this  
strange discovery was that of terror; but, as the mysterious  
being looked upon her in kindness, and raised her lovingly  
from the ground, she confided in his protection, and listened  
to his words until the break of day.  
He told her that he was a native of the far off sky, and that  
he had discovered her in her forlorn condition while travelling  
from the evening to the morning star. He told her also that  
he had never before seen a being so soft and beautifully-form­  
ed as she. In coming to her rescue he had broken a command i  
of the (treat Spirit, or the Master of Life, and, as he was afraid &#x27;  
to return to the sky, he desired to spend his days in her so- I  
ciety upon earth. With joy did she accept this proposal; and, i  
as the sun rose above the distant mountains, the twain return­  
ed in safety to the luxuriant vale, where, as man and woman,  
for many moons, they lived and loved in perfect tranquillity  
and joy.  
In process of time the woman became a mother, from which  
lime the happiness of the twain became more intense, but they  
at the same time endured more troubles than they had ever  
known before.  
The man was unhappy because he had of­  
fended the Master of Lite, and the mother was anxious about  
the comfort and happiness of her newly-born child. Many  
and devout were the prayers they offered to the Great Spirit  
for his guidance and protection, for they felt that from them  
were to be descended a race of beings more numerous than  
the stars of heaven. The Great Spirit had compassion on i  
these lone inhabitants of the earth, and in answer to their |  
prayers he caused a mighty wind to pass over the world, ma- i  
kiug the mountains crowd closely together, and rendering the  
world more useful and beautiful by the prairies and valleys and  
rivers which now cover it, from the rising to the setting sun.  
The Master of Life also told his children that he would give  
them the earth and all that it contained as their inheritance ;  
but that they should never enjoy their food without labor,  
should be annually exposed to a season of bitter cold, and !  
that their existence should be limited by that period of time |  
when their’heads should become as white as the plumage of .  
the swan.  
And soendeth the words of the Catawba.

being looked upon her in kindness, and raised her lovingly  
from the ground, she confided in his protection, and listened  
to his words until the break of day.  
He told her that he was a native of the far off sky, and that  
he had discovered her in her forlorn condition while travelling  
from ihe evening to the morning star. He told her also that  
he had never before seen a being so soft and beautifully-form­  
ed as she. In coming to her rescue he had broken a command  
of the Great Spirit, or the Master of Life, and, as he was airaid  
to return to the sky, he desired to spend his days in her sar  
ciety upon earth. V\ ith joy did she accept this proposal; and,  
as the sun rose above the distant mountains, the twain return­  
ed in safety to the luxuriant vale, where, as man and woman,  
fir many moons, they lived and loved in perfect tranquillity  
and joy.  
in process of lime the woman liecame a mother, from which  
time the happiness of the twain became more intense, b-jt they  
fjt the same time endured more troubles than they had ever  
known before. The man was unhappy because he had of  
(ended the Master of Lite, and the mother was anxious about  
the comfort and happiness of her newly-born child. Many  
tnd devout were the prayers they offered to the Great spirit  
for his guidance and protection, for they felt that from them  
were to be descended a race of beings more numerous than  
toe stars of heaven. The Great Spirit had compassion on  
these lone inhabitants of the earth, and in answer to their  
j&gt;r&amp;yers he caused a mighty wind to pass over the world, ma­  
Ling the mountains crowd closely together, and rendering the  
world more useful and l&gt;eautilul by the prairies and valleys and  
rivers which now cover it, frcm the rising to the setting sun.  
IV Master of Life also told his children that he would give  
them the earth and all that it contained as their inheritance ;  
but that they should never enjoy their lood without labor,  
should lie annually exposed to a season of bitter cold, and  
that their existence should lie limited by that period of time  
when their heads should become as white as the plumage of  
the swan. And soendeth the words of the Catawba.

of tho aban  
doned.  
From the National Intelligencer.  
Origin of Mankind.  
A CATAWBA LIUr.ND.  
There was a time when ilia world wa an  
uubrokeii waste of rocks, hills, mount, mis.  
save only one small valley, which was dis-  
linguihed lor us luxuriauce, ami wlieiercign--ed  
a perpetual summer. At that iimev too.  
til ooly humu beiug who&#x27; inhabited the  
earth was a womuu, whoso knowledge was  
coufned to this valicv, an. J who is tcuietn-  
beted auiui:; the C.UJ&#x27;vb.is h the mother of  
mankind. Mie lived in a cavern, and iter  
food consisted of the honey of ilotvci and  
thestteet berries and other fruits of the wil­  
derness. Uirds without number, and the  
&quot;wild slieauis which found a resting place in  
he valley, nude tho only iiuiiick which she  
ever beat J. Among the wild animal which  
were very numerous about her home, she  
waudcied without any danger; but the bea­  
ver aod the doe were her fiVuriie companions  
In personal appearance she was eminently  
beautiful, anJ the lapse ol years ouly had a  
tendency to increase the brightness of her  
eyes and the grace ol her movements. The  
dies she wore was made of those blight  
green leaves which enfold the water lilies,  
and her hair was as Ion;; as tho grass which  
fiiuged the waif rs of her native vale. i$Uv  
was the ruling .spirit of a perreuuial woild,  
lor even the very (lowers whi:h bloomed abou  
her sjlvan homo weie never kuuwu to wiilic  
or die.  
Iusite of licr lonely condition, she knew  
not what it was to be loutl;.; but ever and  
anou a strange desire fouu.i its way to her!  
he ut, which impelled her toexplore the wild  
country hi&#x27;;h surrounded ht r home. For  
many days ha 1 she resisted the temptation  
to become a wanderer horn her charming:  
valley, unti it so hapened o&#x27;i a ccitaiu mor­  
ning, that a scarlet bultt rlly made its appear­  
ance, belore the door of hei cave, and bv the  
hum of its wings invited her away. She  
obeyed the summons, aud followed the but­  
teilly far up a rocky ravine, until she came  
lo t lie fool of a huge wateifall, wheu she was  
deserted by Iter rnysterous pilot, and fust  
became acquainted with the emotion of lear.  
llei passage of the ravine had been compar­  
atively smooth, but when she eudeavorered  
in her eofisteriution, to u lraceher footsteps,  
she found her elicits unavaihug, and tell to  
the giound in despair. A deep sleep then  
overcame her senses, from which she was not  
awakened until the night was far spent; aud  
then the dampness ol the dew had fallen on  
her soft limbs, and (or the Ihst time iu her  
life did she feel the pang of a bodily pain.  
Foilofii and desolate iuJetd w.i her condi­  
tion, and die felt that some great event was  
about to happen, w hen, as she uncovered her  
face and turned it to the sky, she beheld  
bending over her prostrate fuim, and clothed  
in a cloud-like robe, the image of a being  
somewhat leseiuUing heiaelf, only that he  
was more Btoutly made, and of a much liei­  
cer aspect. I let first emotion ut this strange  
discovery was that of terroi; but as the mys­  
terious being looked upon her iti kindness  
and raised her loveingly from the ground,  
she coufilad in his protection, and listened to  
his words uulil the break of day.  
He told her that he was a native of the far  
oil&#x27; sky. aod that he had discovered her in her  
forlorn condition while travelling fiom the  
evening lo the morning star, lie told her  
also that he had never seen before a being so  
soft aud beautifully formed as she. in com­  
ing lo her rescue he had broken a command  
of the Great .Spirit, or tho master of Life, and,  
as lie was alnn 1 to returu to the sky, he de­  
sired lo spend his days in her society upon  
earth. With joy did she accept this pros­  
perity; and as the sun rose abovo the distant  
mountains, thctwairi returned in safety to the  
luxuriant vale, where, as man and woman,  
for many moons, they lived and loved iu  
perfect tranquility and joy.  
In pioccss oftimc the woman became a  
mother, from which time the happiness of  
the twain became moic intense, but they at  
the same time endured more troubles than  
they had ever known before. Tho man was  
unhappy because he had offended the Master  
of Life, and the mother was anxious about  
the romfort and happiness of her new-born  
child.&#x27; Many and devout wcro the prayers  
they olTered&#x27;to the Grct Spirit for his guid­  
ance and protection, for they felt that from  
them were to be decended a race of beings  
more numerous than tho stars of heaven.  
Th Great Spirit had compassion on these  
lone inhabitants of the earth, and in answer  
to their prayers be caused a mighty wind to  
pass ovefihe world, nuking the mountains  
crowd closely together, aoJ rendering iho  
world more useful and beautiful by piairics  
and valleys and livers which now cover it,  
from the rising to the setting sun. The  
Master of life also told hi children that he  
would give them the earth aod all that it con­  
tained, as their inheritance, but that they  
should never enjoy their food without labor,  
should be annally exposed to a season of bit­  
ter cold, and tljat their exigence should be  
  
limited by that period of time when their  
heads should become as white as the plum­  
age ol the swan. And so enJctli tho words  
ot tho Catawba.

Tue Moprerns may boast of their extraordinary  
achievements and discoveries, but what are they to  
compare with the works of the ancients. Ninevah  
was fifteen miles long, and forty round, with walls  
one hundred feet high: and thick enough for three  
chariots. Babylon was sixty miles within the walls,  
which were seventy-five feet thick, and three hundred  
high, with one hundred and sixty brazen gates. The  
temple of Diana at Ephesus was four hundred and  
twenty feet high. The largest of the pyramids is  
four hundred and eighty-one feet high, and seven  
hundred and ninety-three on the sides, its base covers  
thirteen acres. The stones are about thirty feet in  
length, and the layers are two hundred and six; one  
hundred thousand mén were employed in its erection.  
About the fifteen hundred and ninetieth part of the  
Great Pyramid of Egypt is occupied by chambers  
and passages; all the rest is solid masonry. The  
Labyrinth of Egypt contains three thousand cham-  
bers and twelve halls. Thebes, in Egypt, presents  
ruins twenty seven miles round. It has one hundred  
gates. Carthage was twenty-five miles round. Athens  
was twenty-five miles round, and contained twenty-  
five thousand citizens and four hundred thousand  
slaves. The temple of Delphos was so rich in do-  
nations, that is was once plundered of £100,000,000,  
sterling: and Nero carried from it five hundred sta-  
tues. The walls of Rome were thirteen miles in ex-  
tent, and four hundred and eighty feet in height.  
In literature and art they surpassed us still more.  
Their works serve as our models, and

and four hundred feet high, with one hundred  
brazen gates. The temple of Diana, at Ephe­  
sus, was four hundred and twenty feet to the  
support of the roof. It was a hundred vears  
in building. The largest of the pyramids is  
four hundred and eighty one feet high, and six  
hundred and fifty-three on the sides; its base  
covers eleven actes. The stones are about  
thirty feet in length, and the layers are three

Thebes, in Egypt, presents ruins twenty-seven  
miles round. Athens was twenty-five miles  
round and contained three hundred and fifty  
thousand citizens, and four hundred thousand  
slaves. The temple of Delphos was so rich in  
donations that it was plundred of five hundred  
thousand dollars, and Nero carried away from  
it two hundred statues. The walls of Rome  
were thirteen miles round.  
On Thursday afternoon last, a gentleman  
walked into an Insurance office on Walnu t  
street, Philadelphia, and asked to see the Sec  
retary. Upon that person making himself  
known, the stranger said, &quot;Sir, you are a scoun­  
drel; you have insulted my wife, and I am go  
ing to whip you.&quot; He thereupon seized the  
Secretary by the hair and struck him several  
violent blows in the face before the others  
in the office could interfere.
