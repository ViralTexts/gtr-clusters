compare with the works of the ancients. Ninevah  
was fifteen miles long, and forty round, with walls  
one hundred feet high: and thick enough for three  
chariots. Babylon was sixty miles within the walls,  
which were seventy-five feet thick, and three hundred

About the fifteen hundred and ninetieth part of the

le for  
beautifying the complexion,&#x27; said Mrs.  
Bibb, holding up a small bottle for Mrs,  
Partington to examine. She looked up  
from darning a woollen sock for Ike, and  
took the bottle in her hand. &#x27;Is it,  
indeed?&#x27; said she, &#x27; Well, they may get  
up ever so many rostrums for beautifying  
the complexion, but, depend upon it, the  
less people have to do with bottles for  
it the better. My neighbour Mrs. Blotch  
has been using a bottle for a good many  
years for her complexion, and her nose  
looks like a ruption of Mount  
Vociferous, with the burning lather  
running ail over the contagious  
territory.&#x27; Ancient Antiquities —  
Nineveh was 15 miles long and 40 round,  
with walls 100 feet ^ high, thick enough  
for three chariots. Babylon was 60 miles  
within the walls, which were 75 feet  
thick, and 300 high, with 100 brazen  
gates. The temple of Diana, at Ephesus,  
was 425 feet high, it was 200 years in  
building. The largest of the pyramids is  
418 feet high, and 736 feet on the sides  
; its base covers 13 acres. The stones  
are about 30 feet in length, and the  
layers are 201 ; 100,000 men were  
employed in its erection. About the  
1590th part of the Great Pyramid of  
Egypt is occupied by chambers and  
passages ; all the rest is solid  
masonry. The labyrinth of Egypt contains  
300 chambers and 12 halls. Thebes, in  
Egypt, presents ruins 27 miles round ;  
it has 100 gates. Carthage was 25 miles  
round. Athens was 25 miles round, and  
contained 25,000 citizens, and 400,000  
slaves. The temple of Delphos was so  
rich in donations, that it was once  
plundered of £L0,000 sterling? and Nero  
carried from it 500 statues. The walls  
of Rome were 13 miles in extent.
