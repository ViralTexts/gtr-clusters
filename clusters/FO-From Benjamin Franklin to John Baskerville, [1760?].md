Let me give you a pleasant Instance of the Prejudice some have entertained against your Work. Soon after I returned, discoursing with a Gentleman concerning the Artists of Birmingham, he said you would be a Means of blinding all the Readers in the Nation, for the Strokes of your Letters being too thin and narrow, hurt the Eye, and he could never read a Line of them without Pain. I thought, said I, you were going to complain of the Gloss on the Paper, some object to: No, no, says he, I have heard that mentioned, but it is not that; ’tis in the Form and Cut of the Letters themselves; they have not that natural and easy Proportion between the Height and Thickness of the Stroke, which makes the common Printing so much more comfortable to the Eye. You see this Gentleman was a Connoisseur. In vain I endeavoured to support your Character against the Charge; he knew what he felt, he could see the Reason of it, and several other Gentlemen among his Friends had made the same Observation, &amp;c. Yesterday he called to visit me, when, mischievously bent to try his Judgment, I stept into my Closet, tore off the Top of Mr. Caslon’s Specimen, and produced it to him as yours brought with me from Birmingham, saying, I had been examining it since he spoke to me, and could not for my Life perceive the Disproportion he mentioned, desiring him to point it out to me. He readily undertook it, and went over the several Founts, shewing me every-where what he thought Instances of that Disproportion; and declared, that he could not then read the Specimen without feeling very strongly the Pain he had mentioned to me. I spared him that Time the Confusion of being told, that these were the Types he had been reading all his Life with so much Ease to his Eyes; the Types his adored Newton is printed with, on which he has pored not a little; nay, the very Types his own Book is printed with, for he is himself an Author; and yet never discovered this painful Disproportion in them, till he thought they were yours.  
I am, &amp;c.

When a critic told Franklin that the foun-  
der’s letters “ would be the means of blinding  
all the readers in the nation,” Franklin en-  
deavored, without success, to “support your  
character against the charge” by argument.  
Not sueceeding in this, when the fault-finder  
again called upon me,  
  
Mischievously bent to try his judgment, I  
stepped into my closet, tore off the top of Mr.  
Caslon’s specimen, and produced it to him as yours,  
brought with me from Birmingham, saying, I had  
been examining it, since he spoke to me, and could  
not for my Ife perceive the disproportion he men-  
tioned, desiring him to point it out to me. He  
readily undertook it, and went over the several  
fonts, showing me everywhere what he thought  
instances of that disproportion, and declared that  
he could not then read the specimen without feel-  
ing very strongly the pain he had mentioned to  
me. I spared him that time the confusion of being  
told that these were the types he had been read-  
ing all his life with so much ease to his eyes, the  
types his adored Newton is printed with, on which  
he has pored nota little; nay, the very types his.own  
book is printed with (for he is himself an author),  
and yet never discovered this painful disproportion  
in them, till he thought they were yours.
