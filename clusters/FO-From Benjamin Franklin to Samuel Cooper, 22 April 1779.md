e Letter by the Marquis de la Fayette; and another by Mr. Bradford. I can now only write a few Words in Answer to the latter, the former not being at Hand.— The Depreciation of our Money must, as you observe, greatly affect Salary Men, Widows &amp; Orphans. Methinks this Evil deserves the Attention of the several Legislatures and ought if possible to be remedied by some equitable Law, particularly adapted to their Circumstances. I took all the Pains I could in Congress to prevent the Depreciation by proposing first that the Bills should bear Interest; this was rejected, and they were struck as you see them. Secondly, after the first Emission, I proposed that we should stop, strike no more, but borrow on Interest those we had issued. This was not then approved of and more Bills were issued.— W

eat to be stopt by a Power that might at first have been sufficient to prevent the Beginning of the Motion. The only Remedy now seems to be a Diminution of the Quantity by a vigorous Taxation, of great nominal Sums, which the People are more able to pay in Proportion to the Quantity &amp; diminished Value; and the only Consolation under the Evil is that the Publick Debt is proportionably diminish’d; with the Depreciation; —and this by a Kind of imperceptible Tax, every one having paid a Part of it in the Fall of Value that took Place between his Receiving and Paying such Sums as pass’d thro’ his Hands. For it should always be remembered that the original Intention was to sink the Bills by Taxes, which as effectually extinguish the Debt as an actual Redemption.— This Effect of Paper Currency is not understood on this Side of the Water.— And indeed the whole is a Mistery even to the Politicians; how we have been able to continue a War four years without Money; &amp; how we could pay with Paper that had no previously fix’d fund appropriated specifically to redeem it.— This Currency as we manage it is a wonderful Machine.

At the breaking out of the war, the Continental Congress com-  
menced the issue of bills of credit, and the war was carried on with-  
out other resources for three or four years. It may be said with  
truth, that we owe our national independence to the use of this fiscal  
agency. Dr. FRANKLIN, in a letter to a friend, dated from Paris in  
April, 1779, after deploring the depreciation which the Continental  
Currency had undergone, said : “ The only consolation under the evil  
is, that the public debt is proportionally diminished by the deprecia-  
tion; and this by a kind of imperceptible tax, every one having paid  
a part of it in the fall of value that took place between the receiving  
and paying such sums as passed through his hands.” He adds:  
“This effect of paper currency is not understood this side of the  
water. And, indeed, the whole is a mystery even to the politicians,  
how we have been able to continue a war four years without money,  
and how we could pay with paper, that had no previously fixed fund  
appropriated specially to redeem it. This currency, as we manage it,  
is a wonderful machine. It performs its office when we issue it ; it  
pays and clothes troops, and provides victuals and ammunition.”
