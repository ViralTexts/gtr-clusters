]  
Your anonymous correspondent, (See Vol. xxxvii. p. 620.) has declaimed on a subject, which by an unhappy combination of ignorance and obstinacy has become very like a bone of contention between the young and the old provinces of this great commonwealth.  
It seldom happens in disputes of any kind but that one side or the other lay the foundations of their arguments on error; it happens more particularly so with your angry correspondent, for whose information I will beg leave to give a short sketch of the British constitution.  
The British state or empire consists of several islands and other distant countries, asunder in different parts of the globe, but all united in allegiance to one Prince, and to the common law (Scotland excepted) as it existed in the old provinces or mother country, before the colonies or new provinces were formed. The prince, with a select parliament, or assembly, make the legislative power of and for each province within itself. Where vicinity made it convenient, several islands and provinces were at sundry times consolidated, and represented by one parliament, as the Isle of Wight, Cornwall, Wales, Cheshire, Durham, and Scotland; by which means all Great Britain and its contiguous isles, are unitedly represented in one assembly in parliament. It has not as yet been thought proper to unite Ireland to the old provinces, though lying very near; nor any of the provinces of America, which lie at a great distance. But notwithstanding this state of separate assemblies, the allegiance of the distant provinces to the crown will remain for ever unshaken, while they enjoy the rights of Englishmen; that is, with the consent of their sovereign, the right of legislation each for themselves; for this puts them on an exact level, in this respect, with their fellow subjects in the old provinces, and better than this they could not be by any change in their power. But if the old provinces should often exercize the right of making laws for the new, they would probably grow as restless as the Corsicans, when they perceived they were no longer fellow subjects, but the subjects of subjects.  
To illustrate this matter by a comparison; Should it happen, through the revolutions of time, that some future king should make choice of Ireland for his seat of government, and that the parliament of that kingdom, with his majesty’s concurrence, should assume the right of taxing the people of England, would the people of England quietly acquiesce, or implicitly pay obedience to laws made by virtue of such an assumed right? And yet, as there is no law in being to prevent his majesty from making any part of his dominions the seat of his government, the case is by no means foreign to the present question.  
The laws made here to tax the Americans affect them as a distinct body, in which the law makers are in no manner whatever, comprehended; whereas the laws made to tax Great-Britain, affect alike every member who gives his concurrence to such law. And hence arises the essential difference between real and virtual representations, so much agitated.  
Your correspondent observes, “that we are loaded with 130 millions of debt; great part of which, was contracted by defending the Americans, and therefore that they are bound in gratitude, &amp;c.” Were this argument of weight, and were the right of taxing to follow the obligation of defence, we have expended more than the whole sum on various occasions, in defence of the balance of power on the continent. Will your correspondent for that reason, argue, that Great-Britain has a right of taxing her friends in Germany? Hanover for instance, was formerly said to have cost this nation immense sums for its defence; and Hanover is a district under the obedience of the king of Great-Britain. Will it follow that we have any right to tax Hanover, or that Hanover, in gratitude for the sums we have expended in her behalf, should implicitly give up her ancient rights?  
Upon the whole, the point in dispute does not depend on gratitude or defence, but on the right of Englishmen to give their own money with their own consent. While the Americans were in possession of that right, or thought themselves in possession of it, every requisition for that purpose by the king or his ministers was chearfully complyed with; but since that right, by the mistaken policy of one man,  has been brought in question; murmuring and discontent have succeeded, and every artifice is now practiced to withhold sums levied by a new mode; which had they been demanded in the old way, would have been willingly granted. I am, Sir, &amp;c.

YOUR anonymous correfpondent,  
  
(See Vol. xxxvii. p. 620.) hag  
declaimed on a fubjeét, which by an  
unhappy combination of ignorance  
and obitinacy has become very like a  
bone.of contention between the  
young and the old provinces of this  
great common-wealth.  
  
It feldom happens in difputes of  
any kind but that one fide or the other  
lay the foundations of their arguments  
on error; it happens more particular-  
ly, fo with your angry correfpondent,  
for whofe information I will beg leave  
to give a fhort tketch of the Britifh  
conttitution.  
  
The Britith ftate or empire confifts  
of feveral iflands and other diftant  
countries, afunder in different parts -  
of the globe, éut all united in aqlle-  
giance to one Prince, and to the commen  
Jaw (Scotland excepted) as it exifted  
in the old provinces or mother coun-  
try, before the colonies or new pro-  
vinces were formed. The prince,  
with a felect parliament, or afembly”  
make the legiflative power of and for  
each province within itfelf. Where  
vicinity made it convenient, feveral  
iftands and provinces were at fundry  
times confolidated, and reprefented  
by one parliament, as the Ifle of Wight,  
Cornwall, Wales, Chefhire, Durham,  
and Scotland; by which means all  
Great Britain and its contiguous. ifles,  
are unitedly reprefented in one affem-  
bly in parliament. It has not as yet  
been thought proper to unite Ireland  
to the old provinces, though lying ve-  
ry near; nor any of the provinces of  
America, which lie at a great diftance.  
But notwithftanding this ftate of fe-  
parate affembhies, the allegiance of the  
diftant provinces to the crown will  
  
remain

remain for ever anfhaken, while they  
enjoy the rights of Englithmen; that  
is, with the confent of their fovereign,  
the right of legiflation each for them  
felves; for this puts them on an exact  
level, in this refpect, with their fellow  
fubjeéts in the old provinces, and bet-  
ter than this they could not be by any  
change in their power, But if the  
old provinces fhould often exerecile  
the right of making laws for the new,  
they would frobabiy grow as rettlefa  
as the Corficans, when they perceived  
they were no longer fellow fubjeéts,  
but the fubjeéts of fubjects.  
  
To illuftrate this matter by a com-  
parifon ; Should ic happen, through the  
revolutions of time, that fome tuture  
king fhould make choice of Ireland for  
his feat of government, and that the  
parliament of that kingdom, with his  
majefty’s concurrence, fhould affume  
the right of taxing the people of En-  
gland, would the people of England  
quietly acquiefce, or implicitly pay  
obedience to laws made by virtue of  
fuch an affumed right? Andyet, as  
there is no law in being to prevent  
his majefty from making any part of  
his dominions the feat ot his govern-  
ment, the cafe is by no means foreign  
to the-prefent quettion,  
  
The laws made here to tax the A-  
mericans affect them asa diitiné bo-  
dy, in which the law makers are in  
no manner whatever, comprehended ;  
whereas the laws made to tax Great-  
Britain, affe&amp;t alike every member who  
gives his concurrence to fuch law.  
And herice arifes the effential differ-  
ence between real and virtial repre-  
feiitations, {6 mach agitated.  
  
Your correfpondent obferves, ¢ that  
© we are loaded with 140 ntillions of  
* debt ; great part of which, was con-  
* trated by detending the Americans,  
* and therefore that they are bound  
* in gratitude, &amp;c.” Were this argu-  
ment of weight, and were the right  
of taxing to follow the obligation of  
defence, we have ¢xpenided more than  
the whole fum 6n various occafions,  
in defence of the balance of power on  
the continent. Will your correfpon-  
dent for that reafon, argue, - that  
Great-Britain has a right of taxing  
her friends in Germany? Hanover for  
inftance, was formerly faid to have cof  
this nation immenfé fams for its de-  
fence; and Hanover isa diftri&amp; under  
the obedience of ttie king of Great-  
Britain. Will it follow that we have  
any right to tax Hanover, or that Ha-  
nover, in gratitude for the fais we  
have expended in her behalf, fhould  
implicitly giveup her ancient rights ?  
  
Upon the whole, the point in dif-  
pute does not depend on gratitude ot  
defence, but on the right cf Englith-  
men to give their own money with  
their own confent, While the Ame-  
ricans were in poffeffion cf that right,  
or thought themfelves in pofieffion ¢ f  
it, every requifition for that purpote  
by the king or his minifters was  
chenrfally complyed with; but fince  
that right, by the miftaken policy of  
one man, has been brought in queition ;  
murmuring and difcontent has fuc-  
ceeded, and every artifice is now  
practiced to withold fums levied dy a  
new mode; which had they been de-  
manded in the old way, would have  
been willingly granted.
