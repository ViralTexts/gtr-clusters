esent State of Affairs in America, and Discourse thereupon, he said to me, ‘You Americans have wrong Ideas of the Nature of your Constitution; you contend that the King’s Instructions to his Governors are not Laws, and think yourselves at Liberty to disregard them at your own Discretion. But those Instructions are not like the Pocket Instructions given to a Minister going abroad, for regulating his Conduct in some trifling Point of Ceremony. They are first drawn up by Judges learned in the Laws; they are then considered, debated and perhaps amended in Council, after which they are signed by the King. They are then so far as relates to you, the Law of the Land; for The King is the Legislator of the Colonies.’ I told his Lordship this was new Doctrine to me. I had always understood from our Charters, that our Laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the King for his Royal Assent, but that being once given the King could not repeal or alter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent Laws without his Assent, so neither could he make a Law for them without theirs. He assur’d me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so however. And his Lordship’s Conversation having a little alarm’d me as to what might be the Sentiments of the Court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I return’d to my Lodgings.”

as one of the most valuable in the book, It  
describes an interview with Lord Granville, in  
which the perverse nobleman endeavored in  
1772 toinstruct Franklin as to the nature of the  
American constitution. His views were to the  
simple effect that the king’s instructions to his  
governors, from the fact that they were drawn by  
learned judges, considered in council, and signed  
by the King, became, as far as they related to  
the Colonists, the daw of the land, for the King

propound the tenet that the king’s instructions to his  
governors in America were the law of the land, and that  
the king himself must be regarded as “ the legislator of the  
colonies?” This was a strange view to Dr. Franklin, who  
had always supposed that the right tc make the laws was  
vested in the provincial assemblies, with the king’s approval.  
And he significantly tells us: “His lordship’s conversation  
having a little alarmed me as to what might be the sentiments  
of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I re-  
turned to my lodgings.”*
