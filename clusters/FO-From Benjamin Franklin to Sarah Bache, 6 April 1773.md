l 6. 1773  
I received your pleasing Letter of Jan. 5. I am glad you have undertaken the Care of the Housekeeping, as it will be an Ease to your Mother, especially if you can manage to her Approbation; that may perhaps be at first a Difficulty. It will be of Use to you if you get a Habit of keeping exact Accounts; and it will be some Satisfaction to me to see them. Remember, for your Encouragement in good Œconomy, that whatever a Child saves of its Parents Money, will be its own another Day. Study Poor Richard a little, and you may find some Benefit from his Instructions. I long to be with you all, and to see your Son. I pray God to bless him and you: being ever Your affectionate Father
