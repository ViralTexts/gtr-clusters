MICROMEGA.  
In a recent issue, All the Year Round reproduces one of Voltaire&#x27;s satirical stories, which, though written over a century ago, is just as readable, and probably as pointed in its wit and application today as when first published. The story is introduced in All the Tear Round by the following paragraph:  
Francois-Marie Arouet, wit, poet, dramatist, historian, philosopher, satirist, speculator, man of science, man of affairs, man of gallantry - who made for himself the famous name Voltaire - found the wiseacres of the French Academy of Sciences droning off into the slumber of self-complacency. They had decided to their complete satisfaction that there were no other habitable worlds than ours, that there were no inhabitants of the world worth speaking of except Frenchmen, that there were no Frenchmen besides Parisians, and that there were no Parisians deserving mention outside the Academy. Voltaire put this stinging nettle into their bed:  
In one of those huge planets which wheel around Sirius, the dog-star, there lived a very intelligent young man, whom I had the pleasure of meeting the last time he visited the little ant hill we call earth. He was called Micromega, a name which, for that matter, well expresses the comparative insignificance of all great people. He was twenty-four miles high. When I say twenty-four miles I mean it he measured a hundred and twenty thousand feet in his stockings.  
Now place any geometrician in possession of this gentleman&#x27;s height, and he will at once sit down and calculate; that since a globe of twenty-five thousand miles round produces a man of about five and a half feet high, the planet which Mr. Micromega inhabited must necessarily have a circumference just twenty-one millions six hundred thousand times greater than our tiny earth. Nature, you see, is orderly and proportionate in all her works.  
Such being the height of his highness, an artist will readily ascertain that he must have measured fifty thousand feet round the waist whilst, since the nose is a third of the length of the human face, and the face again the seventh part of the height, it follows that the Sirian&#x27;s nose must have measured nearly a mile and a half in length.

Allowing him to be of the height abovementioned, all our  
sculptors and painters will agree, that he must have measured  
fifty thousand feet round the waist; and this being the case, no  
one can deny that his figure was fine. His understanding was  
highly cultivated, and his knowledge very extensive; he was,  
moreover, the author of several rare inventions. While he wa

Francois-Mariz AROovET, wit, poet, dra-  
matist, historian, philosopher, satirist, spe-  
culator, man of science, man of affairs,  
man of gallantry—who made for himself  
the famous name Voltaire—found the wise-  
acres of the French Academy of Sciences  
droning off into the slumber of self-com-  
placency. They had decided to their com-  
plete satisfaction that there were no other  
habitable worlds than ours; that there  
were no inhabitants in the world, worth  
speaking of, except Frenchmen; that there  
were no Frenchmen besides Parisians; and  
that there were no Parisians deserving  
mention outside the Academy. Voltaire  
put this stinging-nettle into their bed.  
  
  
  
In one of those huge planets which  
wheel round Sirius, the dog-star, there  
lived a very intelligent young man, whom  
I had the pleasure of meeting the last time  
he visited the little ant-hill we call earth.  
He was called Micromega, a name which  
for that matter well expresses the compa-  
rative insignificance of all great people.  
He was twenty-four miles high. When I  
say twenty-four miles, I mean it : he mea-  
sured a hundred and twenty thousand feet  
in his stockings.  
  
Now, place any geometrician in posses-  
sion of this gentleman’s height, and he  
will at once sit down and calculate, that  
since a globe of twenty-five thousand  
miles round produces a man of about five  
and a half feet high, the planet which Mr.  
Micromega inhabited must necessarily have  
a circumference just twenty-one millions  
six hundred thousand times greater than  
our tiny earth. Nature, you see, is orderly  
and proportionate in all her works.  
  
Such being the height of his highness,  
an artist will readily ascertain that he  
must have measured fifty thousand feet  
round the waist; whilst, since the nose is  
a third of the length of the human face,  
avd the face again the seventh part of the  
height, it follows that the Sirian’s nose  
must have measured nearly a mile and a  
half in length.

Said she, ‘Tray tell me, if you can,  
Why go bashful are ?  
They fall in love, and dream, and sigh,  
And worship us afar;  
But when they strive to tell the tale,  
They stutter, hesitate—aud fail I  
We ladies like a man, you know,  
One not afraid to speak—”  
And here I thought a blush appeared  
Upon the maiden&#x27;s check,  
Then to myself I said, “Isee  
This maiden’s heart belongs to me.”  
Then out I spake: “Oh, lady fair,  
My heart, my life is thine !  
And since I boldly speak my love,  
Pray wilt thou not he mine ?”  
“No, Sir!” said she, with wondering stare.
