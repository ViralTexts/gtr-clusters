London, July 14. 1773.  
I received yours of June 7. and am glad to find by it that you are safely return’d from your Virginia Journey, having settled your Affairs there to Satisfaction, and that you found your Family well at New York.  
I feel for you in the Fall you had out of your Chair. I have had three of those Squelches in different Journeys, and never desire a fourth.  
I do not think it was without Reason that you continu’d so long one of St. Thomas’s Disciples; for there was always some Cause for doubting. Some People always ride before the Horses Head. The Draft of the Patent is at length got into the Hands of the Attorney General, who must approve the Form before it passes the Seals. So one would think much more time can scarce be required to compleat the Business: But ’tis good not to be too sanguine. He may go into the Country; and the Privy Councellors likewise; and some Months pass before they get together again. Therefore if you have any Patience, use it.  
  
I suppose Mr. Finlay will be some time at Quebec in settling his Affairs. By the next Packet, you will receive a Draft of Instructions for him.  
In mine of Dec. 2. upon the Post Office Accounts, to Apr. 1772 I took Notice to you, that I observed I had full Credit for my Salary, but no Charge appear’d against me for Money paid on my Account to Mrs. Franklin from the Philadelphia Office. I supposed the Thirty Pounds Currency per Month was regularly paid, because I had had no Complaint from her for want of Money: and I expected to find the Charge in the Accounts of the last Year, that is to Ap. 5. 1773. But nothing of it appearing there, I am at a loss to understand it, and you take no Notice of my Observation above mention’d. The great Ballance due from that Office begins to be remark’d here, and I should have thought the Officer would for his own sake not have neglected to lessen it, by showing what he had paid on my Account. Pray, my dear Friend, explain this to me.  
I find by yours to Mr. Todd, that you expected soon another little One. God send my Daughter a good Time, and you a Good Boy. Mrs. Stevenson is pleas’d with your Remembrance of her, and joins with Mr. and Mrs. Hewson and my self in best Wishes for you and yours. I am, ever, Yours affectionately  
B Franklin

Lonpon, 14 July, 1773.  
To Mr. Foxcrort.  
  
Dear Friend:—TI received yours of June 7th, and am glad to find by it that  
you are safely returned from your Virginia journey. having settled your affairs  
there to satisfaction, and that you found your family well at New York.  
  
I feel for you in the fall you had out of your chair. I have had three of  
those squelchers in different journeys, and never desire a fourth.  
  
I do not think it was without reason that you continued so long one of  
St. Thomas’ disciples: for there was always some cause for doubting. Some  
people always ride before the horse’s head. The draft of the patent is at length  
got into the hands of the Attorney General, who must approve the form before  
it passes the seals, so one would think much more time can scarce be required  
to complete the business; but ’t is good not to be too sanguine. He may go  
into the country, and the Privy Councillors likewise, and some months elapse  
before they get together again: therefore, if you have any patience, use it.  
  
I suppose Mr. Finlay will be some time at Quebec in settling his affairs.  
By the next packet you will receive a draft of instructions for him.  
  
In mine of December 2d, upon the post-office accounts to April, 1772, I  
took notice to you that I observed T had full credit for mv salarv: but no charge  
appeared against me for money paid on my account to Mrs. Franklin from the  
Philadelphia office. T supposed the thirtv pounds currency per month was regu-  
larly paid, because T had had no complaint from her for want of money, and  
T expected to find the charge in the accounts of the last year—that. is, to April  
3, 1773: but nothing of it appearing there, I am at a loss to understand it, and  
vou take no notice of my observation above mentioned. The great balance due  
from that office begins to be remarked here, and I should have thought the  
officer would, for his own sake. not have neglected to lessen it by showing what  
he had paid on my account. Pray, my dear friend, explain this to me.  
  
T find by vours to Mr. Todd that you expected soon another little one. God  
send my daughter a good time, and you a good boy. Mrs. Stevenson is pleased  
with your remembrance of her, and joins with Mr. and Mrs. Hewson and myself  
in best wishes for you and yours.  
  
T am ever yours affectionately,  
B. FRANKLIN.
