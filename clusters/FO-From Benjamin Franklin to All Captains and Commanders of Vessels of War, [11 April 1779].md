Franklin says that the ‘‘ mission on the coast  
of Labrador, for the conversion of the savages  
there to the Christian religion, has already  
had good effects in turning them from their  
anciert practices of surprising, plundering  
and murdering such white people as for pur-  
poses of trade or fishery happened to come on  
that coast, and persuading them to lead a new  
life of honest industry and to treat strangers  
with humanity and kindness.”
