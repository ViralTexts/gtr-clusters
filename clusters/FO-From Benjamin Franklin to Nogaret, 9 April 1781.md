I received duly the elegant Present of your Poetical Works. I thank you much for the Pleasure I have had in perusing them. I should have made this Acknowledgement sooner; but intending to request your Acceptance of my Opuscules in Return, I have been retarded by the Bookbinder who has not yet dress’d them decently enough to appear at Court. With great regard, I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant
