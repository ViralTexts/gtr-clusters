 Life.” The plan does not appear in the surviving transcript of the Journal, and is probably lost. About 1785, however, Franklin allowed William Rawle, a fellow member of the Society for Political Inquiries, to make a copy of “the preamble and heads of it”; and Rawle, in 1815, gave this material to his friend Robert Walsh of Philadelphia for a sketch of Franklin. Walsh seems to have printed only a part of what Rawle sent him—the part that appears here. Franklin considered his plan “the more remarkable, as being form’d when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfully adhered to quite thro’ to old Age.”  
  
[1726]  
Those who write of the art of poetry teach us that if we would write what may be worth the reading, we ought always, before we begin, to form a regular plan and design of our piece: otherwise, we shall be in danger of incongruity. I am apt to think it is the same as to life. I have never fixed a regular design in life; by which means it has been a confused variety of different scenes. I am now entering upon a new one: let me, therefore, make some resolutions, and form some scheme of action, that, henceforth, I may live in all respects like a rational creature.  
1. It is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time, till I have paid what I owe.  
2. To endeavour to speak truth in every instance; to give nobody expectations that are not likely to be answered, but aim at sincerity in every word and action—the most amiable excellence in a rational being.  
3. To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand, and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of growing suddenly rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty.  
4. I resolve to speak ill of no man whatever, not even in a matter of truth; but rather by some means excuse the faults I hear charged upon others, and upon proper occasions speak all the good I know of every body.
