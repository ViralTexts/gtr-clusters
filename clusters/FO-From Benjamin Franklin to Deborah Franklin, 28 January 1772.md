The Squirrels came safe and well. You will see by the enclos’d how welcome they were. A 1000 Thanks are sent you for them, and I thank you for the Readiness with which you executed the Commission.  
My Love to our dear Precious, to Polley Hunt, and all our kind enquiring Friends. Mrs. Montgomery’s Health is I hope establish’d, as also that of our dear Friend Rhoads and his Family.  
The Buckwheat and Indian Meal are come safe and good. They will be a great Refreshment to me this Winter. For since I cannot be in America, every thing that comes from thence comforts me a little, as being something like Home. The dry’d Peaches too are excellent, those dry’d without the Skin; the Parcel in their Skins are not so good. The Apples are the best I ever had and came with the least Damage. The Sturgeon you mention did not come: but that is not so material.

MY DEAR CHILD: I thank you for the  
sauce boats, and am pleased to find so good a  
progress made in the china manufactorles. I  
wish it success most heartily,  The  
squirrels came safe and well.A hun­  
dred thanks are sent you, and I thank you for  
the readiness with which you executed the  
commission. The buckwheat and Indian meal  
are come safe and good. They will be a great  
refreshment to me this winter; for, since I can­  
not be in America, everything that comes from  
thence comforts me a little as being something  
like home. The dried peaches, too, are excel­  
lent--those dried without the skins. The par­  
cel in their skins are not so good. The apples  
are the best I ever had and come with least  
damage. The sturgeon you mention did not  
come, but that is not so material. I  
was in Ireland about seven weeks, in Scotland  
about four weeks, absent from London in all  
more than three months. My tour was a very  
pleasant one. I received abundance of civill­  
ties from the gentry of both kingdoms, and my  
health is improved by the air and exercise,
