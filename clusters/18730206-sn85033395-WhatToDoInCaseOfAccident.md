What to Do in Case of Accident.**  
  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University, gives these short rules for action in case of accident. It would not be a bad thing to cut them out and carry them in one&#x27;s pocketbook, or, better yet, commit them to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing; dash water in them, remove cinders, etc, with the round point of a lead pencil.   
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water—never put a hard instrument into the ear.  
  
If an artery is cut, compress above the wound; if a vein is cut, compress below.   
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold water, if the skin is destroyed cover with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc,; water will spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before passing through smoke, take a full breath and then stoop low; but if carbon is suspected, walk erect.   
  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or, better, cut out the part without delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling the throat or by warm water and mustard.  
  
For acid poisons, give alkalies, for alkaline poisons, give acids—white of egg is good in most cases; in case of opium poisoning, give strong coffee, and keep moving.  
  
For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person flat.

Rules for Accidents  
  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University,  
gives these short rules for action in cases  
of accident. It would not be a bad  
thing to cut them out and carry them  
in one’s pocket-book; or, better yet,  
commit them to memory :  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing ;  
dash water into them ; remove cinders,  
etc., with the round point of a lead pen-  
cil.  
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid  
water ; never put a hard instrument into  
the ear.  
  
If an artery is cut, compress above  
the wound; if a vein is cut, compres  
below.  
  
If choked, get upon all fours and  
cough.  
  
or slight burns, dip the part in cold  
water; if the skin is destroyed, cover  
with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc.;  
water will often spread burning oil, and  
increase danger. Before passing through  
smoke, take a full breath and stoop low,  
but if carbonic acid gas is suspected,  
walk erect.  
  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or,  
better, cut out the part without delay ;  
hold the wounded part as long as can be  
borne to a hot coal, or end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting  
by tickling the throat, by warm water  
and mustard.  
  
For acid poisons give alkalies ; for al-  
kaline poisons, give acids; white of  
egg is good in most cases; in case of  
oplum-poisoning, give strong coffee, and  
keep moving.  
  
If in the water, float on the back,  
with the nose and mouth projecting.  
  
For apenety raise the head and  
body ; for fainting, lay flat.

What to do in Case or &#x27;Accident.  
I&#x27;rof. Wilder, of Cornell University,  
gives the following short rules for action in  
cases of accident, which it will be found  
useful to preserve or remember :  
For dust in the eJwf avoid rubbing ; dash  
water into them ; remove cinders, etc.,  
with the round point of a lead peucil.  
Remove water from the ear by tepid wa­  
ter ; never put a hard instrument into the  
ear.  
If any artery is cut, compress above  
the wound ; if a vein is cut, compress  
below.  
Tf chokeu, get upon all fours and cough.  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold  
water ; if the skin is destroyod, cover with  
varnish.  
Smother a lire witli carpels, fcc. ; water  
will often spread burning oil, and increase  
danger. Before passing through smoke,  
take a full breath and then stoop low; but  
if carbonic acid gas is suspected, walk  
erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unlets your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or,  
better cut out the part without delay ;  
hold the wounded part as long as can be  
borne to a hot coal or end of a cigar.  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by  
tickling the throat or by warm water and  
mustard.  
For acid poisons, give alkalis; for alka­  
line poisons, give acids white of egg is  
good in most cases ; in a case of opium  
poisoning give strong coilee and keep

spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before  
passing through smoke, take a full breath, and then

delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne  
toa hot coal or the end of a cigar.

What to do in Case of Accident.  
— Professar Wilder, of Cornell  
Universitv (says Moore&#x27;s Rural  
NewYorker) gives the following short  
rules for actien in case of accident,  
which will be found useful to remember :  
— For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing ;  
dash water in them ; remove cinders, &amp;c,  
with the round point of a lead pencil.  
Remove water from the ear by tepid water  
; never put a hard instrument into the  
ear. If any artery is cut, compress  
above the wound ; if a vein is cut,  
compress below. If choked, get on all  
fours and cough. For slight burns, dip  
the part in cold water ; if the skin is  
destroyed, cover with varnish. Smother a  
fire with carpets, &amp;c. ; water will  
often spread burning oil, and increase  
the danger. Before passing through smoke  
take a long breath, and then stoop low ;  
out if carbonic acid gas is suspected,  
walk erect. Suck poisoned wounds, unless  
your mouth is sore ; enlarge the wound,  
or, better cut out the part without  
delay ; hold the wounded part as long as  
can be borne to a hot coal or end of a  
cigar. In case of poisoning, excite  
vomitingby tickling the throat, or by  
warm water and mustard. Ijor acid  
poisons, give alkalies ; for alkaline  
poisons, give acids — white of egg is  
good in most cases ; in a case of  
opiumpoisoning give strong coffee, and  
keep moving. If in water, float on the  
back, with the nose and mouth  
projecting. For apoplexy, raise the head  
and body ; for fainting lay the person  
flat.

in the eye, avoid rubbing, dash water  
into them; remove cinders, eta, with  
the round point of a lead pencil. Re  
move insects from the ear by tepid water;  
never put a hard instrument into the  
ear. If an artery is cut, compress above  
the wound ; if a vein is cut, compress be  
low. If choked, get upon all fours, and  
cough. For light burns, dip the part in  
cold water; if the skin is destroyed, cov­

carbon is suspected, then walk erect.  
Suck poison wounds, unless your mouth

the wounded part as long as can be borne  
to a hot coal, or end of a cigar. In case  
of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling  
the throat, or by water or mustard. For  
acid poisons, give aeids; in case of opium  
poisoning, give strong coffee and keep  
moving. If in water, float on the back,  
with the nose and mouth projecting.

PreSeNCE oF MINd In ACCIDENTS.  
Professor Wilder gives these short rules  
for action in case of accident: For dust  
in the eyes, avoid rubbing, and dash  
water into them; remove cinders, &amp;c.,  
with the round end of a lead pencil.  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid  
water; never put a hard instrument  
into the ear. If an artery is cut, com­  
press below. If choked, get upon all  
fours and cough. For light burns, dip  
the part in cold water. Smother the  
fire with carpets, &amp;e.; water will often  
spread burning oil, and increase the  
danger. Before passing through smoke  
take a full breath, and then stoop low,  
but if carbon is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds unless your  
mouth is sore. Enlarge the wound,  
or, better, eut out the part without  
delay. Hold the wounded part as long  
as can be borne to a hot coal or end of  
a eigar. In case of poisoning, excite  
vomiting by tickling the throat or by  
hot mustard. For acid poisons, give  
acids; in case of opium poisoning, give  
strong coffee and keep moving. If  
you fall into water, float on the back,  
th the nose and mouth projecting.  
For  
apoplexy, raise the head and body;

Presence of Mind.—Professor Wilder,  
of Cornell University, gives the following  
short rules for action in case of accident:  
Por dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, dash  
water into them; remove cinders, &amp;e., with  
the round point of a lead pencil; remove  
insects from the ear by tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument into the ear. If an  
artery is cut, compress above the wound;  
if a vein is cut, compress below. If choked,  
get upon all fours and cough. For light  
burns, dip the part in cold water; if the  
skin is destroyed, cover with varnish. Smo­

bon is suspected, walk erect. Suck poison  
wounds unless your mouth is sore; enlarge

For slight burns, dip the part in

Smother a fire with carpets, etc.,  
water will often spread burning oil,

What to I)o in Case of Accident.  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University,  
gives these rules for action in case of  
accident. It would not lie a had thing  
to cut them out and carry them in  
one&#x27;s pocket-book, or, better yet, com­  
them to memory:  
For dust in the eyes avo d rubbing,  
dash water into them; remove cinders  
with the round point of a lead pencil.  
Remove insects from the car by te­  
pid water; never put a hard substance  
into the ear.  
If an artery is cut compress above  
the wound, if a vein is cut compress  
below.  
If choki&#x27;d get upon all-fours aud  
cough.  
For slight burns dip the part in cold  
water, it* tlie.skin is destroyed cover  
with varnish.  
Smother a tire with carpets, etc.  
Water will often spread burning oil  
and increase danger Before passing  
through smoke take a full breath and  
then stoop low ; if carbonic gas is sus­  
pected walk epect.  
Stick poisoned &#x27;wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore ; enlarge the wound, or  
1 letter, cut out the part without delay,  
hold the wounded part as long as can  
be borne to a hot coal.  
In case of poisoning excite vomiting  
l*y tickling the throat and by warm  
water and mustard.  
For acid poisons give alkalies, for  
alkaline poisons give acids; white of  
an egg is good in most cases; in case  
of opium poisoning give* strong coffee  
and keep moving.  
If in the water float on the back,  
with nose and month projecting.  
For apoplexy raise the head

Professor Wilder of Cornell Univer­  
sity gives the following short rules for  
action in case of accident which it  
will be found useful to preserve or re­  
member :  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing:  
dash water into them ; remove cin­  
ders, etc., with the round point of a  
lead pencil.  
Remove matter from the car with  
tepid water ; never put a hard instru­  
ment into the ear.  
If an artery is cut, compress above  
the wound ; if a vein is eut&gt; compress  
below.  
If choked, get upon all fours, and  
cough.  
For slight burns, dip the part in  
cold water; if the skin is destroyed,  
cover with varnish.  
Smother fire with carpets, etc.;  
water will often spread burning oil  
and increase danger. Before passing  
through smoke, take a full breath,  
and then stoop low; but if carbonic  
acid gas is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound,  
or, better, cut out the part without  
delay ; hold the wounded part as long  
as can be borne to a hot coal or end  
of a cigar.  
In case of poisoning, excite vomit­

water and mustard.  
If in water, float on the back, with  
the nose and mouth projecting.  
For apoplexy, raise the head and  
body; for fainting, lay the person  
flat.—Selected.

.   
What to Do in Case of Accidents.   
The following short rules for action,  
in cases of accident, will be found use­  
ful to remember. For dust in the eyes  
avoid rubbing—dash water in them; re­  
move cinders, etc., with the round  
point of a lead pencil. Remove wax  
from the ear with tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument in the ear. If  
any artery is cut compress above the  
wound; if a vein is cut, compress be­  
low. If choking, get on all fours and  
cough. For slight burns dip the parts  
in cold water—if the skin is destroyed,  
cover with a paste of whitening and  
water. Smother a fire with carpets,  
etc.: water will often spread burning  
oil and increase the danger. Before  
passing through smoke take a long  
breath and then stoop low; but, if car­  
bonic acid gas is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or,  
better still, cut out the part without  
delay; hold the wounded part as long  
as can be borne to a hot coal, or end of  
a lighted cigar. In case of poisoning  
excite vomiting by tickling the throat,  
or by warm water and mustard. For  
acid poisons give alkalies, for alkaline  
poisons give acids; white of egg is  
good in most cases; in case of opium  
poisoning give strong coffe and keep  
moving. If in water float on the back  
with nose and mouth projecting. For  
apoplexy, raise the head and body; for  
fainting, lay the person flat.   
Diffident Daughters.   
It is a painful spectacle in families  
where a mother is the drudge, to see  
the daughters, elegantly dressed, re­  
clining at their ease, with their draw­  
ing, their music, meir fancy work, and  
their reading, beguiling themselves of  
the lapse of hours, days and weeks,  
and never dreaming of their responsi­  
bilities, but, as a necessary consequence  
of neglect of duty, growing weary of  
their useless lives, laying hold of every  
newly invented stimulant to arouse  
their drooping energy, and blaming  
their fate, when they dare not blame  
their God,for having placed them where  
they are. These individuals will often  
tell you, with an air of affected com­  
passion—for who can believe it real?—  
that “poor mamma” is working herself  
to death; yet no sooner do you propose  
that they should assist her than they  
declare that she is quite in her ele­  
ment—in short,that she would never be  
happy if she had only half as  
much to do.

the lapse of hours, days and weeks,  
and never dreaming of their responat­  
bilities, but, as a necessary consequence  
of neglect of duty, growing weacy of  
their useless lives, laying hold of every  
newly invented stimulant to arouse  
their drooping energy, and blaming  
their fate, when they dare not blame  
their God, for having placed them where  
they are. These individuals will often  
tell you, with an air of affected com­  
passion,-for who can believe it real?  
that &quot;poor mamma&quot; is working herself  
to death; yet no sooner do you propose  
that they should assist her than they  
declare that she is quite in her ele­  
ment--in short, that she would never be  
happy if she had only half as  
much to do.
