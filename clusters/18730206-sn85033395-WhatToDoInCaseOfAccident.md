**What to Do in Case of Accident.**  
  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University, gives these short rules for action in case of accident. It would not be a bad thing to cut them out and carry them in one&#x27;s pocketbook, or, better yet, commit them to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing; dash water in them, remove cinders, etc, with the round point of a lead pencil.   
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water—never put a hard instrument into the ear.  
  
If an artery is cut, compress above the wound; if a vein is cut, compress below.   
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold water, if the skin is destroyed cover with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc,; water will spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before passing through smoke, take a full breath and then stoop low; but if carbon is suspected, walk erect.   
  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or, better, cut out the part without delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling the throat or by warm water and mustard.  
  
For acid poisons, give alkalies, for alkaline poisons, give acids—white of egg is good in most cases; in case of opium poisoning, give strong coffee, and keep moving.  
  
For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person flat.

handsome profit. The same facts hold  
  
good in raising young cattle. Those  
raised by some men are a? large at two  
years old as those raised by others are  
at three. Much, or nearly ail, rests with

water never put a hard instrument  
into the ear.  
If an artery is cut, compress above the  
the wound ; if a vein is cut, compress  
below.  
If choked, get upon all fours and  
coukh.  
For flight burns, dip the part in cold  
water; if the the skin is destroyed,  
cover with varnish.  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc. ,  
water will often spread burning oil, and  
increase the danger. Before passing  
through smoke, take a full breath and  
then stoop low, but if cJrbon is sus­  
pected, walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is tore ; enlarge the wound, or,  
better, cut out the part without delay ;  
hold the wounded part as long as can be  
borne to a hot coal or end of a cigar.  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting  
by tickling the throat or by warm water

For acid noisons, tive alkalii : for

In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling

Frof. Wilder, of Cornell University  
gives the following short rules for ac  
tion in case ot acccidcnt, which it will  
be found useful to preserve or remeni

For dust in the eye avoid rubbing  
dash water iuto them; remove cinder,

For slight burns, dip the part in  
cold water ; if the skin is destroyed,  
cover with varnish.  
Smother a fire with carpets, &amp;c. ;

walk eroct.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, er  
better, cut out the part without delay;  
hold the wounded part as long as can be  
borne to a coal or the end f a cigar.  
In case of poisoning, excite vomit­  
ing by tickling the throat, or warm  
water and mustard.  
For acid poisons, give alkalis ; for  
alkaline poisons give acids; whit of  
an egg is good in most cases ; in a

which hang like a funeral pall over  
the dying earth. But soon the sun  
scorches up these vapor banks anc,  
dissipates them into space as fast as  
they can be formed by evaporation.—  
Then the fiery orb shines out in unut­  
■ terable splendor without the lightest  
cloud-wreath to interpose between  
himself and his victims. Then, truly,  
the heavens become as iron and the  
earth as brass. Then the last denizens

What to Do in Case of Accident  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University,  
gives the following short rules for ac­  
tion in cases of accident, which will be  
found usefnl to remember;  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing;  
dash water in them; remove cinders,  
etc., with the round point of a lead  
pencil.  
Remove water from the ear by tepid  
water; never put a hard instrument in  
the ear.  
If any artery is cut, compress above  
the wound; if a vein is cut, compress  
below.  
If choked, get on all fours aud cough.  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold  
water; if the skin is destroyed, cover  
with varnish.  
- Smother a fire with -carpets, etc.;  
water will often spread burning oil,  
and increase the danger. Before pass­  
ing through smoke take along breath,  
and then stoop low: but if carbolic  
acid gas is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
moth is sore; enlarge the wound, or,  
better cut out the part without delay,  
hold the wounded part as long as can  
be borne to hot coal or end of a cigar.  
In case of poisoning excite vomiting  
by tickling the throat, or by warm  
water- and mustard.  
For acid poisons, gave alkalies; for  
alkaline poisons, give acids—white of  
egg is good in most cases; in a case of  
opium-poisoning give strong coffee,  
and keep moving.  
If in Avater, float on the back with  
the noose and mouth projecting..  
For apoplexy, raise the head and  
body; for fainting, lay the person flat.

RULES TO REMEMBER,  
  
If one only knows what to do in emergencies, he  
can bring comfort to many a sufferer, and save, per-  
haps, dying men. The following rules, by Prof.  
Wilder, of Cornell University, are worth committing  
to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, and dash water  
into them; remove cinders, &amp;c., with the round point  
of a pencil.  
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument into your ear.  
  
If any artery is cut, compress below.  
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, &amp;c.; w’ ‘-r will often  
spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before  
passing through smoke, take a full breath, and then  
stoop low; but if carbonic is suspected, walk erect.  
  
Suck poisoned wounds, or cut out the part without  
delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne  
toa hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling  
the throat, or by warm mu: °  
  
For acid poisons give alkalies; for alkaline poisons  
give acids; white of an egg is good in most cases.

Presence of .Mind.—Prof. Wilder gives  
these short rules for action in case of acci­  
dent: For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing;  
dash water into them; remove cinders,  
etc., with the round point of a lead pencil.  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid wa­  
ter ; never put a hard instrument into the  
ear. If an artery is cut compress above  
the wound. If a vein is cut compress be­  
low. If choked get upon all four sand  
cough.  
For light burns dip the part in cold wa­  
ter; if the skin is destroyed; cover with  
varnish. Smother a fire with carpets, etc.;  
water will often spread burningoil and in­  
crease the danger. Before passing through  
smoke take a full breath, and then stoop  
low, but if carbon is expected, then walk  
erect. Suck poisonous wounds, unless  
your mouth is sore. Enlarge the wound,  
or, better, cut out the part without delay.  
Hold the wounded part ns long as can he  
borne to a hot coal, or end of a cignr. In  
case of poisoning excite vomiting by tick­  
ling the throat, or by water or mustard.  
For acid poison give acids; in case of op­  
ium poisoning give strong coffee and keep  
moving. If in water, float on the hack  
with the nose and mouth projecting. For

Presence of Mind.—Professor Wilder,  
of Cornell University, gives the following  
short rules for action in case of accident:  
Por dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, dash  
water into them; remove cinders, &amp;e., with  
the round point of a lead pencil; remove  
insects from the ear by tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument into the ear. If an  
artery is cut, compress above the wound;  
if a vein is cut, compress below. If choked,  
get upon all fours and cough. For light  
burns, dip the part in cold water; if the  
skin is destroyed, cover with varnish. Smo­  
ther a (ire with carpets, etc.; water will of­  
ten spread burning oil and increase the dan­  
ger. Before passing through smoke, take  
a full breath and then stoop low; but if car­  
bon is suspected, walk erect. Suck poison  
wounds unless your mouth is sore; enlarge  
the wound, or better cut out the part with­  
out delay; hold the wounded part as long  
as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of  
a cigar. In case of poisoning, excite vomit­  
ing by tickling the throat, or by water and  
mustard. For acid poisons, give acids; in  
case of opium poisoning, give strong coffee  
and keep moving. If in water, float on the  
back with the mouth and nose projecting.  
For apoplexy, raise the head and body;  
for fainting, lay the person flat
