**What to Do in Case of Accident.**  
  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University, gives these short rules for action in case of accident. It would not be a bad thing to cut them out and carry them in one&#x27;s pocketbook, or, better yet, commit them to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing; dash water in them, remove cinders, etc, with the round point of a lead pencil.   
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water—never put a hard instrument into the ear.  
  
If an artery is cut, compress above the wound; if a vein is cut, compress below.   
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold water, if the skin is destroyed cover with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc,; water will spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before passing through smoke, take a full breath and then stoop low; but if carbon is suspected, walk erect.   
  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or, better, cut out the part without delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling the throat or by warm water and mustard.  
  
For acid poisons, give alkalies, for alkaline poisons, give acids—white of egg is good in most cases; in case of opium poisoning, give strong coffee, and keep moving.  
  
For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person flat.

What to Do In Case of Accident.  
Professor Wilper, of Cornell Uni-  
ersity, gives these short rules for action  
In cases of accident :  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing,  
dash water into them; remove cinders,  
etc., with the round point ot a lead pen­  
cil.Kemove insects from the ear by tepid  
water : never put a hard instrument into  
the car.  
If an artery is cut, compress above the  
wound ; if a vein is cut, compress below.  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
For light burns, dip the part in cold  
water : il the skin Is destroyed, cover with  
varnish.  
Smother a flrc with carpets, etc. ; water  
will often spread burning oil, and increase  
danger. Uelore passing tnrougn smone,  
take a full breath and then stoop low, but  
if carbon is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck poison wounds, unless your moutu  
is sore. Enlarge the wound, or, better,  
cut out the part without delay. Hold  
the wounded part as long as can be borne  
to a hot coal, or end of a cigar.  
In case or poisoning, excite vomiung  
by tickling the thront, or by warm water  
and mustard. For acid poisons give acids ;  
white of egg 18 good in most cases ; in  
case of opium poisoning, give strong cof­

For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing: dash  
water in them; remove cinders, etc., with the  
round point of a lead pencil.

never put a hard instrument In tne ear.

If choked, get on all fours and cough.  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold wat?t;  
if the skin ia destroyed, cover with varnish.  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc ; water will  
often spread burning oil, and increaae the  
danger. Before passing through amoke t?ke a  
long breath, and then stoop low; but if carbolic  
acid gas is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck |&gt;oisoned wounds, unleae your mouth is  
aore; enlarge the wound, or, better cut out the  
part without delay, hold the wounded part as  
long as can be borne to a hot coal or end of a

ling the throat, or by warm water ana mustard.

Professor Wilder, of Cornell University,

accident:  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, flash  
water into them; remove cinders, etc., with  
the round point of a lead pencil.  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid wa­  
ter; never put a hard instrument into the  
ear.  
If an artery is cut, compress above the  
wound; if a vein is cut, compress below.

is sore. Enlarge the wound, or, better, cut  
out the part without delay. Hold the  
wounded part as long as can be borne to a  
hot coal, or end of a cigar.  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by  
tickling the throat, or by warm water and  
mustard. For acid poison give acids; white  
of egg is good in most cases; in case of  
opium poisoning, give strong coffee and

IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.  
Prof. Wilder gives these short rules for action in  
ease of accident:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, dash water  
into them. Remove cinders, ete., with the round  
— of alead pencil. Remove insects from the ear  
oy tepid water; never put a hard instrument into  
the ear. If an artery is cut, compress above the  
wound; if a vein is cut, compress below. If choked,  
get upon all fours and cough. For light burns, dip  
the part in cold water; if the skin is destroyed, cover  
with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, ete.; water will often  
spread burning oil and increase the danger. Before  
passing through smoke, take a fall breath, and then  
stoop low, but if carbon is suspected, then walk erect.  
  
Suck poisonous wounds, unless your mouth is

What to Doe In Ca of Accident.  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell Univer  
sity, gives these short rules for ac.  
tion in case of accident. It would  
not be a bad thing to cat them out  
and carry them in one&#x27;s pocket.  
book, or, better yet, commit them to  
memor.:  
For dust In the eyes, avoid ruab  
bing; dash water in then; remove  
cinders, etc., with the round point  
of a pencil.  
Remove insects from the ear by  
tepid water--never put a hard in  
strument into the ear.  
If an artery is cut, compress  
above the wound; if a rein is cut,  
compress below.  
If choked, get upon all fours and  
cough.  
For slight burns, dip the part in  
cold water, if the skin is destroyed,  
corer with varnish.  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc.,  
water will often spread burning oil  
and Increase danger. Before passn  
ing through smoke, take a tall  
breath and then stoop low, bet if  
carbon is suspected, walk erect.  
Buck poisoned wounds, unless  
four mouth is sore; enlarge the  
wound, or better, eat the part with­  
cat delay; bold the wp/nded part,  
as long as can e be ane, to a beo

For dust in the eyes avoid rub­

Remove insects from the ear by  
tepid water; never put a hard in­

If an artery i3 cut, compress

compress below.  
If choked, get upon all four and  
cough.  
For slight burns, dip the part in  
cold water. If the skin is de­  
stroyed cover with varnish.  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc.,  
water will often spread burning oil,  
and increase danger. Before pass­  
ing through smoke, take a full  
  
breath, and then stoop low; but if  
carbonic acid is suspected, walk  
erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless  
your mouth is sore; enlarge the  
wound, or, better, cut out the part  
without delay; hold the wounded  
part as long as can be borne to a hot  
coal.  
In case of poison excite vomiting  
by tickling the throat, and by warm

What to I)o in Case of Accident.  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University,  
gives these rules for action in case of  
accident. It would not lie a had thing  
to cut them out and carry them in  
one&#x27;s pocket-book, or, better yet, com­  
them to memory:  
For dust in the eyes avo d rubbing,  
dash water into them; remove cinders  
with the round point of a lead pencil.  
Remove insects from the car by te­  
pid water; never put a hard substance  
into the ear.  
If an artery is cut compress above  
the wound, if a vein is cut compress  
below.  
If choki&#x27;d get upon all-fours aud  
cough.  
For slight burns dip the part in cold  
water, it* tlie.skin is destroyed cover  
with varnish.  
Smother a tire with carpets, etc.  
Water will often spread burning oil  
and increase danger Before passing  
through smoke take a full breath and  
then stoop low ; if carbonic gas is sus­  
pected walk epect.  
Stick poisoned &#x27;wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore ; enlarge the wound, or  
1 letter, cut out the part without delay,  
hold the wounded part as long as can  
be borne to a hot coal.  
In case of poisoning excite vomiting  
l*y tickling the throat and by warm  
water and mustard.  
For acid poisons give alkalies, for  
alkaline poisons give acids; white of  
an egg is good in most cases; in case  
of opium poisoning give* strong coffee  
and keep moving
