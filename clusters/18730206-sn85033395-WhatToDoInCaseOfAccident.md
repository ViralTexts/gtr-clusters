**What to Do in Case of Accident.**  
  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University, gives these short rules for action in case of accident. It would not be a bad thing to cut them out and carry them in one&#x27;s pocketbook, or, better yet, commit them to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing; dash water in them, remove cinders, etc, with the round point of a lead pencil.   
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water—never put a hard instrument into the ear.  
  
If an artery is cut, compress above the wound; if a vein is cut, compress below.   
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold water, if the skin is destroyed cover with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc,; water will spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before passing through smoke, take a full breath and then stoop low; but if carbon is suspected, walk erect.   
  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or, better, cut out the part without delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling the throat or by warm water and mustard.  
  
For acid poisons, give alkalies, for alkaline poisons, give acids—white of egg is good in most cases; in case of opium poisoning, give strong coffee, and keep moving.  
  
For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person flat.

Rules for Accidents  
  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University,  
gives these short rules for action in cases  
of accident. It would not be a bad  
thing to cut them out and carry them  
in one’s pocket-book; or, better yet,  
commit them to memory :  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing ;  
dash water into them ; remove cinders,  
etc., with the round point of a lead pen-  
cil.  
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid  
water ; never put a hard instrument into  
the ear.  
  
If an artery is cut, compress above  
the wound; if a vein is cut, compres  
below.  
  
If choked, get upon all fours and  
cough.  
  
or slight burns, dip the part in cold  
water; if the skin is destroyed, cover  
with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc.;  
water will often spread burning oil, and  
increase danger. Before passing through  
smoke, take a full breath and stoop low,  
but if carbonic acid gas is suspected,  
walk erect.  
  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or,  
better, cut out the part without delay ;  
hold the wounded part as long as can be  
borne to a hot coal, or end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting  
by tickling the throat, by warm water  
and mustard.  
  
For acid poisons give alkalies ; for al-  
kaline poisons, give acids; white of  
egg is good in most cases; in case of  
oplum-poisoning, give strong coffee, and  
keep moving.  
  
If in the water, float on the back,  
with the nose and mouth projecting.  
  
For apenety raise the head and  
body ; for fainting, lay flat.

dash water into them ; remove cinders  
etc., with the round point of a pencil.  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid  
water; never put a hard instrument in  
to your ear.  
If an artery is cut, compress below.  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough  
Smother afire with carpets, etc., water  
will often spread burning oil and increase  
danger. Before i passing through smoke,  
take a full breath and then stoop low, but  
it carbonic is suspected walk erect.  
Suck poisoned; wounds, or, cut out the  
part without delay ; hofd the wounded  
part as long as can be borne to a hot coa  
or the end of a cigar.  
In case Of poisoning, excite vomiting  
by tickling the throat, or by warm mus  
tard.  
For acid poisons give alkalies ; for al

RULES TO REMEMBER,  
  
If one only knows what to do in emergencies, he  
can bring comfort to many a sufferer, and save, per-  
haps, dying men. The following rules, by Prof.  
Wilder, of Cornell University, are worth committing  
to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, and dash water  
into them; remove cinders, &amp;c., with the round point  
of a pencil.  
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument into your ear.  
  
If any artery is cut, compress below.  
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, &amp;c.; w’ ‘-r will often  
spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before  
passing through smoke, take a full breath, and then  
stoop low; but if carbonic is suspected, walk erect.  
  
Suck poisoned wounds, or cut out the part without  
delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne  
toa hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling  
the throat, or by warm mu: °  
  
For acid poisons give alkalies; for alkaline poisons  
give acids; white of an egg is good in most cases.  
  
For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for faint-  
ing, lie flat.

Presences of Mind In Accidents.  
Prof. Wilder gives these short rules  
for action in case of accident: For  
dust in the eyes avoid rubbing, and  
dash water into them; remove cinders,  
etc., with the round end of a lead pen  
cil. Remove insects from the ear by  
tepid water; never put a hard instru­  
ment into the ear. If an artery is cut,  
compress above the wound; if a vein  
is cut, compress below. If choked,  
get upon all fours and cough. For  
light burns dip the part in cold water;  
it the skin is destroyed, cover with  
.varnish. Smother a fire with carpets,  
etc, as water will oiten spread burn­  
ing oil and increase the danger. Be  
fore passing through the smoke take  
a full breath, and then stoop low; but  
if carbon is suspected, then walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore. Enlarge the wound,  
or belter, cut out the part without de­  
lay. Hold the wounded part as lon j  
as can be borne to a hot coal or end  
of a cigar. In case of poisoning, ex  
cite vomiting by tickling the throat,  
or by hot water or mustard. For  
acid poisons, give acids; in case of  
ipium poisoning, give strong coffee  
and keep moving. If you fall into the  
water, float on the back, with the  
nose and month projecting. For apo­  
plexy, raise the he,a I and body: for  
fainting, lay the person flat.

 the mind  
has lost its balance, or become too intense  
in certain of its faculties. Nature is a grand  
balm for those souls who feel hurt by so0-  
ciety. Her solitudes and silence calm and  
steady the tossing thoughts, and permit no  
more disturbances. It is not probable that  
this very common desire to be alone will  
ever be entirely eradicated from the human  
heart.  
  
  
  
PRESENCE OF MIND,  
  
Prof. Wilder gives these short rules for  
action in case of accident: For dust in the  
eyes, avoid rubbing ; dash water into them;  
remove cinders, ete., with the round point  
of a lead pencil. (Remove insects from the  
ear by tepid water; never put a hard in-  
atrument into the ear. If an artery is cut  
compress above the wound; ifa vein is cut  
compress below. If choked get upon all  
fours and cough. For light burns dip the  
part in cold water; if the skin is destroyed,  
cover with varnish. Smother a fire with  
carpets, etc.; water will often spread burn-  
ing oiland increase the danger. Before  
passing through smoke, take a full breath,  
and then stoop low, but if carbon is sus-  
pected, then walk erect. Suck poisonous  
wounds, unless your mouth is sore. En-  
large the wound, or, better,cut the part out  
without delay. Hold the wounded part as  
long as can be borne to a hot coal, or end  
of acigar. In case of poisoning, excite  
vomiting by tickling the throat, or by  
water or mustard. For acid poisons give  
acids; in case of opium poisoning give  
strong coffee and keep moving. If in  
water, float on the back with the nose and  
mouth projecting. For apoplexy, raise the  
head and body; for fainting lay the person  
flat.

TESTING WOOD.   
To test the quality of wool, take a  
lock from the sheep’s back, and place it  
on a measured inch. If the spirals count  
from thirty to thirty-three in the space  
of an inch, it equals the finest Electoral  
or Saxony wool grown. The diminution  
of the number folds to the inch shows  
the inferiority.   
GLUE TO RESIST FIRE.   
The London Furniture Gazette gives  
this recipe : Mix a handful of quick­  
lime in four ounces of linseed oil; boil  
to a good thickness, then spread on  
plates in the shade and it will become  
exceedingly hard, but may be easily dis­  
solved over the fire, and used as ordin­  
ary glue. It resists tire after being used  
for glueing substances together.   
TO CLEAN LOOKING-GLASSES.   
Take a newspaper, fold it small, dip it  
in a basin of cold water. When thor­  
oughly wet, squeeze it out as you would  
a sponge; then rub it over the surface of  
the glass, taking care that it is not so  
wet as to run down in streams; in fact,  
the paper must only be completely moist­  
ened, or dampened, all through. Let it  
rest a few minutes, then go over the  
glass with a fresh newspaper, ti 1 it looks  
clear and bright. The insides of win­  
dows may be cleaned in the same way;  
also spectacle glasses, lamp glasses, etc.  
White paper that has not been printed  
on is better; but in the absence of that a  
very old newspaper, on which the ink  
has become thoroughly dried, should be  
used. Writing paper will net answer.

eek Some authorities question whether  
Belknap can legally be impeached now that he is n¢  
onger in office; and Gen. Grant is much blamed for  
allowing him to resign so promptly, instead of sus-  
pending him for trial. Grant declares he was unawure  
of the extent of the crime, and has since ordered the  
Attorney General to criminally prosecute General  
Belknap, and ail others concerned in the affair. One  
Captain Robinson declares that he laid all the facts  
about the Fort Sill contract before the President three  
years ago, with ample proofs, but Grant refused to do  
  
any thing about it. This may or may not be true

To Clean Looking Glasses.  
Take a newspaper, fold it small,  
dip it in a basin of cold water. When  
thoroughly wet squeeze it out as you  
would a sponge; then rub it over  
the surface of the glass, taking care  
that it is not so wet as to run down  
in streams; in fact the paper must  
only be completely moistened, or  
dampened all through. Let it rest a  
few minutes, then go over the glass  
with a fresh newspaper, till it looks  
clear and bright. The insides of  
windows may be cleaned in the same  
way, also spectacle glassess, lamp  
glasses, etc. White paper that has  
not been printed on is better; but in  
the absence of that a very old news­  
paper, on which the ink has bocome  
thoroughly dried should be used.

long as can be borne to a hot coal, or

s.   
What to Do in Case of Accidents.   
The following short rules for action,  
in cases of accident, will be found use­  
ful to remember. For dust in the eyes  
avoid rubbing—dash water in them; re­  
move cinders, etc., with the round  
point of a lead pencil. Remove wax  
from the ear with tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument in the ear. If  
any artery is cut compress above the  
wound; if a vein is cut, compress be­  
low. If choking, get on all fours and  
cough. For slight burns dip the parts  
in cold water—if the skin is destroyed,  
cover with a paste of whitening and  
water. Smother a fire with carpets,  
etc.: water will often spread burning  
oil and increase the danger. Before  
passing through smoke take a long  
breath and then stoop low; but, if car­  
bonic acid gas is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or,  
better still, cut out the part without  
delay; hold the wounded part as long  
as can be borne to a hot coal, or end of  
a lighted cigar. In case of poisoning  
excite vomiting by tickling the throat,  
or by warm water and mustard. For  
acid poisons give alkalies, for alkaline  
poisons give acids; white of egg is  
good in most cases; in case of opium  
poisoning give strong coffe and keep  
moving. If in water float on the back  
with nose and mouth projecting. For  
apoplexy, raise the head and body; for  
fainting, lay the person flat.   
Diffident Daughters.   
It is a painful spectacle in families  
where a mother is the drudge, to see  
the daughters, elegantly dressed, re­  
clining at their ease, with their draw­  
ing, their music, meir fancy work, and  
their reading, beguiling themselves of  
the lapse of hours, days and weeks,  
and never dreaming of their responsi­  
bilities, but, as a necessary consequence  
of neglect of duty, growing weary of  
their useless lives, laying hold of every  
newly invented stimulant to arouse  
their drooping energy, and blaming  
their fate, when they dare not blame  
their God,for having placed them where  
they are. These individuals will often  
tell you, with an air of affected com­  
passion—for who can believe it real?—  
that “poor mamma” is working herself  
to death; yet no sooner do you propose  
that they should assist her than they  
declare that she is quite in her ele­  
ment—in short,that she would never be  
happy if she had only half as  
much to do.

What to Do in Case of Accidents.  
The following short rules for action,  
in cases of accident, will be found uso  
ful to remember. For dust in the eyes  
avoid rubbing--dash water in them; re­  
move cinders, etc., with the round  
point of a lead pencil. Remove wax  
from the ear with tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument in the ear. If  
any artery is cut compress above the  
wound; if a vein is cut, compress be  
low. If choking, get on all fours and  
cough. For slight burns dip the parts  
in cold water--if the skin is destroyed,  
cover with a paste of whitening and  
water. Smother a fire with carpets,  
etc.; water will often spread burning  
oil and increase the danger. Before  
passing through smoke take a long  
breath and then stoop low; but, if ear­  
bonic acid gas is suspected, walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, pnless your  
mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or,  
better still, cut out the part without  
delay; hold the wounded part as long  
as can be borne to a hot coal, or end of  
a lighted cigar. In case of poisoning  
excite vom&#x27;ng by tickling the throat,  
or by warm water and mustard. For  
acid poisons give alkalies, for alkaline  
poisons give acids; white of egg is  
good in most cases; in case of opium  
poisoning give strong coffe and keep  
moving. If in water float on the back  
with nose and mouth projecting. For  
apoplexy, raise the head and body; for  
fainting, lay the person flat,  
Diffident Daughters,  
It is a painful spectacle in famflles  
where a mother is the drudge, to see  
the daughters, elegantly dressed, re­  
clining at their ease, with their draw­  
ing, their music, their rancy work, and  
their reading, beguiling themselves of  
the lapse of hours, days and weeks,  
and never dreaming of their responat­  
bilities, but, as a necessary consequence  
of neglect of duty, growing weacy of  
their useless lives, laying hold of every  
newly invented stimulant to arouse  
their drooping energy, and blaming  
their fate, when they dare not blame  
their God, for having placed them where  
they are. These individuals will often  
tell you, with an air of affected com­  
passion,-for who can believe it real?  
that &quot;poor mamma&quot; is working herself  
to death; yet no sooner do you propose  
that they should assist her than they  
declare that she is quite in her ele­  
ment--in short, that she would never be  
happy if she had only half as  
much to do.
