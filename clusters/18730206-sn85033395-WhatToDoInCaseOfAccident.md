**What to Do in Case of Accident.**  
  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University, gives these short rules for action in case of accident. It would not be a bad thing to cut them out and carry them in one&#x27;s pocketbook, or, better yet, commit them to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing; dash water in them, remove cinders, etc, with the round point of a lead pencil.   
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water—never put a hard instrument into the ear.  
  
If an artery is cut, compress above the wound; if a vein is cut, compress below.   
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
For slight burns, dip the part in cold water, if the skin is destroyed cover with varnish.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, etc,; water will spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before passing through smoke, take a full breath and then stoop low; but if carbon is suspected, walk erect.   
  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or, better, cut out the part without delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling the throat or by warm water and mustard.  
  
For acid poisons, give alkalies, for alkaline poisons, give acids—white of egg is good in most cases; in case of opium poisoning, give strong coffee, and keep moving.  
  
For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person flat.

WH AT TO 1M i ASK V ACCIDENT.  
Frof. Wilder, of Cornell University  
gives the following short rules for ac  
tion in case ot acccidcnt, which it will  
be found useful to preserve or remeni  
ber :  
For dust in the eye avoid rubbing  
dash water iuto them; remove cinder,  
etc., with the round point of a lead  
pencil.  
Remove water from the ear by tepid  
water; never put a hard instrument  
in the ear.  
If any artery is cut, compress above  
the wouud ; if a veiu is cut, compress  
below.  
If choking, get upon all fours and  
cough.  
For slight burns, dip the part in  
cold water ; if the skin is destroyed,  
cover with varnish.  
Smother a fire with carpets, &amp;c. ;  
water will spread burning oil, and in­  
crease danger. Before pushing through  
smoke take a full breath and than

RULES TO REMEMBER,  
  
If one only knows what to do in emergencies, he  
can bring comfort to many a sufferer, and save, per-  
haps, dying men. The following rules, by Prof.  
Wilder, of Cornell University, are worth committing  
to memory:  
  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing, and dash water  
into them; remove cinders, &amp;c., with the round point  
of a pencil.  
  
Remove insects from the ear by tepid water; never  
put a hard instrument into your ear.  
  
If any artery is cut, compress below.  
  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
  
Smother a fire with carpets, &amp;c.; w’ ‘-r will often  
spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before  
passing through smoke, take a full breath, and then  
stoop low; but if carbonic is suspected, walk erect.  
  
Suck poisoned wounds, or cut out the part without  
delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne  
toa hot coal or the end of a cigar.  
  
In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling  
the throat, or by warm mu: °  
  
For acid poisons give alkalies; for alkaline poisons  
give acids; white of an egg is good in most cases.

r heads and  
a corresponding portion of their backs were visi­  
ble ; only thus could they gain temporary relief  
from the myriads of flies and other insects that  
continually swarmed about them.  
The completion of the floating raft finished  
the labor of these intelligent beasts. At what­  
ever time in the day their task was over, their  
masters would allow them the remaining por­  
tion for themselves, and they wandered about  
at will, seeming to thoroughly enjoy their lib­

they had worked continuously for five days at  
their laborious taak.—Marlton Downing.  
WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.  
Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University, gives  
the following short rules for action in the case  
of accident, which it will be found useful to  
preserve or remember:  
For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing; dash wa­  
ter in them; remove cinders, etc., with the  
round point of a lead pencil.  
Remove matter from the ear with tepid wa­  
ter ; never put a hard instrument into the ear.  
If an artery is cut, compress above the wound;  
if a vein is cut compress Tbelow.  
If choked, get upon all fours and cough.  
For slight burns dip the part in cold water; if  
the skin is destroyed cover with varnish.  
Smother fire with carpets, etc., water will  
often spread burning oil and increase danger.  
Before passing through smoke take a full breath,  
and then stoop low; but if carbonic acid gas is  
suspected walk erect.  
Suck poisoned wounds, unless your mouth is  
sore; enlarge the wound, or, better, cut out  
the part without delay; hold the wounded part  
as long as can be borne to a hot coal or end of a  
cigar.  
In case of poisoning excite vomiting by tick­  
ling the throat or by warm water and mustard.
