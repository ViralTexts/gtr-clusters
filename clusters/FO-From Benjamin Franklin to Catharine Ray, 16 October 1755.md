Dear Katy  
Philadelphia Oct. 16. 1755  
Your Favour of the 28th of June came to hand but the 28th of September, just 3 Months after it was written. I had, two Weeks before, wrote you a long Chat, and sent it to the Care of your Brother Ward. I hear you are now in Boston, gay and lovely as usual. Let me give you some fatherly Advice. Kill no more Pigeons than you can eat. Be a good Girl, and don’t forget your Catechise. Go constantly to Meeting—or Church—till you get a good Husband; then stay at home, and nurse the Children, and live like a Christian. Spend your spare Hours, in sober Whisk, Prayers, or learning to cypher. You must practise Addition to your Husband’s Estate, by Industry and Frugality; Subtraction of all unnecessary Expences; Multiplication (I would gladly have taught you that myself, but you thought it was time enough, and wou’dn’t learn) he will soon make you a Mistress of it. As to Division, I say with Brother Paul, Let there be no Divisions among ye. But as your good Sister Hubbard (my Love to her) is well acquainted with The Rule of Two, I hope you will become as expert in the Rule of Three; that when I have again the Pleasure of seeing you, I may find you like my Grape Vine, surrounded with Clusters, plump, juicy, blushing, pretty little rogues, like their Mama. Adieu. The Bell rings, and I must go among the Grave ones, and talk Politicks. Your affectionate Friend

P.S. The Plums came safe, and were so sweet from the Cause you mention’d, that I could scarce taste the

catechism; go constantly to meeiing or to church  
till you get a good husband; and then stay at home  
and nurse the children, and live like a Christian.  
Spend your spare hours in sober whist, prayers, or  
learning to cipher.  
&quot;You must practice addition to your husband&#x27;s  
estate by industry and frugality,-substraction of all  
annecessary expences.Multiplication--he will  
soon make you master of. As to division, I say  
with brother Paul, &quot;Let there be no division among  
ye,&quot; but as your sister Hubbard (my love to her)  
is well acquainted with the rute of tao, I hope you  
will learn the rule of three, that when I have again  
the pleasure of seeing you, I may find you, like  
mny grape vine surrounded with clusters, plump,

and lovely as usual. Let me give you a  
piece of fatherly advice. Kill no more  
pigeons than you can eat; be a good girl  
and don&#x27;t forget your catechism; go con­  
stantly to meeting or to church till you get  
a good husband, and then stay at home and  
nurse the children and live like a Christian.  
Spend your spare hours in sober whist,  
prayers, or in learning to cypher.  
You must practice addition to your hus­  
band&#x27;s estate by industry and frugality?  
subtraction of all unnecessary expenses.?  
Multiplication?he will soon make you mas­  
ter of. As to division, I say, with brother  
Paul: &quot;Let there be no division among ye,&quot;  
but as your good sister Hubbard (my love  
to her) is well acquainted with the rule of  
two, I hope you will become as expert in  
the rule of three, and when I have again the  
pleasure of seeing you, I may find you, like  
my grape vine, surrounded by clusters of  
plump, juicy, blushing, pretty little rogues,  
just like their mamma. Adieu, the bell  
rings, and I must go among the grave ones  
and talk politics. b. f
