Philada. Oct. 25. 1750  
I ought to have inform’d you sooner that we got well home, and should have enquir’d after your Health as we left you in the Hands of a Fever; I beg you’d excuse the Delay, and desire you would remember in my favour the old Saying, They who have much Business must have much Pardon. Whenever Mr. Francis and I meet of an Evening, we drink your Health among our other New England Friends, and he desires to be always respectfully remember’d to you. I am glad to hear you are got well again, but cannot have the Pleasure of seeing you again this Year. I will write to Col. Schuyler, and obtain for you a particular Account of his manner of improving his Bank’d Grounds; and will also procure you a Specimen of our Alum Earth, with Mr. Syng’s Observations on it. In return (for you know there is no Trade without Returns) I request you to procure for me a particular Account of the manner of making a new kind of Fence we saw at Southhold on Long Island, which consists of a Bank and Hedge: I would know every Particular relating to this Matter, as, the best Thickness, Height, and Slope of the Bank; the Manner of erecting it; the best Time for the Work; the best Way of planting the Hedge; the Price of the Work to Labourers per Rod or Perch, and whatever may be of Use for our Information here, who begin in many Places to be at a Loss for Wood to make Fence with. We were told at Southhold that this kind of Fencing had been long practis’d with Success at Southhampton and other Places on the South Side of the Island, but was new among them. I heard the Minister of Southhold is esteem’d an ingenious Man; perhaps you may know him, and he will at your Request favour me with an explicit Account of these Fences.  
The fore part of the Summer here was extream dry, and the Grass in many Places was burnt up. But we had a good Crop of Wheat; and Rains coming on about the End of July we had in August a new Spring, the Grass sprouting again wonderfully thick and fast in Fields where we thought the very Roots had been destroy’d. Our Grave Diggers said they found the Earth hot sensibly at 3 Feet depth even after these Rains; perhaps the great Heat below and the Moisture above occasion’d this sudden and profuse Vegetation, the whole Country being as it were one great Hotbed.  
I am, with Esteem and Affection, Dear Sir Your obliged humble Servant  
B Franklin

Dear Sir,  
  
I ought to have informed you sooner that we got well  
home, and should have enquired after your health, as we  
left you in the hands of a fever. I beg you’d excuse the  
delay, and desire you would remember in my favour the old  
saying, they who have much business must have much pardon.  
Whenever Mr. Francis and I meet of an evening, we drink  
your health, among our other New-England friends, and he  
desires to be always respectfully remembered to you.—I am  
glad to hear you are got well again, but cannot have the  
pleasure of seeing you again this year. I will write to Col.

Schuyler, and obtain for you a particular account of his man-  
ner of improving his banked grounds ; and will also pro-  
cure you a specimen of our alum earth, with Mr. Syng’s ob-  
servations on it.. In return (for you know there is no trade  
without returns,) I request you to procure for me a particu-  
lar account of the manner of making a new kind of fence we  
saw at Southhold on Long-Island, which consists of a bank  
and hedge: I would know every particular relating to  
this matter, as, the best thickness, height, and slope of the  
bank; the manner of erecting it; the best time for the  
work ; the best way of planting the hedge ; the price of  
the work to labourers per rod or perch; and whatever may  
be of use for our information here, who begin in many pla-  
ces to be at a loss for wood to make fence with. We were  
told at Southhold that this kind of fencing had been long  
practiced with success at Southhampton and other places on  
the south side of the Island, but was new among them. I  
heard the minister of Southhold is esteemed an ingenious  
man ; perhaps you may know him, and he will at your re-  
quest, favour me with an explicit account of these fences.  
  
The fore part of the summer here was extremely dry, and  
the grass in many places was burnt up. But we had a good  
crop of wheat ; and rains coming on about the end of july,  
we had in Augusta new spring, the grass sprouting again  
wonderfully thick and fast in fields where we thought the  
very roots had been destroyed. Our grave-diggers said  
they found the earth hot sensibly at three feet depth, even  
after these rains. Perhaps the great heat below and the  
moisture above, occasioned this sudden and profuse,vegeta-  
tion, the whole country being as it were one great hot-bed.  
  
{ am, with esteem and affection, dear Sir,  
Your obliged humble servant,  
B. FRANKLIN.
