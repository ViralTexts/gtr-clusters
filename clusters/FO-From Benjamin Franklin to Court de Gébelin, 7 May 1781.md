The Compass appears to have been long known in China before it was known in Europe; unless we suppose it known to Homer, who makes the Prince, that lent Ships to Ulysses, boast that they had a spirit in them by whose Directions they could find their Way in a cloudy Day or the darkest Night. If any Phenicians arriv’d in America, I should rather think it was not by the Accident of a Storm, but in the Course of their long and adventurous Voyages; and that they coasted from Denmark and Norway over to Greenland, and down Southward by Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &amp;c. to New England, as the Danes themselves certainly did some Ages before Columbus.  
Our New American Society will be happy in the Correspondence you mention; and when it is

is certainly much reason to suppose that this con  
tinent had been visited by some of the Northern  
nations of Europe prior to the time of Columbus,  
and long before the revival of the subject by the  
Royal Danish Society, whose publications in rela­

dent of a storm, but in the course of their long  
and adrenturous voyages; and that they coasted
