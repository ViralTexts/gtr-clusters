FOUR GOOD HABITS.—There were four good habits a wise and good man earnestly recommended in his counsels and by his own example, and which he considered essentially necessary for the happy management of temporal concerns—these are punctuality, accuracy, steadiness, and despatch. Without the first, time is wasted, those who rely on us are irritated and disappointed, and nothing is done in its proper time and place. Without the second, mistakes the most hurtful to our own credit and interest, and that of others, may be committed. Without the third, nothing can be well done; and, without the fourth, opportunities of advantage are lost which it is impossible to recall.

 any calculations that may  
be made for the purpose of accounting  
for the strange aspect which the Irish  
census of this year will present. It  
should be then observed, &amp;nbsp; that the  
emigrants from Ireland generally are not  
the aged nor the very young, but persons  
whose removal would in a few years  
sensibly affect the natural increase of  
the population by the increase of births  
over deaths. The necessary consequence  
has been, that great numbers of those  
births which would have been registered  
in Ireland have been registered in the  
United States or the colonies, and many  
of them in this country. FOUR GOOD

The Connecticut Courant, daily and week­  
ly, has passed into new hands. The Cou­  
rant was established in 1764, consequently  
it ranks among the oldest newspapers in  
the country. Messrs. Hudson &amp; Goodwin  
published it for a long period, when it pass­  
ed into the hands of Mr. George Goodwin  
&amp; Sons, who were its publishers for many  
years. Mr. Boswell purchased it of the  
Messrs. Goodwins, and subsequently asso­  
ciated Mr. Faxon with him as a partner.—  
By the death of Mr. Boswell, the establish­  
ment was thrown into market, and was pur­  
chased by Mr. Thomas M. Day, son of  
Thomas Day, Esq., for the sum of $21,000.  
Mr. Day.assumed the management of the  
paper on the Ist inst. In making his edi­  
torial bow, he informs the public that he  
intends “to make a live paper of it”—that  
he shall “advocate a prohibitory liquor law.  
Earnestly and faithfully,” he says, “shall  
we contend for the total prohibition of all  
traffic in intoxicating liquors, except under  
regulations similar to those which now pre­  
vail, for mechanical, medicinal and sacra,  
mental purposes.” On other points Mr.  
Day assumes an equally independent posi­  
tion. We most cordially wish our new  
neighbor success in his enterprise.  
  
Four Good Habits.—There were four  
good habits which a wise and good man  
earnestly recommended in his counsels and  
by his own example, and which he con­  
sidered essentially necessary for the hap­  
py management of temporal concerns.—  
these are punctuality, accuracy, steadiness  
and dispatch. Without the first, time is  
wasted, those who rely on us are irritated  
and disappointed, and nothing is done inits  
proper time and place. Without the se­  
cond, mistakes the most hurtful to our  
credit and interest, and that of others,  
may be commited. Without the third, no­  
thing can be well done ; and without tho  
fourth, opportunity or advantage are lost  
which it is impossible to recall.

—The ConneeWtjjk  
Courant, daily and weekly, has passed  
new hands. The Courant was established  
in 1764, consequently it ranks among^the  
oldest newspapers in the country. Messrs.  
Hudson &amp; Goodwin published it for a long  
period, when it passed into the hands of Mr!  
George Goodwin &amp; Sons, who were its pub­  
lishers for many years. Mr. Boswell pur­  
chased it of the Messrs. Goodwins, and sub­  
sequently associated Mr. Faxon with him  
as a partner.—By the death of Mr. Boswell,  
the establishment was thrown into market,  
and was purchased by Mr. Thomas M. Day,  
son of Thomas Day, Esq., for the sum of  
$21,000. Mr. Day assumed the manage­  
ment of the paper on the lstinst. In making  
his editorial bow, he informs the public that  
he intends “to make a live paper of it”_  
that lie shall “ advocate a prohibitory liquor  
law. Earnestly and faithfully,” he says,  
“ shall we contend for the total prohibition  
of all traffic in intoxicating liquors, except  
under regulations similar to those which  
now prevail, for mechanical, medicinal and  
sacramental purposes.” On other points  
Mr. Day assumes an equally independent  
position. Wa most cordially wish our new  
neighbor sucsess in his enterprise.

The Best Righteousness..—If I had  
the righteousness of a saint, says one, oh,  
how happy I would be I If I had the  
righteousness of an angel, says another, I  
would fear no evil. But I am bold to say  
that the poorest sinner who believes in  
Christ has a righteousness more infinitely  
excellent than either saints or angels, ft  
the law requires an obedience that may  
stand before the burning eye of God,—  
behold! it is in Jesus, my Mediator.  
Should the strictest justice arraign me, I  
remit them both to my dying and obedient  
Immanuel. _ They who know Christ, will  
also put their trust in Him for sanctification  
of heart and newness of life. Though sin  
is rooted .in my soul, and rivetted in my  
constitution, yet Christ can purge it out.  
Though it were twisted with every nerve of  
my flesh, yet He can root it out, and Ml  
my heart with the pure love of God.—  
Brown.

GOOD ADVICE.  
Dr. Waugh lived to see his sons fixed  
in respectable stations in the world; it  
had been his objeot in preparing them for  
eternity, to qualify them also for honora­  
ble and useful conduct in the affairs of  
this life. lie inculcated that fear of God,  
that justice and benevolence, which are  
the rights and for the happiness of social  
life ; and taught them to be frugal, not  
mean ; prudent, not subtle ; complaisant,  
not servile ; *and active in business, but  
not its slaves. There were four habits  
which lie recommended earnestly in his  
ccrtfnsels” and by his own example, and  
which he stated to be essentially necessary  
to the happy management of temporal con­  
cerns ; these were punctuality, accuracy,  
steadiness and despatch. Without the  
first time is wasted, those who relied on  
us are irritated and disappointed, and noth­  
ing is done in its proper tune and place ;  
without the seconds mistakes the most  
hurtful to our awn credit and interest, or  
that of others, may be committed; with­

STOP THAT BOY.  
  
A cigar in his mouth, a swagger in his  
walk, impudence in his face, a care-o-  
nothingness in his manner. Judging from  
his demeanor he is older than his father,  
wiser than his teacher, more honored than  
the mayor of the town, higher than the  
president. Stop him ere tobacco shatters  
his nerves, ere pride ruins his character,  
ere the loafer masters the man, ere good  
ambition and manly strength give way to  
low pursuits and brutish aims. Stop all
