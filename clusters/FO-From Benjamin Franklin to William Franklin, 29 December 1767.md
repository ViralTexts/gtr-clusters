n and hurt by them, and how much the Grenvillians triumphed. I have just written a paper for next Tuesday’s Chronicle to extenuate matters a little.  
  
Mentioning Colonel Onslow, reminds me of something that passed at the beginning of this session in the house between him and Mr. Grenville. The latter had been raving against America, as traitorous, rebellious &amp;c. when the former, who has always been its firm friend, stood up and gravely said, that in reading the Roman history he found it was a custom among that wise and magnanimous people, whenever the senate was informed of any discontent in the provinces, to send two or three of their body into the discontented provinces to enquire into the grievances complained of and report to the senate that mild measures might be used to remedy what was amiss, before any severe steps were taken to enforce obedience. That this example he thought worthy our imitation in the present state of our colonies, for he did so far agree with the honourable gentleman that spoke just before him, as to allow there were great discontents among them. He should therefore beg leave to move that two or three members of parliament be appointed to go over to New England on this service. And that it might not be supposed he was for imposing burthens on others what he would not be willing to share himself, he did at the same time declare his own willingness if the house should think fit to appoint them, to go over thither with that honourable gentleman. Upon this there was a great laugh which continued sometime, and was rather increased by Mr. Grenville’s asking, “will the gentleman engage that I shall be safe there? Can I be assured that I shall be allowed to come back again to make the report?” As soon as the laugh was so far subsided as that Mr. Onslow could be heard again, he added, “I cannot absolutely engage for the honourable gentleman’s safe return, but if he goes thither upon this service I am strongly of opinion the event will contribute greatly to the future quiet of both countries.” On which the laugh was renewed and redoubled

Mentioning Col. Onslow reminds me of some­  
thing that passed at the beginning of this ses­  
sion in the House between him and Mr. Gren

plle ea he latter had been raving against  
America as traitorous, rebellious, &amp;c., when  
the former, who has always been its firm friend

Roman history he found it was a custom

content in the provinces to send two or three

inquire into the grievance complained of, and  
to report to the Senate that mild measures  
should be used to remedy what was amiss be­  
fore any severe stops were taken to enforce  
obedience; that this example he thought  
worthy of our imitation in the present state of  
our colonies, for he did so far agree with the  
honorable gentleman that spoke just before  
him as to allow there were great discontents  
among them. He should, therefore, beg leave  
to move that two or three members of Parlia­  
ment be appointed to go over to New England  
on this service, and, that it might not be sup­  
nosed he was for imposing, burdens on  
others which he would not be willing to  
bear himself, he would at the same time de­  
clare his own willingness, if the House should  
think fit to appoint him, to go over thither  
with that honorable gentleman. Upon this

so far subsided as that Mr. Onslow could be

engage for the honorable gentleman&#x27;s safe re­  
turn, butf he goes inahermpon this service  
am strongly of opinion the event will con­
