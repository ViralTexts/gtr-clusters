The Poughkeepsie Eagle, in an article on  
‘How mistakes happen in newspapers,”  
figures up the number of types used in a  
newspaper the size of the Eagle at 600,000,  
the actual number of bits of metal arranged

the type useless. It is very rarely thattype  
furnished by two different founderies can be  
used together, without a good deal of trou­

same standard.-  
We read once in a great while of a won­  
derful piece of cabinet work or mosaic work,  
containing ten, twenty, or fifty thousand  
pieces, the maker of which had spent  
months or even years of labor in producing  
  
it, and people go to see it as a great curios­

does not compare with that which the print­

put in wrong side up, or turned the wrong

—but if the printer, in fitting ten times as  
many pieces together in the same day, puts

THE MECHANISM OF A NEWSPAPER.  
‘The Poughkeepsie Eagle, in an article on  
‘‘How mistakes happen in newspapers,”’  
figures up the number of types used in a  
newspaper the size of the Fagle at 600,-  
000, the actual number of bits of metal  
arranged and re-arranged every day in  
preparing a newspaper the size of the  
Fagle for the press. We suppose few  
people think of the printing trade as the  
most exact and particular business but  
it is. In making type, variation that  
might be allowed in the machinery or  
the tinest watch would render the type  
useless. It is very rarely that type fur­  
nished by two separate foundries can be  
used together without a good deal or  
trouble, though they try to make it after  
the same standard. We read once in a  
while of a wonderful piece of cabinet  
work or mosaic work, containing ten,  
twenty or fifty thousand pieces, the mak­  
er of which bas spent months or even  
years of labor in producing it, and peo­  
ple go to see it as a great cariosity, but  
the most elaborate and carefully fitted  
piece of work of this kind ever made,  
does not compare with that which the  
printer does every day. The man who  
does the first is looked upon as an artist—  
a marvel of skill, and if a hundred of his  
pieces are put in wrong side up, or  
turned the wrong way, it is not observed  
in the general effect—but if the printer,  
in fitting ten times as many pieces to­  
gether in the same day, puts one where  
another should be, or turns one the

THE MECUHANISM OF A NEWSPAPER.  
The Poughkeepsie Eagle, in an article on  
‘How mistakes happen in newspapers,’figures  
up the number of types used in a newspaper  
the size of the Eagie at 600,000, the actual  
number of bits of metal arranged and re-ar­  
ranged every day in preparing a newspaper  
the size of the Eagle for the press. We su(r­  
pose few people think of the printing trade  
as the most exact and particular business,  
but it is. In making type, variations that  
might be allowed in the machinery of the  
finest watch would render the type useless.  
It is very rarely that type furnished by two  
separate foundries can be used together with­  
out a good deal of trouble, though they Vt;,  
and make it after the same standard. e  
read once in a while of a wonderful piece of  
cabinet work of mosaic work, containing  
ten, twenty or fifty thousand pieces, the  
maker of which has spent months or even  
years of labor in producing it, and people go  
to see it as a great curiosity, but the most  
elaborate and carefully fitted piece of work  
of this kind ever made, does not compare  
with that which the printer does every day.  
The man who does the first is looked upon  
as an artist—a marvel of skill, and if a hun­  
dred of his pieces are put in wrong side up,  
or turned the wrong way, it is not observed  
in the general effect—but if the printer, in  
fitting ten times as many pieces together in

‘be, or turns one the wrong way, everybody

Some idea of the elaborate workmanship

THE number of types used in an or­  
dinary country newspaper is about  
600,000; that is, the actual number of  
bits of metal arrangedfor each news­  
paper in preparing a. newspaper of  
that size for the press. We suppose  
few people think of the printing trade  
as one of the most exact and particu­  
lar handicrafts; but it is. In making

in the finest machinery -would render  
type useless. It is very rarely that  
type furnished by two separate found­  
ries can be used together without a  
great deal of trouble, even though  
they should try to make it after the  
standard. We read once in a while of  
a wonderful piece of cabinet or mosaic  
work containing ten, twenty or fifty  
thousand pieces, the maker of which  
has spent months, or even years, of  
labor in producing it; and people go  
to see it as a curiosity. But the most  
elaborate and careful piece of work of  
this kind ever made does not compare  
for minuteness of detail or accuracy  
of fitting with what the printer does  
every day. The man who does the  
first is looked upon as a marvel of  
skill, and if one hundred of his pieces  
are put in wrong side up or turned  
around, it is not noticed in the gener­  
al erTect; but if the printer in fitting  
ten times as many pieces together in  
a single day, puts one in the wrong  
way, everybody sees it, and is amazed  
at the &quot;stupid carelessness of the  
printers,&quot;
