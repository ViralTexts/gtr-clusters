ithstanding the intimations I had received, I could not believe that the solicitor-general would be permitted to wander from the question before their lordships, into a new case, the accusation of another person for another matter, not cognizable before them, who could not expect to be there so accused, and therefore could not be prepared for his defence. And yet all this happened, and in all probability was preconcerted; for all the courtiers were invited as to an entertainment, and there never was such an appearance of privy counsellors on any occasion, not less than thirty-five, besides an immense crowd of other auditors.  
The hearing began by reading my letter to Lord Dartmouth, enclosing the petition, then the petition itself, the resolves, and lastly the letters, the solicitor-general making no objections, nor asking any of the questions he had talked of at the preceding board. Our counsel then opened the matter, upon their general plan, and acquitted themselves very handsomely; only Mr. Dunning, having a disorder on his lungs that weakened his voice exceedingly, was not so perfectly heard as one could have wished. The solicitor-general then went into what he called a history of the province for the last ten years, and bestowed plenty of abuse upon it, mingled with encomium on the governours: But the favourite part of his discourse was levelled at your agent, who stood there the butt of his invective and ribaldry for near an hour, not a single lord adverting to the impropriety and indecency of treating a publick messenger in so ignominious a manner, who was present only as the person delivering your petition, with the consideration of which no part of his conduct had any concern. If he had done a wrong, in obtaining and transmitting the letters, that was not the tribunal where he was to be accused and tried: The cause was already before the chancellor. Not one of their lordships checked and recalled the orator to the business before them, but on the contrary (a very few excepted) they seemed to enjoy highly the entertainment, and frequently burst out in loud applauses. This part of his speech was thought so good, that they have since printed it in order to defame me every where, and particularly to destroy my reputation on your side the water, but the grosser parts of the abuse are omitted, appearing, I suppose in their own eyes, too foul to be seen on paper; so that the speech, compared to what it was, is now perfectly decent. I send you one of the copies. My friends advise me to write an answer, which I purpose immediately.

Their lordships’ report, which I send you, is dated the same day. It contains a severe censure, as you will see, on the petition and the petitioners; and, as I think, a very unfair conclusion from my silence, that the charge of surreptitiously obtaining the letters was a true one; though the solicitor, as appears in the printed speech, had acquainted them that that matter was before the chancellor; and my counsel had stated the impropriety of my answering there, to charges then trying in another court. In truth I came by them honourably, and my intention in sending them was virtuous, if an endeavour to lessen the breach between two states of the same empire be such, by showing that the injuries complained of by one of them did not proceed from the other, but from traitors among themselves.  
It may be supposed that I am very angry on this occasion, and therefore I did purpose to add no reflections of mine on the treatment the assembly and their agent have received, lest they should be thought the effects of resentment and a desire of exasperating. But indeed what I feel on my own account is half lost in what I feel for the publick. When I see that all petitions and complaints of grievances are so odious to government, that even the mere pipe which conveys them becomes obnoxious, I am at a loss to know how peace and union is to be maintained or restored between the different parts of the empire. Grievances cannot be redressed unless they are known; and they cannot be known but through complaints and petitions: If these are deemed affronts, and the messengers punished as offenders, who will henceforth send petitions? and who will deliver them? It has been thought a dangerous thing in any state to stop up the vent of griefs. Wise governments have therefore generally received petitions with some indulgence, even when but slightly founded. Those who think themselves injured by their rulers, are sometimes, by a mild and prudent answer, convinced of their errour. But where complaining is a crime, hope becomes despair.  
The day following I received a written notice from the secretary of the general post-office, that his majesty’s post-master general found it necessary to dismiss me from my office of deputy postmaster general in North America. The expression was well chosen, for in truth they were under a necessity of doing it; it was not their own inclination; they had no fault to find with my conduct in the office; they knew my merit in it, and that if it was now an office of value, it had become such chiefly through my care and good management; that it was worth nothing, when given to me; it would not then pay the salary allowed me, and unless it did, I was not to expect it; and that it now produces near £3000 a year clear to the treasury here: They had beside a personal regard for me. But as the post-offices in all the principal towns are growing daily more and more valuable by the increase of correspondence (the officers being paid commissions instead of salaries) the ministers seem to intend by directing me to be displaced on this occasion, to hold out to them all an example, that if they are not corrupted by their office to promote the measures of administration, though against the interest and rights of the colonies, they must not expect to be continued. This is the first act for extending the influence of government in this branch: But as orders have been some time since given to the American post-master general, who used to have the disposition of all places under them, not to fill vacancies of value, till notice of such vacancies had been sent hither, and instructions thereupon received from hence, it is plain that such influence is to be a part of the system, and probable that those vacancies will for the future be filled by officers from this country. How safe the correspondence of your Assembly-committees along the continent will be through the hands of such officers, may now be worth consideration, especially as the postoffice act of parliament, allows a post-master to open letters, if warranted so to do by the order of a secretary of state, and every provincial secretary may be deemed a secretary of state in his own province.

following remarks, respecting the petitions of  
  
1774. “When I see that all petitions and  
complaints of grievances are so odious to go-  
vernment, that even the mere pipe which con-  
veys them becomes obnoxious, I am at a loss  
to know how peace and union is to be main-  
tained or restored, between the different parts  
of the empire. Grievances cannot be redress-  
ed unless they are known; and they cannot be  
known but through complaints and petitions.  
Ifthese are doused atfivaie, an the messengers  
punished as offenders, who will henceforth send  
petitions? It has been thought a dangerous  
thing in any state, to stop up the vent of griefs.  
Wise governments have therefore generally re-  
ceived petitions with some indulgence, even  
when but slightly founded. ‘Those who think  
themselves injured by their rulers, are some-  
times, by a mild and prudent answer, convinced  
of their error. But where complainingisa crime,  
hope becomes despair.”

Solicitor-General would be permitted to  
wander from the question before their  
lordships into a new case, the accusation  
of another person for another matter, not  
cognizable before them, who could not

called a history of the province for the last

discourse was levelled at your agent, who  
stood there the butt of his invective ri-  
baldry for near an hour, not a single  
lord adverting to the impropriety and in-  
decency of treating a public messenger in  
so ignominious a manner, who was pre-  
sent only as the person delivering your  
petition, with the consideration of which  
no part of Ais conduct had any concern.

to interfere with his duty as agent to the  
colonies, and he felt the rejection of the  
petition more on their account than his  
own. “ What I feel on my own ac¬  
count,” he writes, ” is half lost in what  
I feel for the public. When I see that  
all petitions and complaints of griev¬  
ances are so odious to Government that  
even the mere pipe which conveys them  
becomes obnoxious, I am at a loss to  
know how peace and union are to be  
maintained or restored between the  
different parts of the empire.” And

I received a written notice from the secretary  
of the general post-office, that his Majesty’s post-  
master-general found it necessary to dismiss me  
from my office of deputy postmaster-general in  
North America. The expression was well chosen,  
for in truth they were under a necessity of doing  
it; it was not their own inclination; they had no  
fault to find with my conduct in the office; they  
knew my merit in it, and that if it was now an  
office of value it had become such chiefly through
