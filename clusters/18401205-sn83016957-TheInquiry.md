Tell me, ye winged winds,  
That rounds my pathway roar,  
Do ye know some spot  
Where mortals weep no more?  
Some lone and pleasant dell,  
Some valley in the west,  
Where, free from toil and pain,  
The weary soul may rest?  
The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,  
And sighed for pity as it answered &quot;No!&quot;  
  
Tell me, thou mighty deep,  
Whose billows round me play,  
Know&#x27;st thou some favored spot,  
Some island far away,  
Where weary man may find  
The bliss for which he sighs,  
Where sorrow never lives,  
And friendship never dies?  
The loud waves rolled in perpetual flow,  
Stopped for a while, and sighed, to answer &quot;No!&quot;  
  
And thou, serenest moon,  
That with such holy face,  
Dost look upon the earth  
Asleep in night&#x27;s embrace,  
Tell me, in all thy round,  
Has thou not seen some spot,  
Where miserable man,  
Might find a happier lot.  
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in wo,  
And a voice sweet, but sad, responded &quot;No!&quot;  
  
Tell me my secret soul,  
Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,  
Is there no resting place  
From sorrow sin and death;

Where weary man may find  
Tlie Miss for which he sighs,  
Where sorrow never lives  
And friendship never dies?  
The loud wuvi s, rolling in perpetual flow.  
Stopped for a while and sighed to answer, “No.”  
  
And thou, serenest moon,  
That with such lovely face  
Dost look upon the earth,  
Asleep in night&#x27;s embrace,  
Tell me, in all thy round  
Hast thou not seen some spot  
Where miserable man  
May find a happier lot?  
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe.  
And a voice, sweet but sad, responded, “No.**  
  
Toil me, my secret soul.  
Oh, tell me, Hope and Faith,  
Is there no resting place  
From sorrow, sin and death?  
Is there no happy spot  
Where mortals may be blest,  
Where grief may find a balm,  
And weariness a rest?  
Faith. Hope and Ix&gt;ve, best boons to mortals  
  
given,  
Waved their bright wings and whispered, &quot;Yes,  
in heaven.&quot; —Charles Mackay
