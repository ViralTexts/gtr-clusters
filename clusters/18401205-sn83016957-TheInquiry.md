Tell me, ye winged winds,

Stopped for a while, and sighed, to answer &quot;No!&quot;

Asleep in night&#x27;s embrace,

known but highly gifted poet. To all who may have any  
&quot;music in their souls,&quot; it must have a charm that can be felt

Some lone and pleasant dell,

The weary soul may rest!  
The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,

Tell me, thou mighty deep,

Know&#x27;st thou some favored spot,  
Some Island far away,  
Where weary man may find  
The bliss for which he sighs,  
Where sorrow never lies,  
And friendship never dies?  
The loud waves roaring in perpetual flow,  
Stopped for a while, and sighed to answer, &quot;No.&quot;  
And thou, serenest moon,

Doth look upon the earth

Where miserable man  
Might find a happier lot!  
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in wo,  
And a voice sweet, but sad, responded &quot;No.&quot;  
Tell me, my sacred soul,

THE INQUIRY.  
Tell me, ye winged winds  
That round my pathway roar,  
Do you not know some spot  
Where mortals weep no more ?  
Some lone and pleasant dell,  
Some valley in the west,  
Where, free from toil and pain,  
The weary are at rest?  
The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,  
And sighed for pity as it ans vered, “ no.”  
  
Tell me, thou mighty deep,  
Where billows round me play,  
Know’st thou not some favored spot,  
Some island far away,  
Where weary man may find  
The bliss for which he sighs,  
Where sorrow never lives  
And friendship never dies ?  
The loud waves rolling in perpetual flow,  
Stopped for a while and sighed to answer “ no,”  
  
And thou, serenest moon,  
That with such lovely face  
Dost look upon the earth,  
Asleep in night’s embrace,  
Tell me, in all thy rounds  
Hast thou not seen some spot  
Where miserableman 4 -~  
Might find a happier lot? &#x27;  
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe,  
And ina sweet voice, but sad, responded “ no.”  
  
Tell me, my secret soul,  
Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,  
Is there no resting place  
From sorrow, sin and death?  
Is there no happy spot  
Where mortals may be blessed,  
Where grief may find a balm  
And weariness a rest ?  
Faith, Hope, and Love, best boons to mortals  
iven,  
Waved their bright wings, and whispered “ yes,  
in Heaven.”

The poem which follows is said, by a corres­  
pondent, to have been written by Charles Mack­  
ey, sotne time editor of the Glasgow Argus, and  
to have appeared in a little volume called &quot;Voice  
from the Crowd.&quot; We remember reading it

Tell me ye winged winds,  
That round my pathway roar,  
Do ye not know some spot  
Where mortals weep no more?  
Some lone and pleasant dell,  
Some valley in the west,  
Where, free from toil and pain,  
The weary soul may rest?  
The loud winds softened to a whisper low,  
And sighed for pity, as it answered-&quot;No!&quot;  
Tell me tho might dee

Some island far away,  
Where weary man may find  
The bliss for which he sighs,  
Where sorrow never lives  
And friendship never dies?&quot;

Here then would I repose, majestic sea ;  
E&#x27;en now faint glimpses of eternity  
Come o&#x27;er me on the short-:  
My thoughts front thee to highest themes are given,  
As thy deep distant blue is lost in Heaven.  
SUNRISE COMES TO-MORROW.  
True it is that cloud and mist  
Blot the clear blue weather;  
True that lips that once have kissed,  
Come no more together.  
True that when we would do good,  
Evil often follow*;

My Sister&#x27;s Lover.  
The month of May, and through my  
half-epen window came stealing a soft  
wind, filled with summer warmth and  
summer fragrance. The trees in the  
garden were full of blossoms. The  
early roses were in bloom, but of ail  
this l saw nothing. My gaze was fixed  
upon two figures slowly walhing down  
the garden path—a man and a woman.  
The man was tall, and strong, and  
maderful, yet tender as a mother witli  
her first-born, gentle as a girl in all ihe  
little acts and courtesies of life. The  
woman was young and very beautiful,  
with a figure deader and swaying like  
a reed as she walked, and dark, lus­  
trous eyes, which brought to many a  
man his heart’s undoing.  
I fancied the light in them now, as  
she lifted them toGeoffry Biansoombe’s  
face. He was her guardian, and he loveed  
her. She was but my half-sister, five  
years my senior, and so I was not entitled  
to her confidence.
