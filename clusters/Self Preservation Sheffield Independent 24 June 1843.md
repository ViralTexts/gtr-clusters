SELF-PRESERVATION; a Popular Essay on those Concealed Disorders of the GENERATIVE SYSTEM, originating in certain solitary habits, youthful excesses, or infection, and terminating in Nervous Debility, Local or Constitutional Weakness, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis, Indigestion, Insanity, and Consumption. With practical Observations on MARRIAGE, and on the Anatomy, Physiology, and the Diseases of the Reproductive Organs, with plain directions for their perfect Restoration.  
  
By SAMUEL LAMERT, Consulting Surgeon, 9, Bedford-street, Bedford-square, London, and 21, Falkner Street, Manchester.  
  
Matriculated Member of the University of Edinburgh, Honorary Member of the London Hospital Medical Society, Licentiate of Apothecaries’ Hall, London, &amp;c.  
  
Publshed by the Author, and sold in London by S. Gilbert, 51 and 52, Paternoster row; Courier Office, 4, St. Anne’s Square, Manchester; Newton, Bookseller, Church street, Liverpool; Midgley, Halifax; Lawson, York; Buckton, Leeds; Review Office, Nottingham; Advertiser Office, Hull; Barraclough, 40, Fargate, Sheffield; and by all Booksellers.  
  
Reviews of the Work.  
  
“We consider this book really ought, as a matter of safety, be placed in the hands of every youth whose appearance indicates any tendency to Nervous Debility, or Premature Decay. Mr. LaMert, who is a regularly educated member of the Medical Profession, has treated the subject in a very scientific and intelligible manner, and we are certainly amazed at the prevalence and the consequences of those evils it is his province to pourtray and alleviate.” — Wakefield Journal  
  
“Mr. La’Mert’s Self-Preservation is an exceedingly valuable book for every young man into whose hands it may fall. If uncontaminated, its tones of friendly warning will serve to deter him from vice; if already its slave, the well marked, but not over-charged picture, will excite the well-founded and salutary fears of the sad consequences arising from secret indulgences.” — Bolton Free Press  
  
“The slow yet certain destruction of all the mental and bodily powers, arising from unrestrained excesses, are detailed in this talented book with a fearfully vivid reality. The slavery of the soul, the loss of all that can render life otherwise than a miserable existence, all this is told with truthful effect and earnest warning. It is well that the clue is furnished enabling the wanderer to retrace his steps from this moral labyrinth. Mr. LaMert’s qualifications for this task are confessedly of the highest order.” — Stockport Advertiser.  
  
“It is the production of an educated, thoughtful, and experienced practitioner, who has evidently devoted all his energies of his life to his peculiar study, that we hesitate not in removing completely from within the pale of those less systematic compilations. It os the best book extant upon the subjects on which it treats.” — Man. Chron.  
  
“The rapid and unprecedented sale of our large editions of this work, is the best test of public opinion in reference to the accuracy of its principles; and with a view to enhance its utility, the Author’s attention has been strongly directed to further the efforts in rendering it increasingly valuable. Long experience, in the treatment of a class of diseases hitherto neglected and most imperfectly understood by the great bulk of the medical profession, has enabled the writer to prove that there are concealed causes of indigestion, consumption, insanity, and Nervous Debility, in existence, where the mere routine practitioner would never dream of finding them; traceable to certain habits forming in the most secret, yet deadly, and fatal springs of domestic misery and premature mortality, the elements of social decline and national decay.” — Stafford Gazette.  
  
Mr. LaMert is to be consulted daily; and Country Patients, in their letters, are requested to be as minute as possible in the detail of their symptoms, age, general habits of living, and occupation in life. The communication must be accompanied by the usual Consultation Fee of £1, without which no notice whatever can be taken of their application; and in all cases the most involiable secrecy may be relied on.  
  
The Work may be had in Sheffield, at Mr. Barraclough’s, Bookseller, 40, Fargate, Sheffield, price 2s. 6d.
