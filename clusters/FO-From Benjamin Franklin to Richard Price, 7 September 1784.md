A chapter is devoted to that very interest-  
ing subject, the relation of Franklin to the  
French Revolution. He was a friend of Mira-  
beau, “the friend of man,” and in a letter to  
Price, in 1784, introduced the younger and  
greater Mirabeau, “who has prepared for the  
press a small piece, vastly admired by the  
best judges here, on the subject of hereditary  
nobility, which he proposes to get printed in  
England.” Malesherbes, Dupont de Nemours
