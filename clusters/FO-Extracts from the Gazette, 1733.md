Sunday Morning last, the Ice in Skuylkyl, tho’ prodigious thick and strong, broke up with a Fresh, and came down in Heaps, vast Cakes rouling over and over, in a terrible Manner, breaking great Trees where the Flood came over the low Land. Such a great Quantity of Ice being apt to damn [sic] the River in some Places, it rais’d the Water exceedingly, and drove with greater Violence when those Dams were broken. It carried away the Flats of two Ferries, and did other considerable Damage. The Water was near two Foot and a half high on the Ground Floor of Joseph Grey’s House at the middle Ferry; which is much higher than any Fresh is known to have b

The Week before last died here, after a short Illness, Mr. Joseph Norris, eldest Son of Isaac Norris, Esq; He was a young Gentleman of considerable Learning, yet a most facetious and agreeable Companion; and notwithstanding a polite Education, was a sincere Friend. His uncommon Good-Nature alone were sufficient to make his Death regretted by all that had the Pleasure of his Acquaintance. [October 18]

On Monday Evening last, Mr. Thomas Meakins fell off a Wharff into the Delaware, and before he could be taken out again, was drowned. He was an ancient Man, and formerly liv’d very well in this City, teaching a considerable School; but of late Years was reduc’d to extream Poverty. The following Lines were made by himself some time since.  
Some purchase Land, some stately Buildings raise,  
To memorize their Names to future Days;  
  
But I’ve a lasting Monument will stand,  
When Building’s fall, and Sales are made of Land:  
A certain Rock on Skuylkill’s eastern Side,  
Which bears my Name, for Ages will abide;  
This Rock, well-known, which Angler’s do frequent,  
When I am gone, will be my Monument.
