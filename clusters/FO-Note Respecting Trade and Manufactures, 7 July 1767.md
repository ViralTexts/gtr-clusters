This memorandum may have been intended as a newspaper article, although the editors have not discovered any printing of it in the London or Philadelphia papers. On the other hand, BF may have written it only for his own or his friends’ amusement. The manuscript is badly torn along its right side, so that many words are lost. The missing words have been supplied from William Temple Franklin’s printing of the document.
