Dear Friend,  
Passy July 26th.[—c. August 15] 1784.  
  
I have received several Letters from you lately, dated June 16th. June 30, &amp; July 13. I thank you for the Information respecting the Proceedings of your West India Merchants, or rather Planters: The Restraints whatever they may be upon our Commerce with your Islands, will prejudice their Inhabitants, I apprehend, more than us. It is wonderful how preposterously the Affairs of this World are managed. Naturally one would imagine that the Interest of a few Particulars, should give way to general Interest. But Particulars manage their Affairs with so much more Application, Industry and Address, than the Publick do theirs, that general Interest most commonly gives way to particular— We assemble Parliaments and Councils, to have the Benefit of their collected Wisdom, but we necessarily have at the same time the Inconvenience of their collected Passions, Prejudices &amp; private Interests. By the help of these, artful Men overpower the Wisdom, and dupe its Possessors; and if we may judge by the Acts, Arrets, &amp; Edicts all the World over for regulating Commerce, an Assembly of wise Men is the greatest Fool upon Earth.  
  
I have received Cook’s Voyages which you put Mr. Oswald in the way of sending to me. By some Mistake the first Volume was omitted, and instead of it a Duplicate sent of the third. If there is a good Print of Cook, I should be glad to have it, being personally acquainted with him. I thank you for the Pamphlets by Mr. Estlin. Every thing you send me gives me Pleasure, to receive your

not yet heard from Mr. Nairne—  
Dr. Price’s Pamphlet of Advice to America, is a good one, and will do Good. You ask “what Remedy I have for the growing Luxury of my Country, which gives so much Offence to all English Travellers—without Exception.” I answer that I think it exaggerated, and that Travellers are no good Judges whether our Luxury is growing or diminishing. Our People are hospitable, and have indeed too much Pride in displaying upon their Tables before Strangers the Plenty and Variety that our Country affords. They have the Vanity too of sometimes borrowing one another’s Plate to entertain more splendidly— Strangers being invited from House to House, and meeting every Day with a Feast, imagine what they see is the ordinary Way of living of all the Families where they dine; when perhaps each Family lives a Week after upon the Remains of the Dinner given. It is, I own, a Folly in our People to give such Offence to English Travellers. The first part of the Proverb is thereby verified, That Fools make Feasts. I wish in this Case the other were as true, and wise Men eat them. These Travellers might one would think find some Fault they could more decently reproach us with, than that of our excessive Civility to them as Strangers.  
I have not indeed yet thought of a Remedy for Luxury. I am not sure that in a great State it is capable of a Remedy. Nor that  
  
the Evil is in itself always so great as it is represented. Suppose we include in the Definition of Luxury all unnecessary Expence, and then let us consider whether Laws to prevent such Expence are possible to be executed in a great Country; and whether if they could be executed, our People generally would be happier or even richer. Is not the Hope of one day being able to purchase and enjoy Luxuries a great Spur to Labour and Industry? May not Luxury therefore produce more than it consumes, if without such a Spur People would be as they are naturally enough inclined to be, lazy &amp; indolent? To this purpose I remember a Circumstance. The Skipper of a Shallop employed between Cape May and Philadelphia, had done us some small Service for which he refused Pay. My Wife understanding that he had a Daughter, sent her as a Present a new-fashioned Cap. Three Years After, this Skipper being at my House with an old Farmer of Cape May his Passenger, he mentioned the Cap and how much his Daughter had been pleased with it; but says he it proved a dear Cap to our Congregation— How so? When my Daughter appeared in it at Meeting, it was so much admired, that all the Girls resolved to get such Caps from Philadelphia; and my Wife and I computed that the whole could not have cost less than a hundred Pound. True says the Farmer, but you do not tell all the Story; I think the Cap was nevertheless an Advantage to us; for it was the first thing that put our Girls upon Knitting worsted Mittens for Sale at Philadelphia, that they might have wherewithal to buy Caps &amp; Ribbands there; and you know that that Industry has continued and is likely to continue and increase to a much greater Value, and answers better Purposes. Upon the whole I was more reconciled to this little Piece of Luxury; since not only the Girls were made happier by having fine Caps, but the Philadelphians by the Supply of warm Mittens.  
In our Commercial Towns upon the Seacoast, Fortunes will occasionally be made. Some of those who grow rich, will be prudent, live within Bounds, &amp; preserve what they have gained for their Posterity. Others fond of showing their Wealth, will be extravagant and ruin themselves. Laws cannot prevent this, and perhaps it is not always an Evil to the Publick. A Shilling spent idly by a Fool, may be picked up by a Wiser Person who  
  
knows better what to do with it. It is therefore not lost. A vain silly Fellow builds a fine House, furnishes it richly, lives in it expensively, and in a few years ruins himself; but the Masons, Carpenters, Smiths and other honest Tradesmen have been by his Employ assisted in maintaining and raising their Families, the Farmer has been paid for his Labour and encouraged, and the Estate is now in better Hands— In some Cases indeed certain Modes of Luxury may be a publick Evil in the same Manner as it is a Private one. If there be a Nation for Instance, that exports its Beef and Linnen to pay for its Importations of Claret and Porter, while a great Part of its People live upon Potatoes and wear no Shirts, wherein does it differ from the Sot who lets his Family starve and sells his Clothes to buy Drink? Our American Commerce is I confess a little in this way. We sell our Victuals to your Islands for Rum and Sugar; the Substantial Necessaries of Life for Superfluities. But we have Plenty and live well nevertheless; tho’ by being soberer we might be richer. By the by, here is just issued an Arret of Council, taking off all the

augmenting their Settlements of being able to supply the growing People of North America with the Sugar that may be wanted there. On the whole I guess England will get as little by the Commercial War She has begun with us as she did by the Military. But to return to Luxury.  
The vast Quantity of Forest Lands we yet have to clear and put in order for Cultivation, will for a long time keep the Body of our Nation laborious and frugal. Forming an Opinion of our People and their Manners by what is seen among the Inhabitants of the Seaports, is judging from an improper Sample. The People of the Trading Towns may be rich and luxurious, while the Country possesses all the Virtues that tend to private Happiness &amp; publick Prosperity. Those Towns are not much regarded by the Country. They are hardly considered as an essential Part of  
  
the States. And the Experience of the last War has shown, that their being in Possession of the Enemy, did not necessarily draw on the Subjection of the Country, which bravely continued to maintain its Freedom &amp; Independence notwithstanding—  
It has been computed by some Political Arithmetician, that if every Man and Woman would work four Hours each Day on something useful, that Labour would produce sufficient to procure all the Necessaries &amp; Comforts of Life, Want and Misery would be banished out of the World, and the rest of the 24 Hours might be Leisure and Pleasure.  
What occasions then so much Want &amp; Misery? It is the Employment of Men and Women in Works that produce neither the Necessaries nor Conveniences of Life, who, with those who do nothing, consume the Necessaries raised by the Laborious.— To explain this—  
The first Elements of Wealth are obtained by Labour from the Earth and Waters. I have Land and raise Corn. With this if I feed a Family that does nothing, my Corn will be consum’d and at the End of the Year I shall be no richer than I was at the Beginning. But if while I feed them I employ them, some in Spinning others in hewing Timber &amp; sawing Boards, others in making Bricks &amp;c. for Building; the Value of my Corn will be arrested, and remain with me, and at the End of the Year we may all be better clothed and better lodged. And if instead of employing a Man I feed, in making Bricks, I employ him in fiddling for me, the Corn he eats is gone, &amp; no Part of his Manufacture remains to augment the Wealth and the Conveniencies of the Family. I shall therefore be the poorer for this fiddling Man, unless the rest of My Family work more or eat less to make up for the Deficiency he occasions—  
  
Look round the World and see the Millions employ’d in doing nothing, or in something that amounts to nothing when the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life are in Question. What is the Bulk of Commerce, for which we fight and destroy each other but the Toil of Millions for Superfluities to the great Hazard and Loss of many Lives by the constant Dangers of the Sea. How much Labour Spent in Building and Fitting great Ships to go to China and Arabia for Tea and for Coffee, to the West Indies for Sugar, to America for Tobacco! These Things cannot be called the Necessaries of Life, for our Ancestors lived very comfortably without them.  
A Question may be asked, Could all these People now employed in raising, making or carrying Superfluities, be subsisted by raising Necessaries? I think they might. The World is large, and a great Part of it still uncultivated. Many hundred Millions of Acres in Asia, Africa &amp; America, are still Forest, and a great Deal even in Europe. On 100 Acres of this Forest a Man might become a substantial Farmer; and 100,000 Men employed in clearing each his 100 Acres, (instead of being as they are French Hairdressers) would hardly brighten a Spot big enough to be Visible from the Moon, unless with Herschell’s Telescope, so vast are the Regions still in [the] World unimproved.  
’Tis however some Comfort to reflect that upon the whole the Quantity of Industry and Prudence among Mankind exceeds the Quantity of Idleness and Folly. Hence the Increase of good Buildings, Farms cultivated, and populous Cities filled with Wealth all over Europe, which a few Ages since were only to be found on the Coasts of the Mediterranean: And this notwithstanding the mad Wars continually raging, by which are often destroyed in one Year the Works of many Years Peace. So that we may hope the Luxury of a few Merchants on the Sea Coast, will not be the Ruin of America.  
One Reflection more, and I will end this long rambling Letter.— Almost all the Parts of our Bodies require some Expence. The Feet demand Shoes, the Legs Stockings, the rest of the Body Clothing, and the Belly a good deal of Victuals. Our Eyes, tho’ exceedingly useful, ask when reasonable, only the cheap Assistance of Spectacles, which could not much impair our Finances. But The Eyes of other People are the Eyes that  
  
ruin us. If all but myself were blind, I should want neither fine Clothes, fine Houses nor Fine Furniture.  
Adieu, my Dear Friend. I am Yours eve

I have not indeed yet thought of a  
remedy for luxury. I am not (ure,  
that in a great ftate it is capable of a  
remedy ; nor that the evil is initfelf al-  
ways fo great as it is reprefented. Sup-  
pofe, we include in the definition of  
luxury, all unneceflary expenie, and then  
let us confider whether laws, to prevent  
fuch expenfe, are poffible to be exceuted  
in a great country; and whether, if  
they could be executed, the people would  
be happier, or even richer? Is not the  
hope of being, one day, able to pur-  
chafe and enjoy luxuries, a great {pur  
to labour and induitry ? May net Jux-  
ury, therefore, produce more than it  
confumes, it, without fuch a {pur, peo-  
ple would be, as they are naturaily e-  
nough inclined to be, lazy and indolent ?  
To this purpoie I remember a circum-  
ftance. ‘The tkipper of a thallop, em-  
ployed between Cape May and Phila-  
delphia, had done us fome finall fervice,  
for which he refused payment. My wiic,  
underftanding that he had a daughter,  
fent her, asaprefent, a new-fafhioned  
cap. Three years after, this tkipper  
being at my houfe, with an old farmer  
ef Cape May, his paflenger, he men-  
tioned the cap, and how much his  
daughter had been pleated with it;  
** but,” fays he, “ it proved a dear cap  
to our congregation.” —** How fo ?°—  
** Whien my « daughter ap peared in it at  
meeting, it was jo much adimired, that  
all the girls reiolved to get fuch caps  
from Philadelphia; and my wife and I  
eomputed that ihe whole could not have  
  
+e THR POLITICIAN.  
  
t Wht rw  
{ January,  
  
  
  
coft lefs than an hundred pounds.”&quot;—  
“‘ True,” fays the farmer, * but you  
do not tell all the ftory : I think the cap  
was neverthelefs an advantage to us 55 for  
it was the firftthing that put our girls  
upon knitting wor {ted mittens for “fale  
at Philadelphia, that they might have  
wherewithal to \buy caps and ribands  
there ; and you know that that indui-  
try has continued, and is likely to cons  
tinue and increafe to a much greater va-  
lue, and anfwers better purpetes.”—  
  
Uye the whole, I was more reconciled  
to this little piece of luxury, fince, not  
only the girls were made happier by  
having fine caps, but the Philadelphians,  
by the fupply of warm mittens.  
  
In our commercial towns, upon the  
fea coait, fortunes wll occationaily be  
made. Some of thofe who grow richy  
will be pru lent, hive within bounds,  
and preierve what they have gained, for  
their pofterity. Others, fond of thew.  
ing their wealth, will be extravagant,  
and ruin themfelves. Laws caanot pre-  
vent this: and perhaps it is not always  
an evil to the public. A fhilling {pent  
idly by a fool, may be picked up by a  
wiler perion, who knows better what te  
do with it. It is therefore not loft. &amp;  
vain filly fellow builis a fine houe,  
furnithes it richly, lives im it expenfives  
ly, and in a few years ruins himtelf ;  
but the mafons, carpenters, fimiths,  
and other honeft tradefinen, have been  
by his employ affifed in maintain-  
ing and railing their families; the far.  
mer has been paid for his labour, and en-  
couraged ; and the eftate is now in b etter  
hands. In fome caigs, indeed, certaia  
modes of luxury may be a pul slic evil,  
in the fame manner as it is a priv: ite  
one. If there be a nation, for inftance,  
that exports its beer and linen, to pay  
tor iis importation of claret and porter,  
while a great part of its people live upom  
potatoes, and wear no fhirts; wherein  
does it differ from the, fot who lets  
his family ftarve, and fells his clothes  
to buy drink ? Our American com-  
merce isy I contefs, a little in this way.

The vat quantity of forett lands we  
have yet to clear and put in order for  
cultivation, will, for a iong time, keep  
the body of our nation labcrious and fru-  
yal. Form ing an opinion of our people  
and their manners by what is feen among  
the inhabicants of the fea ports, is judg.  
ing trom an improper fample. ‘The peo-  
ple of the trauing towns may be rich and  
Juxurious, while the country pollefles  
all the virtues that tend to promcte hap-  
pinefs and public profperiity. Thofe  
towns are not much regarded by the  
country ; they are hardly confidered as  
an eflential part of the ftates; and the  
experience of the laft war has fhewn,  
that their being in poffeffion of the ene-  
my, did not neceffarily draw on the fub-  
jection of the country, which bravely  
continued to maintain its freedom and  
ludependence, notwithftanding.  
  
Ii has been computed, by fome pcli-  
tical arithmetician, that if every man and  
woman would work four hours each day  
on fomething ufetul, that labour would  
produce fufficient to procure all the ne-  
ceilaries and comforts of life ; want and  
mifery would be banithed out of the  
world; and the reft of the twenty-four  
hours might be leifure and pleaiure.  
  
What occafions then fo much wantand  
milery ? It is the employment of men  
and women in works that produce neither  
the neceflaries nor conveniences of life,  
who, with thofe who do nothing, con-  
fume the neceflaries raifed by the | labo-  
rious. ‘Toexplain this :  
  
The firft elements of wealth are ob-  
tained by labour, from thé earth and  
waters. I have land, and raife corn.  
Withthis, if I teed a family that does  
nothing, my corn will be contumed, and  
at the end of the year, I thall be no rich-  
er than I was atthe beginning. But  
if, while I feed them, I employ them,  
fome in fpinning, others in hewing tim-  
ber and fawing boards, others in mak-  
ing bricks, &amp;c. for building, the va-  
jue of my corn will be arrefted, and re-  
main with me, and at the end of the

T is wonderful how prepofter-  
oufly the affairs of this world  
are managed. Naturally one would  
imagine, ‘that the intereft of a few  
individuals, should give way to ge-  
neral intereft. But individuals ma-  
nage their affairs with fo much  
more application, induftry and  
addrefs, than the public do theirs,  
that general intereft moft com-  
monly gives way to particular—  
We afiemble parliaments and  
councils, to have the benefit of  
their collected wifdom ; but we ne-  
ceflarily have, at the fame time, the  
inconvenience of their collected paf-  
fiens, prejudices, and private inter-  
efts. By the help of thefe, artful  
men overpower their wifdom, and  
dupe its pofleffors: and it we may  
judge by the acts, arrets and edicts,  
all the world over, tor regulating  
commerce, an aflembly of great  
men is the greateft tool upon  
earth.  
[ have not yet indeed thought of  
a remedy for luxury. I am not  
fure that in a great ftate it is capa-  
ble of a remedy ; nor that the evil  
is in itfelf always fo great as it is re-  
prefented. Suppoie we include in  
the definition of Juxury all unnecef-  
fary expence, and then let us con-  
lider whether laws to prevent fuch  
expence are pollible to be executed  
  
Dr. Franklin, in 1784.  
  
in a great country, and whether, if  
they could be executed, our people  
generally would be happier, or e-  
ven richer. Is not the hope of one  
day, being able to purchale and en-  
joy luxuries, a great {pur to labour  
and induftry?) May not luxury  
therefore produce more than it con-  
fumes, if without fuch a fpur, peo-  
ple would be, as they are naturally  
enough inclined to be, lazy and in-  
dolent? To this purpofe I remem-  
ber a circumftance. The fkipper  
of a fhallop, employed between  
Cape-May and Philadelphia, had  
done us fome {mall fervice, for  
which he refufed to be paid. My  
wite underftanding that he had a  
daughter, fent her a prefent of a  
new fafhioned cap. Three years  
after, this {kipper being at my houfe  
with an old farmer of Cape-May,  
his paflenger, he mentioned the cap,  
and how much his daughter had  
been pleafed with it; ** But (faid  
he) it proved a dear cap to our con-  
gregation”’ ““ How fo?”  
  
“When my daughter appeared  
with it at meeting, it was fo much  
admired, that all the girls refolved  
to get fuch caps from Philadelphia ;  
and my wife and I computed that  
the whole could not have coft lefs  
than an hundred pounds.”—‘* True,

fell all the ftory : I think the cap  
  
was neverthelels an advantage to  
  
us ; for it was the firft thing that  
put our girls upon knitting worfted  
mittens for fale at Philadelphia,  
  
that they might have wherewithal  
  
to buy caps and ribbons there : and  
  
you know that that induftry has  
continued, and is likely to continue  
and increafe to a much greater va-  
  
ue, and anfwer better purpofes.”  
  
— Upon the whole, I was more re-  
conciled to this little piece of luxu-  
ry, fimce not only the girls were  
made happier by having fine caps,  
but the Philadelphians by the fupply  
  
of warm mittens.  
  
In our commercial towns upon  
the fea coaft, fortunes will occation-  
ally be made. Some of thofe who  
grow rich will be prudent, live  
within bounds, and preferve what  
they have gained for their pofteri-  
ty. Others, fond of fhewing their  
wealth, will be extravagant, and  
ruin themfelves. Laws cannot pre-  
vent thissx—And perhaps it is not  
always an evil to the public.—A  
fhilling {pent idly by a fool, may be  
picked up by a wifer perion, who  
knows better what to do with it.  
It is therefore not loft.—A vain filly  
fellow builds a fine houfe, furnifhes  
it richly, lives in it expenfively, and  
in afew years ruins himfelf; but  
the mafons, carpenters, {miths,  
and other honeft tradefmen, have  
been by his employ affifted in main-  
taining and raifing their families ;  
the farmer has been paid for his la-  
bour, and encouraged, and the ef-  
tate is now in beiter hands—lIn  
fomie cafes, indeed, certain modes  
of luxury may be a public evil, in  
the fame manner as it is a private  
One. If there be a nation, for in-  
ftance, that exports its beef and  
  
linen to pay for the importation of  
  
claret and porter, while a great part  
  
of its people live upon potatoes,  
  
and wear no fhirts; wherein does it  
Unt. Asyt. Vol. V. No, 1.  
  
differ from the fot who lets his fa-  
  
mily ftarve, and (ells his clothes to  
  
buy drink? Our American com-  
merce is, I confefs, a little in this  
way. We fell our victuals to the  
  
iflands for rum and fugar ; the fub-  
  
ftantial neceffaries of life for fuper-  
fluities. But we have plenty, and  
live well neverthelefs; though by  
being foberer, we might be richer.

The vaft quantity of foreft land  
we have yet to clear and put in or-  
der for cultivation, will for a long  
  
time keep the body of our nation  
laborious and frugal. Forming an  
  
opinion of our people and their man-  
  
ners, by what is feen among the  
inhabitans of the fea-ports, is judg-  
ing from an improper fample. The  
people of the trading towns may be  
rich and luxurious, while the coun-  
try pofleffes all the virtues that tend  
to promote happinefs and public  
proiperity. Thole towns are not  
much regarded by the country ;  
they are hardly confidered as an ef-  
fential part of the ftates; and the  
experience of the laft war has  
fhewn, that their being in the pol-  
feffion of the enemy, did not necef-  
farily draw on the fubjection of the  
country, which bravely continued  
to maintain its freedom an: inde-  
pendence notwithftanding.  
  
It ‘has been computed, by fome  
political arithmetician, that if every  
man and woman would work for  
four hours each day, on fomething  
uleful, that labour would produce  
futticient to procure all the neceffa-  
ries and comforts of life; want and  
milery would be bavifhed out of the  
world, and the reft of the twenty-  
four hours might be leifure and  
pleafure.  
  
What occafions then fe much  
want and mifery? It is the employ-  
ment of men and women in works  
that produce neither the necefla-  
ries nor conveniences of life, who,  
withthole who do nothing, confuame  
  
E  
  
  
  
  
  
ee  
  
34 Obfervations on luxury,  
  
neceflaries raifed by the laborious.  
To explain this:  
  
The firft elements of wealth are  
obtained by labour, from the earth  
and waters. Ihave land and raife  
corn. With this, ifI feed a tami-  
ly that does nothing, my corn will  
be confumed, and at the end of the  
year I fhall be no richer than ] was  
a’ the beginning. But if, while lfeed  
them, 1 employ them, fome in fpin-  
ning, others in making bricks, &amp;c.  
for building, the value of n y corn  
will be arrefted, and remain with  
me, and at.the end of the year we  
may all be better cloathed and bet-  
ter lodged. And if inflead ot cm-  
ploying a man I feed, in making  
bricks, I employ him in fiddling for  
me, the corn he eats is gone, and  
no part of his manufacture remains  
to augment the wealth an¢ conve-  
nience of the family ; 1 fhall there-  
fore be the poorer for this fidaling  
man, unleis the reft of my family  
work more, or eat lefs, to make up  
the deficiency he occafions,  
  
Look reund the world, and fee  
the millions employed in doing no-  
thing, or in fomething that amounts  
to nothing, when the neceflaries  
and conveniences of life are in quei-  
tion. What is the bulk of com-  
merce, for which we fight and de-  
ftroy each other, but the roi) of mil-  
lions tor fuperfluities, to the great  
hazard and lofs of many lives by the  
couftant dengers of the fea? How  
much labour is {pent in building and  
fitting great fhips to goto China and  
Arabi., for tea and coffee, to the  
Weit- Indies tor fugar, to America  
for ye The: c things Canlot  
be called the neceflaries ot life, for  
our ancettors lived very comlorta-  
bly with« ur them.  
  
A qucltion may be afked, could  
alt thefe people now RES in  
rauing, making, or carry ivy iuper-  
  
fiuines, be fubiilted by railing hes  
  
  
  
idlene/s,  
  
ceflaries? I think they might. The  
world is large, and a great part of  
ir ftill uncultivated. Many hundred  
millions of acres in Afia, Africa, and  
America, are ftill a foreft, anda  
great deal even in Europe. Ona  
huncred acres of this foreft a man  
might become a iubftantial farmer :  
and 100,000 men employed in clear-  
ing each his hundred acres, would  
hardly brighten a {pot big enough  
to be vifible from the moon, unlefs  
with Herfchell’s telefcope: fo vaft  
are the regions ftill in wood.  
  
It is however fome comfort to re-  
flect, that, upon the whole, the  
quantity of induft y and prudence  
among mankind exceeds the quan-  
tity of idlenefs and folly. Hence the  
increafe of good buildings, farms cul-  
tivated, and populous cities filled  
with wealth, all over Europe ;  
which a few ages fince, were only  
to be found on the coafts of the Me-  
diterranean; and this, notwith-  
{tanding the mad wars continually  
raging, by which are often deftroy-  
ed in one year the works of many  
years peace. So that we may hope  
the luxury of a few merchants on  
the coaft, will not be the ruin of A-  
merica,  
  
One refleftion more, and I will  
end this long rambling letter. Al-  
moft all the parts of our bodies re-  
quire fome expence. The feet de-  
mand fhoes ; the legs ftockings ; the  
reft of the body cloathing ; and the  
belly a good deal of victuals. Our  
eyes, though exceedingly uleful, afk,  
when realonable, only the cheap  
afliftance of tpectacles, which could  
not much impair eur finances. But  
the eyes of other peuple are the eyes  
that ruin ws. If all but myfelf were  
blind, I fhould want neither fine  
clothes, fine houfes, nor fine furnie  
ture.  
  
and indufiry.

Upon the whole, I was more reconciled

The vaft quantity of foreft land wc  
have yet to clear and pu» in order for cul¬  
tivation, will for a long time keep the  
body of our nation laborious and frugal.  
Forming an opinion of our people and  
their manners, by what is feen among the  
inhabitants ot the fea-ports, is judging  
friMU an improper famole. The people  
of the trading towns may be rich and  
luxurious, w’liile the country poflelfes all  
the virtues that lend to promote happiiufs  
and public profperity. Thofe towns arc  
not much regarded by the country ; they  
are tiardly confidcred as an »IVcntial part  
ot the States ; and the txperienc* ot the  
lart war has ftiew-n, that their being m the  
poUinion ot the enemy did ntit rcceflTa-  
rily draw on the fnliji^tiim of the c&lt;’un-  
try, which biavely continued to main¬  
tain its freedom and independence iiot-  
w ithftanding.  
  
It has been computed, by fome politi¬  
cal .iritl.mctician, that if every man and  
woman would work for four hours each  
day on fomething uieful, that labour  
Would produce fuffic ent to procure all  
the necellaries and C4)mt4.rrs ot life ;  
want and n ifciy w&lt; uld be ban’thed cut  
of the world, and the rift ot the twenly-  
f(»lir hours n.ighi be It ifure and pleafnre.

Look  
  
June 1792. On Luxury, Idlencn,

millions f.nploved in d -ing nothing, or  
in fomcthiiig that amounts to nothing,  
when thr ntctifmirs and conveniencts of  
life arc in ejucrtion. What is the bulk of

ftroy each other, but the tiril of millions  
for fnperfl iitic!*, to the great hazird and  
lofsof mtny lives by the conftant riangers  
of the fea? How much labvtiir is fpent in  
building and fitting gre it lh:ps to go to  
China and Ar abia for tea and coffee, to  
the Weft Indies for lugar, to America  
for tobacco f Thefe things cannot be  
called the neceffiries of life, for our an-  
ceftors lived very comfortably without  
them.  
  
A queftion may be afkvd. Could all  
ihcfe people now employed in railing,  
making, or carrying fupe* fluiiies, be fub  
filled by nifing necttfarics? I think they  
might. The world is large, and a great  
part of it is dill uncultivated. Many  
hundred millions of acres in Afia, Afri¬  
ca, ani! America, arc flilla forefl, and a  
great deal even in Kurope. i)n a hun¬  
dred acref of this foreft a man might be¬  
come a fubftantial farmer: and loo.ooo  
men employed in clearing each his him .  
dred acres, would hardly brighten a fpot  
big enough to be vilihle from the moot:,  
unlefs w ith Merfcheirs telefcope : fo vafl  
arc the regions dill in wood.  
  
It is, however, (ome comfort torifleifl,  
that upon the whole, the quantity ot in-  
dudry and prudence among mankind ex¬  
ceeds the quantity of idlenefs and lolly.  
Hence the increale of&#x27;good buildings,  
farms cultivated, and popiih&#x27;iis cities fil  
led with wealth, all over Europe ; which  
a few ages liiiee were ordy to be found  
on the coatts of the Mediterranean ; and  
this, not withd inding the mad w irs con¬  
tinually r.aging, by which are often I’e-  
droyed in one year the works of many  
yfat.&quot; peace. So that w’e may hope thi  
luxury of a few&#x27; merehants on the coaff  
will n»&lt;t be the ruin ot Amtriti.

flrli thing that put our giils upon knitting

Look round the world, and fee the mil¬

A quedion may be afkcd, Could all

they might. &#x27;J&#x27;he world is large, and a

It is, however, feme comfort to relief^  
that upon the whole, the quantity of in-

ceeds the quantity of idlencfs and folly4  
Hence the increafe ot good binldlrgs,

of .1 few merchants on the coalt will not  
be the ruin of America.

the inconvenience of their colle&amp;ed  
paflions, prejudices, and private  
intereftis. By the help of theie,  
artiful men overpower their wif-  
dom, and dupe its poffeifors: and  
if we may judge by the aéts, ar-  
rets and ediéts, all the world over,  
for regulating commerce, an aflem-  
bly of great men is the greateft  
fool upon earth.  
I have not yet indced thought of  
a remedy for luxury. I am not  
fure that in a great {tate it is capa-  
ble of a remedy, nor that the evil  
is in itfelf always fo great as it ts  
reprefented. Suppofe we include  
in the definition of Tusury all  
unneceffary expence, and then let  
us confider whether laws to pre-  
vent fuch expence are poffible to  
be executed in a great country;  
and whether, if they could be  
executed, our people gencrally  
would be happier, or even richer.  
Is not the hope of one day being  
able to purchafe and enjoy luxu-  
ries, a great {pur to labour and in-  
duftry? May not luxury therefore  
produce more than it confumes, if  
without fuch a fpur people would  
be, as they are naturally enough  
inclined to be, lazy and indolent ?  
To this purpofe 1 remember a cir-  
cumftance. The fkipper of a fhal-  
lop employed between Cape-May  
and Philadelphia had dove us fome  
fmall fervice, for which he refuted  
to be paid. My wife underftand-  
ing that he had a daughter, fent  
her a prefent of a new-fafhioned  
cap. Three years after, this fkip-  
er being at my houfe with‘an old  
cas of Cape-May, his paffenger,  
he mentioned the cap, and how  
much his daughter had been pleafed  
with it; “but (faid he) it proved  
a dear cap to our congregation,”—  
« How fo ?”—** When my daugh-  
ter appeared with it at Mecting,  
it was fo much admired, that all  
the girls refolved to get fuch caps  
from Philadelphia; and my wife  
and I computed that the whole  
  
could not have coft lefs than an  
hundred pounds.”&quot;—* True (faid  
the farmer) but you do not tell all  
the ftory: I think the cap was ne-  
verthelefs an advantage to us; for  
it was the firft thing that put our  
girls upon knitting worfted mittens  
for fale at Philadelphia, that they  
might have wherewithal to buy  
caps and ribbons there: and you  
know that that induftry has con-  
tinued, and is likely to continue  
and increafe to much greater value,  
and anfwer better purpofes.”—  
Upon the whole, I was more re-  
conciled to this little piece of  
luxury, fince not only the girls  
were made happier by having fine  
caps, but the Philadelphians by the  
fupply of warm mittens.  
  
In our commercial towns upon  
the fea-coaft, fortunes will occafi-  
onally be made. Some of thofe  
who grow rich will be prudent, live  
within bounds, and preferve what  
they have gained for their pofte-  
rity. Others, fond of fhewing  
their wealth, will be extravagant,  
and ruin themfelves. Laws ecan-  
not prevent this.—And perhaps it  
is not always an evil to the public.  
—A fhilling {pent idly by a fool  
may be picked up by a wifer per-  
fon, who knows better what to do  
with it. It is therefore not loit.—  
A vain filly fellow builds a fine  
houfe, furnifhes it richly, lives in  
it cxpentively, and in a few years  
ruins himfeif ; but the mafons, car-  
penters, {miths, and other honch  
tradcfmen, have been by his em~  
ploy affifted in maintaining and  
raifing their families; the farmer  
has been paid for his labour, arid  
encouraged, and the eftate is now  
in better hands.—In fome cafes,  
indeed, certain modes of luxury  
may be a public evil, in the fame  
manner as it isa privateonc. If  
there be a nation, for inftance, that  
exports its beef and linen to pay for  
the importation of claret and por-  
ter, while a great part of its

The vaft quantity of foreft land  
we have yet to clear and put in or-  
der for cultivation, will for a long  
time keep the body of our nation  
laborious and frugal. Forming an  
opinion of our people and their  
manners, by what is {een among  
the inhabitants of the fea-ports, is  
judging from an improper fample.  
The people of the trading towns  
may be rich and luxurious, while  
the country poffelfes all the virtues  
that tend to promote happinefs and  
public profperity. Thofe towns  
are not much regarded by the  
country; they ave hardly contider-  
ed as an effential part of the States;  
and the experience of the laft war  
has fhewn, that their being in the  
poffeifion of the enemy did not  
neceffarily draw on the fubjettion  
of the country, which bravely con-  
tinued to maintain its freedom and  
independence notwithftanding.  
  
It has been computed by fome  
political arithmetician, that if every  
man and woman would work for  
four hours each day on fomething  
ufeful, that labour would produce  
fufficient to procure all the necefla-  
ries and comforts of life ; want and  
mifery would be banifhed out of the  
world, and the reft of the twenty-  
four hours might be icifure and  
  
leafure.  
  
What occafions then fo much  
want and mifery? It is the cm-  
ployment of men and women in  
works that produce neither the ne-  
ceffarics nor conveniences of life,  
who, with thoic who do nothing,

confume the neceflaries raifed by the  
laborious. ‘To explain this:  
  
The firft elements of wealth are  
obtained, by labour, from the earth  
and waters, J have land and raife  
corn. With this if I feed a family  
that docs nothing, my corn will be  
confumed, and at the end of the  
year I fhall be no richer than [  
was at the beginning. But if,  
while I feed them, I employ them,  
fome in {pinning, others in making  
bricks, &amp;c. for building, the value  
of my corn will be arrefted, and  
remain with me; and at the end  
of the year we may all be better  
clothed and better lodged. And  
if inftead of employing a man I  
feed in making bricks, I employ  
him in fiddling for me, the corn  
he eats is gone, and no part of  
his manufacture remains to aug  
ment the wealth and convenience  
of the family ; I fhall therefore be  
the poorer for this fiddling man,  
unleis the reft of my family work  
morc, or eat lefs, to make up the  
deiiciency he occafions.  
  
Look round the world, and fee  
the millions employed in doing  
nothing, or in fomething that  
amounts to nothing, when the ne-  
ceflaries and conveniencies of life  
are in queftion, What is the bulk  
of commerce, for which we fight  
and deftroy each oher, but the toil  
of millions for fuperfluities, to the  
great hazard and lofs of many lives  
by the conftant dangers of the fea ?  
How much labour is {pent in build-  
ing and fitting great fhips to go to  
China and Arabia for tea and  
coffee, to the Weft Indies for  
fugar, to America for tobacco ?  
Thefe things cannot be called the  
neceifaries of life, for our anceftors  
lived very comfortably without  
thera,  
  
A queftion may be afked, Could  
all thefe people now cmployed in  
raifing, making, or carrying fuper-  
fluities, be fubfifted by raifing ne-

tioned the cap, and how much his  
daughter had been pleafed with it;  
«* but (faid he) it proved a dear cap

-—“ When my daaghter appeared

and my wife and I computed that the  
whole could not have coft lefs than

the farmer,) but you do not tell all

thelefs an advantage to us; for it was  
the firft thing that put our girls upon  
knitting wortted mittens for fale at  
Philadelphia, that they might have  
wherewithal to buy caps and ribbons

more reconciled to this little piece of  
luxury, fince not only the girls were  
made happier by having fine caps,  
but the Philadelphians by the fupply  
of warm mittens.  
In our commercial towns upon the  
fea-coait, fortunes will occafionally  
be made. Some of thole who grow  
rich will be prudent, live within  
bounds, and preferve what they have  
gained for their polterity. Others,  
fond of fhewing their wealth, will  
be extravagant, and ruin themfelves.  
Laws cannot prevent this. —And per-  
haps it is not always an evil to the  
public.—A fhilling {pent idly by a  
fool may be picked up by a wifer per-  
fon, who knows better what to do  
with it. It is therefore not loft.—  
A vaio filly fellow builds a fine houle,  
furnifhes it richly, lives in it expen-  
fively, and in a few years ruins him-  
felf; but the mafons, carpenters,  
{miths, and other honeft trade(men,  
have been by his employ affiited in  
maintaining and raifing their fami-

What oceafions then fo much want

of men and women in works that  
nraducé neither the necedlaries. nor  
conveniences of life, who, with thole  
who do nothing, confume the necef-  
fries raifed by the Jaborious. To  
explain this: :  
  
The firt elements of wealth are  
ébtained, by labour, from: the earth  
and waters. I have land and raife  
corn.. With this it I feed &amp; family  
that does nothing, my corn will be  
confumed, and at the end of the year,  
] fhall be no richer than T was at the  
beginnivig. But if, while feed them,  
LT employ them, fome in. pinning,  
others in making bricks, &amp;c. for  
builiing, the value of my cofn-will  
be arrelted, and remain with me;  
and at the end of the year we may  
al! be better clothed and better lodged.  
And ifinftead of employing a man I  
feed in making bricks, I employ him  
in fiddling for me, the corn he eats  
is gone, and no part of his manu-  
fifture remains to augment the  
wealth and convenience of the fami-  
ly; I thall therefore be the poorer for  
this fiddling man, unlefs the refit of  
my family work more, or eat lefs, to  
make up the deficiency he occafions.  
Pia round ihe world, and fee the  
huions employed in doing nothing,  
0; in ijomething that amounts to. go-  
thing, when the neceilaries and con-  
Weniences of life are in queltion.  
  
hat is the bulk of commerce, for

Trith fo much more application, in-  
dullry, and addrcfs, than the public  
do theirs, that general Interelt moil  
commonly gives way to particular.  
We aflemble parliaments and coun¬  
cils, to have the bepefit of their col¬  
lected wil&#x27;dom; but we neceflarily  
have, at the fame time, the inconve¬  
nience of their collected pafllons,  
prejudices, and private interelts. By  
the help of thefc, artful men over¬  
power their wifdom, and dupe its  
pofleflors: and if we may judge by  
the aCts, arrets, and edicts, all the  
world over, for regulating commerce,  
an aiTembly of great men is the grcat-  
elt fool upon the earth.  
  
I have not yet, indeed, thought of  
a remedy for luxury. I am not fure  
that in a great ftatc it is capable of a  
remedy; nor that the evil is in itfelf  
always fo great as it is reprefented.  
Suppofe we include in the definition  
of luxury all unneceifary expence,  
and then let us conlider whether laws  
to prevent fuch expencfe are poflible  
to be executed in a great country,  
and whether, if they could be execu¬  
ted, our people generally would be  
happier, or even richer. Is not the  
hope of being one day able to pur-  
chafe and enjoy luxuries, a great  
fpur to labour and indullry ? May  
not luxury, therefore, produce more  
than it confumes, if, without fuch a  
Ipur, people would be, as they are  
naturally enough inclined to be, lazy  
and Indolent ? To this purpefe I re¬  
member a circumllance. The (kip¬  
per of a (hallop, employed between  
Cape-May and Philadelphia, had  
done us fome fmall fervice, for which  
he refufed to be paid. My wife un-  
derilanding that he had a daughter,  
fent her a prefent of a new-falhioncd  
cap. Three years after, this Ikipper  
being at my houfe with an old far¬  
mer of Cape-May, his paffengcr, he  
mentioned the cap, and how much  
his daughter had been pleafed with  
it. “ But (faid he) it proved a  
  
‘‘ dear cap to our congregation.”—  
  
“ How fo ?”—“ When my daugh-  
“ ter appeared with it at meeting,  
  
“ it was fo much admired, that all  
“ the girls refolved to get fuch caps  
“ from Philadelphia j and my wife  
“ and I computed that the whole  
“ could not have coft lefs than a  
“ hundred pounds.”—“ True (faid  
‘‘ the farmer,) but you do not tell  
“ all the ftory. I think the cap was  
‘‘ neverthelefs an advantage to us;  
  
“ for it was the firft thing that put  
“ our girls upon knitting worlled  
“ mittens for fale at Philadelphia,  
  
“ that they might have wherewithal  
“ to buy caps and&#x27; ribbons there;  
  
“ and you know that that indullry  
‘‘ has continued, and is likely to con-  
“ tinue and increafe to a much great-  
“ er value, and anfvver better pur-  
“ pofes.”—Upon the whole, I was  
more reconciled to this little piece  
of luxury, fince not only the girls  
were made happier by having fine  
caps, but the Philadelphians by the  
fupply of warm mittens.  
  
In our commercial towns upon the  
fea-coall, fortunes will occafionally  
be made. Some of thofe who grow  
rich will be prudent, live within  
bounds, and preferve what they have  
gained for their poftcrity : others,  
fond of fire wing their wealth, wiU be  
extravagant, and ruin themfelvcs.  
Laws cannot prevent this: and per¬  
haps it is not always an evil to the  
public. A fliilling fpent idly by a  
fool, may be picked up by a wifer  
perfon, who knows better what to do  
with it. It is therefore not loft. A  
vain, filly fellow, builds a fine houfe,  
fumilhes h richly, lives in it exper-  
fively, and in a few years ruins him-  
felf: but the mafons, carpenters,  
fmiths, and other honeil tradefroeu,

tioned the cap, and how much his daughter had  
been pleased with it. “But” said lie “it proved a  
dear cap to our congregation.” “How so?” “When  
my daughter appeared withitat meeting, it -was so  
much admired, that all the girls resolved to get  
such caps from Philadelphia; and my wife and I  
computed, that the whole could not cost less than  
one hundred pounds.” “True (said the farmer)  
but you do not tell all tbe story. I think the cap  
was nevertheless an advantage to us, for it was the  
first thing that put our girls upon knitting worsted  
mittens for sale at Philadelphia, that they might  
have tLe wherewithal! to buy caps and ribands  
then, and you know, that industry has continued  
and is likely to continue and increase to a much  
greater value, and answer better purposes: — UpoD  
the whole, I was more reconciled to this little piece  
of luxury, since not only the girls were made hap-  
pier by having fine caps, but the Philadelphians by  
the supply of warm mittens.  
  
Io commercial towus, fortunes will occasionally  
be made. Some of those who grow rich will be pm- ■  
dent, live within bounds and preserve what they i  
have gained for posterity; others, fond of showing ;  
their wealth, will be extravagant and ruin them- j  
selves. Laws cannot prevent this: and perhaps it  
13 not always a public evil. A shilling spent idly 1  
by a fool may be picked up by a wiser person, who  
knows better what to do with it. It is therefore  
not lust to the community. A vain silly fellow  
builds a fine house, furnishes it richly, lives in it ex-  
pensively, and in a few years ruins hunself but the  
masons, carpenters, smiths and other honest trades-  
men, have been by his employ, assisted in main-  
taining and raising their families; the fanner has  
been paid for his labor and encouraged, and the es-  
tate has fallen into other bands. In some cases,&#x27;  
indeed, certain modes of luxury may be a public e-j  
vil, in tbe same manner that it is a private one. If j  
a nation exports its&#x27; beef and linnen, to pay for tbe j  
importation of claret and porter, while a great:  
  
| part of its people live on potatoes and wear no shirts, i  
wherein dues It differ from the sot, who lets bis fam- 1  
ily starve and sells his clothes to buy drink: Our  
  
commerce is I confess a little in this way. We sell  
our victuals to the islands for rum and sugar, the  
{substantial necessaries of life for superfluities. Butj  
we have plenty, and live well nevertheless, though  
by being sober wo might be much richer.

agine, that the interest ofa few individuals should  
give way to genera! interest; but individuals man-j  
ago their affairs with much more application, indus-j

general interest most commonly gives way to par-j

pable of a remedy, nor that the evil is in itself ai-j

expense, and then let us consider, whether laws to  
prevent such expense are possible to be executed,  
in a great country, and whether, if they could be 1

or cvea richer. Is not the hope ofbeing one day I

It is wonderful how preposterously the affairs of l *^&gt; ar ’ ^ hese things cannot be called neces*  
  
series of life, for our ancestors (and even some of us\
have lived very comfortably without them.  
  
A question may be asked, could all these people  
now employed in raising, making or transporting  
superfluities, be subsisted by raising necessaries?  
I tl ink they might. The world is large, and a great  
part of it still uncultivated— Many hundred millions  
acres of land in Asia, Africa and America, are still  
in forest, and a great deal even io Europe — On pne  
hundred acres of this forest a man might become a  
substantial farmer, and a hundred thousand men,  
in changing each his hundred acres, would hardly  
brighten a spot big enough to be visible from the  
moon unless with Herschel’s telescope; so vast are  
the regions still in wood.  
  
It is however some comfort to reflect, that upon  
the whole, the quantity of industry and prudence  
among mankind, exceeds the quantity of idleness  
and felly. Hence the increase of good buildings  
farms &#x27;cultivated, and populous cities filled with  
wealth; so that the luxury of the few, will not prove  
tbe ruin of the many.  
  
One more reflection and I am done. Almost all  
parts of our bodies require some expense. The  
feet demand shoes; the legs stockings; the rest of  
the body clothing and the belly a good deal of vie  
Inals. Our eyes, though exceedingly useful, ask,  
at no time more than the cheap assistance of spec-  
tacles, which would not much itnpairour finances;  
But it is the eyes of other people that ruin us. I

lt has been computed by some political  
arithmetician, that if every man or woman  
would work for four hours each day on some-  
  
_ thing useful, that labor would produce suffi-  
  
cient to procure all the necessaries and com-  
forts of his life, want and misery would be  
banished out of the world, and the rest of the  
twentyfour hours might be leisure and pleas-  
ure.  
  
What occasions then so much want and  
misery? It is the employment of men and  
women in works that produce neither the  
necessaries nor conveniences of life, who,  
with those who do nothing, consume neces-  
saries raised by the laborious. ‘To explain  
this,  
  
The first elements of wealth are obtained  
by labor, frosa the earth and waters. I have  
land, and can raise corn. With this, if I  
feed a family that does nothing, my corn will  
be consumed, so that at the end of the year  
I shall be no richer than I was at the begin-  
ning. But, if while I feed them, I employ  
them, some in spinning, others in making  
bricks, &amp;c. for building, the value of corn  
will be arrested, and remain with me, and at  
the end of the year we may all be better cloth-  
ed and better lodged.  
  
And if instead of employing a man I feed  
in making bricks, | employ him in fiddling  
for me, the corn he eats is gone and no part of  
his manufacture remains to augment the  
wealth and convenience of the family. Look  
round and see the millions employed in doing  
nothing, or something that amounts to noth-  
ing, when the necessaries and conveniences  
of life are in question.  
  
A question may be asked ; Could all these  
people now employed in raising, making, or  
carrying superfluities, be subsisted by raising  
necessaries? I think they might. The world  
is large and a great part uncultivated. Many  
hundred millions of acres in Asia, Africa,  
and America, are still in a forest, and a great  
deal even in Europe. On a hundred acres of  
this forest, a man might become a substantial  
farmer.

One reflection more, and I will end this  
long rambling letter. Almost all parts of our  
bodies require some expense. The feet de-  
mand shoes ; the legs stockings; the rest of  
the body clothing ; and the stomach a good  
deal of victuals. Our eyes, though exceed-  
ingly useful, ask, when reasonable, only the  
cheap assistance of spectacles which could  
not much impair our finances’ But the eyes  
of other people are the eyes that ruin us. If  
all but myself were blind, I should want  
neither fine clothes, fine houses, nor fine fur-  
niture. Franklin

Ir is wonderful how sprays the affairs of this world  
are managed. Naturally one would imagine, that the inte-  
rest of a few individuals should give way to general interest:  
but individuals manage their affairs with so much more appli  
cation, industry, and address, than the public do theirs, that  
  
eneral interest most commonly gives way to particular.  
We assemble parliaments and councils, to have the benefit  
of their collected wisdom; but we necessarily have, at the  
same time, the inconvenience of their collected passions, pre-  
judices, and private interests. By the help of these, artful  
men overpower their wisdom, and dupe its possessors;  
if we may judge by the acts, arrests, and edicts, all the world  
over, for regulating commerce, an assembly of great men is  
the greatest fool upon earth.  
  
I have not yet, indeed, thought of a remedy for luxury. I  
am not sure that in a great state it is capable of a remedy;  
nor that the evil is in itself always so great as is represented.  
Suppose we include the definition of luxury all unnecessary  
expense, and then let us consider whether laws to prevent  
such expense are possible to be executed in a great coun-  
try, and whether, if they could be executed, our people gene-  
rally would be gg or even richer. Is not the hope of  
being one day able to purchase and enjoy luxuries a great  
spur to labor and industry? May not luxury, therefore, pro-  
duce more than it consumes, if, without such a spur,  
would be, as they are naturally enough inclined to be, lazy  
and indolent. T’o this purpose I remember a circumstance.  
The skipper of a shallop, employed between  » May and  
Philadelphia, had done us some small service, for which he  
refused to be paid. My wife, understanding that he had @  
daughter, sent her a present of a new-fashioned cap. Three  
yeats after, this skipper being at my house with an old far-  
mer of Cape May, his passenger, he mentioned the cap,  
and how much his daughter had been pleased with it.

such caps from Philadelphia; and my wife and I computed  
that the whole could not have cost less than a hundred pounds.’  
— True (said the farmer), but you do not tell all the story. I  
think the cap was nevertheless an advantage to us ; for it was  
the first thing that put our girls upon knitting worsted mittens  
for sale at elphia, that they might have where-withal  
to buy caps and ribands there ; and you know that that in-  
dustry has continued, and is likely to continue and increase  
to a much greater value, and answer better purposes.’—  
Upon the whole, I was more reconciled to this little piece of lux-  
ury, since not only the girls were made happier by having fine  
, but the Philadelphians by the supply of warm mittens.  
n our commercial towns upon the sea-coast, fortunes will  
oceasionally be made. Some of those who grow rich, will be  
prudent, live within bounds, and preserve what they have  
gained for their posterity ; others, fond of showing their  
wealth, will be extravagant and ruin themselves. Laws can-  
not 7 this ; and perhaps it is not always an evil to the  
public. A shilling spent idly by a fool, may be picked up by  
a wiser person, who knows better what to do with it. we is  
therefore not lost. A vain, silly fellow builds a fine house, fur-  
nishes it richly, lives in it expensively, and in a few years  
ruins himself; but the masons, carpenters, smiths, and other  
honest tradesmen, have been by his employ assisted in main-  
taining and raising their families; the farmer has been paid  
for his labor, and encouraged, and the estate is now in better  
hands. In some cases, indeed, certain modes of luxury ma:  
be a public evil, in the same manner as it is a private one. if  
there be a nation, for instance, that exports its beef and linen,  
to pay for the importation of claret and porter, while a great  
part of its people live upon potatoes, and wear no shirts ;  
wherein does it differ from the sot, who lets his family starve,  
and sells his clothes to buy drink? Our American commerce  
is, I confess, a little in this way. We sell our victuals to the  
islands for rum and sugar ; the substantial necessaries of life  
for superfluities. But we have plenty, and live well neverthe-  
less; though by being soberer, we might be richer.

The vast quantity of forest land we have yet to clear, and  
put in order for cultivation, will for a long time keep the body  
of our nation laborious and frugal. Forming an cpimon of  
our people, and their manners, by what is seen among the in-  
habitants of the age, is judging from an improper sam-  
ple. The people of the trading towns may be rich and luxu-  
rious, while the — possesses all the virtues that tend to  
promote happiness and public prosperity. Those towns are  
not much regarded by the country ; they are hardly consider-  
ed as an essential part of the States; and the experience of  
the last war has shown, that their being in the possession of the  
enemy did not necessarily draw on the subjection of the coun-  
try; which bravely continued to maintain its freedom and in-  
  
ndence notwithstanding.  
__ it has been d by some political arithmetician, that  
if every man and woman would work for four hours each day  
on something useful, that labor would produce sufficient to  
procure all the necessaries and comforts of life; want and  
misery would be banished out of the world, and the rest of the  
twenty-four hours might be leisure and pleasure.  
  
What occasions then so much want and misery? It 1s the  
employment of men and women in works that produce neither  
the necessaries nor conveniences of life ; who, with those who  
do nothing, consume necessaries raised by the laborious. To  
explain this :  
  
he first elements of wealth are obtained by labor from the  
earth and waters. I have land, and raise corn. With this,  
if I feed a family that does nothing, my corn will be consum-  
ed, and at the end of the year I shall be no richer than I was  
at the beginning. But if, while I feed them, { employ them,  
some in spinning, others in making bricks, &amp;c. for building, the  
value of my corn will be arrested and remain with me, and at  
the end of the year we may all be better clothed and better  
dged. And if, instead of employing a man I feed in making  
bricks, I employ him in fiddling for me, the corn he eats is  
gone, and no part of his manufacture remains to augment the  
wealth and convenience of the family ; I shall, therefore, be  
so qa for this fiddling man, unless the rest of the family  
vork more, or eat less, to make up the deficiency he occa-  
  
  
  
sions,  
  
Look round the world, and see the millions ed in  
doing nothing, or in something that amounts Solin  
when the necessaries and conveniences of life are in question.  
What is the bulk of commerce, for which we fight and de-  
or each other, but the toil of miilions for superfluities,  
to the great hazard and loss of many lives, by the constant  
dangers of the sea? How much labor is spent in buildin  
and fitting great ships, to go to China and Arabia for tea  
Coffee, to the West Indies for sugar, to America for tobacco?  
These things cannot be called the necessaries of life, for our  
ancestors lived very comfortable without them.  
  
A question may be asked—Could all these people now  
employed in raising, making, or carrying superfluities, be  
subsisted by raising necessaries ? 1 think they might. The  
world is large, and a great part of it still uncultivated,  
Many hundred millions of acres in Asia, Africa, and Ame-  
rica, ure still in a forest; and a great deal even in Europe.  
On a hundred acres of this forest,a man might become a  
VoL, 1.—13  
  
  
  
substantial farmer; and a hundred thousand men a  
  
in clearing each his hundred acres, would hardly brighten a  
  
spot large enough to be visible from the moon, unless with  
erschel’s telescope ; so vast are the regions still in wood.  
  
It is, however, some comfort to reflect that, upon the  
whole, the quantity of industry and prudence amon kind  
exceeds the quantity of idleness and folly. Hence the in-  
crease of good buildings, farms cultivated, and populous cities  
filled with wealth, all over Europe, which a few ages since  
were only to be found on the coast of the Mediterranean : and  
this notwithstanding the mad wars continually raging, by  
which are often destroyed, in one year, the works of many  
years’ peace, Sothatwe may hope, the luxury of a few  
merchants on the coast will not be the ruin of America.  
  
One reflection more, and I will end this long rambling let-  
ter. Almost all the parts of our bodies require some expense.  
The feet demand shoes; the legs, stockings; the rest of  
the body, clothing; and the belly, a good deal of victuals.  
Our eyes, though exceeding useful, ask, when reasonable,  
only the cheap assi pectacles, which could not mucn  
impair our finances, But the eyes of other people are the  
eyes that ruinus. If all but myself were blind, I should  
want neither fine cloths, fine houses, nor fine furniture.

Dr. Franklin.—“The skipper of a shallop,”

daughter, sent her a pn nt of a new  
fashioned cap. Three years alter, this

Mow so ?—When my daughter appeared  
with it at meeting, it was so much admired,  
that all the gills resolved to get such caps

computed that the whole could not have

advantage to us; for it was the first thing  
that put our girls upon knitting worsted  
mittens for sale at Philadelphia, that they  
might have wherewithal to buy caps and

Passv, July -JB, 178-1. V  
Bear Friend—I have received several letters Irom 1  
you lately, dated June lb, June 30, and July 13. 1 j  
thank you lor the information respecting the pro- s  
cecdings of your West India merchants, or rather s  
planters. The restraints, whatever they may be, |  
upon our commerce with your islands, will prejudice c  
their inhabitants, I apprehend, more than us. It is c  
wonderful how preposterously the alfairs of this j  
world are managed. Naturally, one would imagine, r  
that the interests of a few particulars should give v  
way to general interest. Hut particulars manage |.  
their affairs with so much more application, industry, ]  
and addr, ss, than the public do theirs, that general  
interest most commonly gives way to particular. \\ e  
assemble parliaments and councils to have the bene­  
lit of their collected wisdom; hut we necessarily v  
have, at the same time, the inconvenience of their  
collected passions, prejudices, and private interests. c  
lly the help of these, artful men overpower tile wis­  
dom, and dupe its possessors; and, it we may judge   
by the acts, decrees, and edicts, all the world over,  
lor regulating commerce, an assembly ol wise men |.  
is the greatest fool upon earth. f  
Dr. Price&#x27;s pamphlet of Advice to America is a   
good one, and will do good. Von ask &quot;what remedy j  
1 have for the growing luxury of my country, which v  
gives so much 01/incc to all idnglieft travellers with- j  
out exception?&#x27;&#x27; 1 answer, that I think it exagger­  
ated, aud that travellers are no good judges, whether  
our luxury is growing or diminishing. Our people   
are hospitable, and have, indeed, too much pride in  
displaying upon their tables before strangers the  
plenty and variety that our country affords. They |  
have the vanity too of sometimes borrowing one an­  
other&#x27;s plate, to entertain more splendidly. Stran­  
gers, being invited from house to house, and meetinir j  
everyday with a feast, imagine what they see is the  
ordinarv way of living oi all the families where the)  
dine; when perhaps each tamil) lives a week alter j  
upon the remains of the dinner given. It is. I own.  
a folly in our people t&lt; give such offtnet to English  
truve&#x27;llers. The first part of the proverb is therein  
verified, that fools make feasts. luMi in tlii- ease  
the other were as true, and wist no n eat them.  
These travellers might, one would think, find some j  
fault they could more decently reproach us with,!  
than that of our excessive civility to them as stran­  
ger*. I  
1 have not, indeed, yet thought of a remedy for  
luxury: I am not sure that in a great state it is capa­  
ble of a remedy; nor that the evil i&gt;, in itsell, always  
so great as it is represented. Suppose we include (  
in the definition of luxury all unnecessary expense, (  
and then let us consider whether laws to prevent  
such expense are possible to be executed in a great  
country; and whether, if they could be executed,  
our people generally would he happier, or even  
richer, is not the hope ol one day being able to  
purchase and enjoy luxuries a great spur t&lt;&gt; labor and  
industry? May not luxury, therefore, produce more  
than if consumes, if, without such a spur, people  
would be, us they are naturally enough inclined to  
be, lazy awd indolent? To this purpose 1 remember  
a circumslauee. The skipper of a shallop, employ- (  
ed between Cape .May and Philadelphia, had done  
us some small service, for which he retused pay. My  
wife, understanding that lie had a daughter, sent her ,  
as a present a new-fashioned cap. Three years j  
after, this skipper being at my house with an old .  
farmer of Cape May, his passenger, he mentioned ]  
the cap, and how much his daughter had been pleas­  
ed with it; hut, said he. it proved a dear cap to our j  
congregation. How so? W hen my daughter appear­  
ed IU it at meeting, it was so much admired, that all  
the girls resolved to get such caps from Philadel- ,  
phi a; and my u ife aud 1 computed that the whole (  
could not have cost less than one hundred pounds. |  
True, said the farmer, but you do not tell all the  
story. 1 think the cap was nevertheless an advantage (  
to us; for it was the first thing that set our girls upon  
knitting worsted mittens for sale at Philadelphia,  
that they might have wherewithal to buy caps and  
ribands there; and you know that that industry has  
continued, and is likely to coutiuue and increase to a  
much greater value, and answer better purposes. &#x27; (  
b&#x27;pou the whole, 1 was more reconciled to this little  
piece of luxury, since not only the gills were made  
happier by having tine caps, but the Philadclphians  
by the supply of warm mittens.  
In our commercial towns upon the tea coast, for­  
tunes will occasionally be made. .Some of those who  
grow rich will be prudent, live within bounds, and  
preserve what they have gained for their posterity.  
Others, fond of showing their wealth, will be extra­  
vagant, and ruin themselves. Laws cannot prevent  
this, and perhaps it is not always an evil to the pub­  
lie. A shilling spent idly by a fool, may be picked  
up by a wiser person, who knows better what to do  
with it: it is, therefore, not lost. A vain, silly fel­  
low builds a tine house, furnishes it richly, lives in it  
expensively, and in a few years ruins himself; hut  
the masons, carpenters, smiths, aud other honest  
tradesmen, have been, by his employ, assisted in  
maintaining and raising their families: the farmer  
has been paid for his labor, and encouraged, and the  
estate is now in better hands. In some cases, in­  
deed, certain modes of luxury may be a public evil,  
in the same manner as it is a private one. It there  
be a nation, for instance, that exports its beef and  
linen to pay for its importations of claret and porter,  
while a great part of its people live upon potatoes, (  
and wear no shirt.-, wherein does it differ from the *  
sot, who lets his family starve, and sells his clothes  
to buy drink? Our American commerce is, 1 con­  
fess, a little in this way. We sell our victuals to  
your islands tor ruin aud sugar; the substantial tie- *  
cessaries of life for its superfluities. Hut we have *  
plenty, aud live well, nevertheless; though, by be­  
ing soberer, we might be richer.  
The vast quantity ot forest lands we have vet to  
clear and put iu order for cultivation, will for a long  
time keep the body of our nation laborious and fru- ,  
gal. Forming an opinion of our people aud their ,  
manners, by what is seen among the inhabitants of  
the seaports, is judging from an improper sample.  
The people of the trading towns may he rich and |  
luxurious, while the country possesses all the virtues &lt;  
that tend to private happiness and public prosperity, j  
Those towns arc not much regarded by the country; .  
they are hardly considered as an essential part ot  
these states. And the experience of the last war ,  
has shewn,that their being m possession of the one- ,  
my did not necessarily draw on the subjection of the |  
country, which bravely continued to maintain its (  
freedom and independence notwithstanding. j  
It lias been computed by some political arithmcti- J  
cian,lhat, if every man and woman would work four j  
hours each day in something useful, that labor would t  
produce sufficient to procure all the necessaries and  
comforts of life; want and misery would he banished \
out of the world, and the rest of the twenty-four .&lt;  
hours might be leisure and pleasure. i  
What then occasions so much want and misery.&#x27; .  
It is the employment of men and women in works }  
that produce neither the necessaries nor conveniences I  
of life; who, with those who do nothing, consume 1  
the necessaries raised by the laborious. To explain  
this—  
The first elements of wealth are obtained by labor J  
from the earth and waters. 1 have land, and raise I  
corn: with this I feed a family that does nothing: my &lt;  
corn will be consumed; and, at the end of the year, &#x27;  
1 shall be no richer than 1 was at the beginning. Hut t  
if, while 1 feed them, 1 employ them, some iu spin- -  
niiig, others in hewing timber and .-awing boards, ■&#x27;  
others in making bricks, &amp;c. for building, the value f  
of my corn will be arrested, and remain with me; s  
and, at the end of the year, we may all be belter i  
clothed and better lodged. And if, instead of em- t  
ploying a man I feed in making bricks, I employ 1 r  
liiu&#x27;i in fiddling for me, the corn he eats is gone, and i  
no part of his manufacture remains to augment the I  
wealth and the conveniences of the family. 1 shall t  
therefore he the poorer for this fiddling man, unless I  
the rest of my family work more or eat less to make  
up the deficiency he occasions. I  
Look round the world, aud see the millions ein- ,  
ployed in doing nothing, or in something that amounts  
to nothing, when the necessaries and conveniences t  
of life arc in question. What is the bulk of com- |  
mcrce, for which we fight and destroy each other,  
hut the toil of millions for superfluities, to the great  
hazard and loss of many lives by the constant dan­  
gers of the sea? How much labor spent in building  
and fitting great ships to go to China and Arabia for .  
tea and for coffee, to the West Indies for sugar, to j ,  
America for tobacco! These things cannot he called ,  
the necessaries of life, for our ancestors lived very ,  
comfortably without theui. 1  
A question may be asked: C ould all these people,  
now employed in raising, making, or carrying super­  
fluities, be subsisted bv raising necessaries? I think  
they might. The world is large, and a great part of I (  
it still uncultivated. Many hundred millions of acres  
in Asia, Africa, and America, are still forest, and a  
great deal even in Europe. On one hundred acres of  
this forest a nian might become a substantial fanner;  
and one hundred thousand men employed 111 clearing  
each his one hundred acres (instead ot being, as they ,  
are, French hair dressers,) would hardly brighten a |  
.pot big enough to he visible from the moon (unless , ,  
  
with llersclicll&#x27;s telescope,) so vast are the regions  
still in the world unimproved.  
&#x27;Tis however some comfort to reflect, that, upon  
the whole, the quantity of industry and prudence ,  
among mankind exceeds the quantity of idleness and  
folly. Hence the increase of good buildings, farms  
cultivated, and populous cities filled with wealth all  
over Europe, which, u few ages since, were only to  
be found on the coasts of the Mediterranean. And  
this, notwithstanding the mad wars continually  
raging, by which are often destroyed in one year  
the works of many years&#x27; peace. So that we may  
hope the luxury of a few merchants on the sea coast,  
will not be the ruin of America.  
One reflection more, aud I will end this long, ram­  
bling letter. Almost all parts of our bodies require  
some expense. The feet demand shoes, the legs  
stockings, the rest of the body clothing, and the bel­  
ly a good deal of victuals. Ovr eyes, though ex­  
ceedingly useful, ask, when reasonable, only the  
cheap assistance of spectacles, which could not much  
impair our finances. Hut THE EYES OK OTHER PEO­  
PLE are the eyes that ruin us. If all but myself  
were blind, I should want neither fine clothes, fine  
houses, nor fine furniture. Adieu, my dear friend.  
1 am yours ever

derive any personal advantage by saving it;  
and lastly, in Franklin’s own language:—  
“A shilling spent idly by a fool, may be  
picked up by a wiser person, who knows  
better what to do with it. It is therefore  
not lost. A vain, silly fellow builds a fine  
house, furnishes it richly, lives in it expen­  
sively, and in a few years ruins himself; but  
the masons, carpenters, smiths and other  
honest tradesmen have been, by his emplov,  
assisted in maintaining and raising their  
families; the farmer has been paid for his  
labor, and encouraged, and the estate is  
now in better hands.’’  
It is proper here to remark that what we  
consider a good quality in the character  
above mentioned, would not hold good in  
the person of one possessing a proper dis­  
crimination in the rightful use and appro­

substance of the story was, that the captain of a  
small craft running between Cape May and Phil-  
adelphia, had done a slight favor to Franklin&#x27;s  
family, for which he would receive no remunera-  
tion. Mrs. F. understanding that the captain  
hada young daughter, sent her as a present, a  
new fashioned cap. Some years after, the captain  
was at Franklin’s house, when, among other  
things, the cap was spoken of. It pleased his  
daughter greatly, but, he added, ‘it proved a  
dear cap for our whole congregation.”” The fact  
was, when the other girls saw the much admired  
cap, they sent to Philadelphia to get one for  
themselves, and he had computed that the whole  
number finally purchased could not have cost less  
than one hundred pounds. Upon this, an old  
farmer who was with the captain, insisted that it  
was, in the end, a benefit; inasmuch that it was  
the first thing that set the girls at Cape May  
knitting worsted mittens for sale in Philadelphia,  
so that they could have something wherewith to  
purchase their caps and ribbons. Moralizing  
upon this, Dr. Franklin was quite satisfied with  
the way in which the first luxury had turned out,  
since not only the girls were made happy by hav-  
ing fine caps, but the city folks by the supply of  
warm mittens.

humility and long suffering, are in very  
truth made &#x27;of the same stuff as the men,  
and are as prone to wrangle and let their  
angry passions rise as the brethren under

says, &quot;there is a haughtiness and fierceness

&quot;I have not et indeed thought ot  
remedy for luxury. I am not sure that  
in a great state it is capable of a remedy,  
nor that the evil is in itself always so great  
as it is represented. Suppose we incade  
in the definition ol luxury all unnecessary  
expense, and then let us consider whether  
laws to prevent sucli expense are possi  
hie to be executed in a great country,  
and whether, if they could be executed,  
our peorle generally would be happier or  
even richer. Is not the hope of being  
one dav aole to purchase and eniov lux  
nries a great spur to labor and iudustry?  
May not luxury, therefore, produce more  
than it consumes, it without such a spur  
people would be, as they are naturally  
enough inclined to be lazy and indolent.

WHAT ONE CAP DID.  
The Girls Wesa ~ ade Happy and an Ia­

Benjamin Franklin belonge I to an era in  
which political economy was practically  
unknown, and when there was a general  
disposition to exalt the home-made at the  
expense of the foreign and to decry all in­  
dolgence in luxuries. Yet he could not  
shut his eyes to an obvious fact that went  
to demonstrate the practical advantage of  
letting people judge of their own necessities  
and removing all obstacles to free exchange.  
Hie tells the following story:  
The skipper of a shallop, employed be­  
tween Cape May 5and Philadelphia, had  
done us some small service, for which he  
refused to be paid. My wife, understand­  
ing that he had a daughter, sent itor a pre­  
sent of a new-fashioned cap. Three years  
after, this skipper being at my house with  
an old farmer of Cape May, his passenger,  
he mentioned the cap, and how mnah his  
daughter had been pleased with it. &quot;But,&quot;  
said he, &quot;it proved a dear cap to our con­  
eregation.&quot; &quot;How so?&quot; &quot; When my  
daughter appeared with it at meeting it  
was so much admired that all the girls re­  
solved to get such caps from Philadelphia;  
and my wife and I computed that the  
whole could not have cost less than £100.&quot;  
&quot;True,&quot; said the farmer, &quot;but you do not  
tell all the story. I think the cap  
was nevertheless an advantage to us,  
for it was the first thing that  
put our girls upon knitting worsted  
mittens for sal nt PIhtladelphia,  
that they might hiav wherewithal to buy  
caps and ribbons; and you know that in -  
dustry has oontinued, and is likely to con -  
tinue and increase to a much areater value  
and answer better purposes.&quot; Upon the  
whole, 1 was more reconciled to this little  
piece of luxury, since not only the girls  
were made happier by having fine caps, but  
the Philadelphians by a supply of warm

I ?WRITTEN IN 17S4.  
I  
It is wonderful how preposterously  
the affairs of this world arc  
managed. Naturally one would imagine,  
that the interest of a few in&#x27;  
dividual* should give way to general  
interest; but individuals manage  
their affairs with so maeh more application,  
industry, and address, than  
the public do theirs, that general  
interest most commonly gives way to  
particular. We assemble parliaments  
and councils, to have the benefit  
of their collected wisdom ; but  
we necessarily have, at the same  
time, the inconvenience of their collected  
passions, prejudices, and private  
interests. l&gt;y the help of these,  
artful men overpower their wisdom,  
and dupe its possessors; and if we  
may judge by the acts, arrets, and  
edicts, all the world over, for regulating  
commerce, an assembly of great  
men is the greatest fool upon earth.  
1 have not yet, indeed, thought of  
a remedy for luxury. I am not sure  
that, in a great state, it is capable  
of a remedy; nor that tho evil is in  
itself always so great as is represent­  
  
ed. Suppose wc include in the definition  
of luxury all unnecessary expense,  
and then let us consider  
whether laws to prevent such expense  
arc possible to be executed in n great  
country, and whether, if they could  
be executed, our people generally  
would be happier, or even richer. Is  
not the hope of being one day able  
to purchase and enjoy luxuries, a  
great spur to labour and industry ?  
May not luxury, therefore, produce  
more than it consumes, if, without  
such a spur, people would bo, as they  
are naturally enough inclined to be,  
lazy and indolent? To this purpose  
1 I remember a circumstance. The  
&#x27; skipper of a shallop, employed between  
Cape May and Philadelphia,  
1 had done lis some small service, for  
which he refused to be paid. My  
1 wife understanding that he had a  
daughter, sent her a present of a new1  
fashioned cap. Three years after,  
this skipper being at my house with  
an old farmer of Cape May, his passenger,  
he mentioned the cap, and  
how much his daughter had been  
pleased with it. &quot;But (said he) it  
proved a dear cap to our congregation.&quot;?&quot;How  
so?&quot;?&quot;When my  
daughter appeared with it at meeting,  
it was so much admired, that, all the  
  
girls resolved to get such caps from  
Philadelphia; and my wife and I  
-computed that the whole could not  
have cost less than a hundred  
pounds.&quot;?&quot;True, (said the farmer)  
but you do not tell all the story. 1  
think the cap was nevertheless an  
advantage to us; for it wits the first  
thing that put our girls upon knitting  
worjitc&lt;f mittens for sale at Philadelphia,  
that they might have  
wherewith to buy caps and ribbons  
there; and you know that that industry  
has continued, and is likely  
to, continue and increase to a much  
greater value, and answer better purposes.&quot;?Upon  
the whole, I was  
more reconciled t&lt;&gt; this little piece of  
luxury, since not only the girls were  
madc?happier bv having line caps,  
. but the Philadclphians by the supply  
of warm mittens.  
Tn our commercial towns upon the  
seacoast, fortunes will be occasion&#x27;tilly  
made. Some of those who grow  
rich will be prudent, live within  
boupds. and preserve what they have  
gained for their posterity; others,  
fond of showing their wealth, will be  
extravagant, and ruin themselves,  
r Laws cannot prevent this ; and perhaps  
it is not always an evil to the  
public. A shilling spent idly by a  
fool, may he picked up by a wiser  
person, w ho know s better what to do  
. 1 I . . i / i i  
  
wiin it, it is tncretore not lost. A  
vain, silly fellow builds a fine house,  
furnishes it richly, lives in it expensively,  
and in a few years ruins himself;  
but the masons, carpenters,  
smiths, and other honest tradesmen  
have been, by his employ, assisted in  
maintaining and raising their families;  
the farmer has been paid for his  
labour, and encouraged, and the  
estate is now in better hands. In  
some eases, indeed, certain modes of  
luxury may bo a public evil, in the  
same manner as it is a private one.  
11&#x27; there be a nation for instance, that  
exports its beef and linen, to pay for  
the importation of claret and porter,  
while a great part of its pro} le live  
upon potatoes, and wear no shirts;  
wherein does it differ from the sot,  
who lets his family starve, and sells  
his clothes to buy drink&#x27;( Our  
American.commerce is, I confess,.&#x27;a  
little in tli is way. We sell our  
victuals to-^o islands Ibr rum and  
sugar; the substantial necessaries cf  
life for superfluities. Hut we have  
plenty, and live well nevertheless ;  
though, by being soberer, wo might  
be richer

The vast ounntitv of forest land  
  
1 %/ (  
we hiive vet to clear ana put in order  
fur cultivation. will for a long time  
keep tin* body of our nation laborious  
and frugal.?Forming an opinion  
&#x27;of our people, and their manners, by  
what i.&gt; seen among the inhabitants  
of the seaports, is judging from an  
improper sample. The people of the  
trading towns may l?e rich and luxurious,  
while the country possesses all  
the virtues that lend to promote hap 1  
puicss and public prosperity. Those j  
towns are liot much regarded by the j  
  
country ; they arc hardly considered  
lis an essential part of tl^ states ; and  
tlio experience of tho lasl war has  
shown, that their being in the possession  
of the enemy, did not necessarily  
draw on the subjection of the  
country ; which bravely continued to  
maintain its freedom and independence  
notwithstanding.  
I has been computed by some  
political arithiuutjeian, that if .every  
man aud woman would work for  
four hours each Hay on something  
useful, that labour would produce  
Sufficient to procure all the necessaries  
and comforts of life ; want and  
misery would be banished out of the  
worl&#x27;I, and the rest of the twentyfour  
hours miiiht be leisure and  
  
pleasure.  
What occasions then so much want  
and misery ? It is the employment  
of men and women in works that  
produce neither the necessaries nor  
conveniences of life; who, with  
those who do nothing, consume necessaries  
raised hy the laborious. To  
explain this:  
The first elements of wealth are  
obtained by laboiu1 from the earth  
and waters. 1 have land, and raise  
corn. With this, if I feed a family  
that does nothing, my corn will be  
consumed, and at the end of the year  
I shall he no richer than [ was at  
the beginning. But if, while I feed  
them, I employ them, some in spinning,  
others in making bricks, ?S;c:  
O1 ( O  
for building, the value of my corn  
o , y  
will be arrested and remain with me,  
and at the end of the year we all  
may be better clothed and better  
lodged. And if, instead of employing  
a man 1 feed in making bricks, 1  
employ him in fiddling for me, the  
corn he eats is gone, and no part of  
his manufacture lcmains to augment  
the wealth and convenience of the  
family; 1 shall, therefore, be the  
poorer for this fiddling man, unless  
the rest of my family work more, &lt;?r  
cat less, to make up the deficiency  
he occasions.  
Look round the world and see the  
  
millions employed in doing nothing,  
or something iliat amounts to nothing.  
when the necessaries and conveniences  
of life are in iptestion.  
V&gt; hat is the hulk of commerce, for  
which we light and destroy each  
other, hut the toil of millions for  
superfluities, to the great hazard and  
loss of many lives, hy the constant  
danger of the sea ? How much labour  
is spent in building and fitting great  
ships, to go to China and Arabia for  
tea and coffee, to the West Indies for  
sugar, to America for tobacco?  
These things cannot he called the  
necessaries of life, for otir ancestors  
lived very comfortably without them.  
A question may he asked?Could  
all these people now employed in  
raising, making, or carrying superfluities,  
he subsisted hy raising necessaries?  
I think they might. The  
world is large, and a great part of it  
still uncultivated. Many hundred  
millions of acres in Asia, Africa, and  
America, arc still in a forest; and a  
great deal even in Europe. On a  
hundred acres of this forest, a man  
might become a substantial farmer ;  
and a hundred thousand men employed  
in clearing each his hundred  
acres, would hardly brighten a spot  
large enough to be visible from the  
moon, unless with Jlcrsehel s telescope;  
so vast are the regions still  
in wood.  
It is, however, sonic comfort to  
reflect that, upon the whole, the  
quantity of industry and prudence  
  
among iii&lt;iukiii11 c.\cceus uiu ijuaiiiuy  
of idleness and folly. Hence the  
increase of good buildings, farms  
cultivated, and populous cities filled  
with wealth, all over Europe, which  
a few ages since were only to he  
found on the coast of the Mediterranean;  
and this notwithstanding  
the mad wars continually raging, by  
which are often destroyed, in one  
year, the works of many years&#x27; peace.  
So that we may hope, the luxury of  
a few merchants on the coast will not  
be the ruin of America.  
One reflection more, and 1 will end  
this long rambling letter. Almost  
all the parts of our bodies require  
some expense. The feet demand  
shoes ; the legs stockings : the rest  
of the body clothing ; and the belly a  
good deal of victuals. Our eyes,  
though exceedingly useful, ask when  
reasonable, ??nly the cheap assistance  
of spectacles, which could not much  
impair our finances, lfut the eyes  
of other people are the eyes that ruin  
us. If all hut myself wero blind, I  
should want neither fine clothes, fine  
houses, nor fine furniture.

## [EXTRACT FROM THE LIFE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/166116875)

FRANKLIN. It has been computed by some  
arithmetical politician that if every  
man and woman woula work 4 hours each  
day on something useful, that labour  
would procure all the comforts and  
necessaries of lift, want and misery  
would be banithed out of the world and  
the rest of the 24 hours might be given  
to leisure and pleasure. What occasions  
this 53 much want and misery ? It is the  
employment of men and women in works  
that rnoduce neither the necesmriM nor  
conveniences of life, and that these who  
do nothing consume the necessaries  
raised by the laborious -To explain this  
:— The first elements of life are  
obtained by labour from the earth and  
water*. I have &#x27;and and raise com, and  
with this if I feed a family that does  
nothing ; my com will be consumed and at  
tbe end of- the* year I shall be no  
richer than I was at the beginning at  
it, but if while I feed them I employ  
them — some in spinning, -others in  
making bricks etc, for building— the  
value of my corn will be raised and  
remain with me, and, at the end of the  
year, we may be all better off and  
belter lodged. And if, instead of  
employing a man in making bricks, I  
employ him in fiddling for me, the com  
he eats is gone and no part of his  
manufacture re mains to augment the  
wealth and convenience of the family ; I  
shall therefore be tlie poorer for this  
fiddling man, unless the rest «-l my  
family work more and eat less to make up  
tbe -deficiency he occasions. Look round  
and see the millions employed in doing  
nothing or in something tha( amounts to  
nothing wben the necessities and  
conveniences of life are in question.  
Wnat is thbulk of commerce for which -re  
fight and destroy each other but the  
toil of millions for supeifluities, to  
the great hazard and loss of many lives  
by the constant adventures of the sea.  
How much labour is spent in building and  
fitting great ships to go to China &#x27; and  
Arabia fur tea and coffee ; to the West  
Indies for sugar ; to America for  
tobacco ? These things cacnot be called  
the necessaries of life, tut uui  
wii^rawia iivca vcty cunuoriouiy wtioout  
them.The The question nay be asked:  
Could all these people now employed in  
raising, making or canjing superfluities  
be subsisted by raising necessaries? I  
think they m^ght. Tbe world is large and  
a great part of it is still  
uncultivated. Many hundred millions of  
acres in Asia, Africa and America are  
still in forest and a great deal even in  
Europe. On a hundred acres of this  
forest, a man might become a substantial  
farmer, and IC3.OCD men, each employed  
in clearing his hundred acres would  
hardly brighten a spot big enough to be  
visible from the moon, unless with  
Herschell&#x27;s telescope, so vast are the  
regions still in wood. It is, however,  
some comfort (o reflect that upon the  
whole the quantity of industry and  
piudence among mankind exceeds the  
idleness and folly. Hence the increase  
of good buildings, farms cultivated, and  
populous cities filled with wealth all  
over Europe, which a lew ages since were  
only to be found on the old continent ;  
and this, notwithstanding the mad waste  
continually raging, by which are  
destroyed in one year the works of many  
years&#x27; pains ; so that we may hope the  
luxury of the few people on the coast  
will not be the ruin cf America. One  
reflection more and I will end this long  
rambling letter. Almost all the parts of  
our bodies rcqn re some expense. The  
feet demand shots the legs stockings,  
the rest of the body clothing, and the  
belly a good deal of victuals. Our eyes,  
though exceedingly useful, may want  
reasonably enough the cheap assistance  
of spectacles, which could not much  
impair our finances. But the eyes of  
other people are the eyes that ruin us.  
If all but myself were blind, I should  
want neither fine clothes, fine houses  
nor fine furniture
