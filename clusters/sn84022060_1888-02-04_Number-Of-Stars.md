Some astronomers have devoted special attention to counting the number of stars which may be seen with the naked eye, and the result has been that, even to persons gifted with more than ordinary powers of vision, there are not so many as 4,000 stars at any time visible above the horizon. But a very different result presents itself when the heavens are surveyed through a telescope. Countless numbers of stars then come into view which were previously invisible, and the more powerful the telescope used the greater the number of stars revealed to observation, until finally the conclusion is arrived at that the number of stars visible in the heavens is limited only by the optical capacity of the instrument which the observer may employ in his survey. A familiar illustration of this is furnished by the well-known group of stars known as the Pleiades. Surveyed with the naked eye, this interesting object is seen to consist of only some six or seven stars; but when observed with an ordinary opera glass the entire field of view is filled with a beautiful congeries of distinct stars The great astronomer, Sir William Herschel, who far surpassed other astronomers in the profundity of his explorations of the stellar heavens, has left upon record some striking results of his observations illustrative of the immense multitude of stars which a powerful telescope is capable of revealing. It may be proper to remark that when the stars are surveyed even with a telescope of moderate capacity, they are seen traveling in quick succession through the field of view of the instrument, an optical illusion attributable to the diurnal revolution of the earth upon its axis.

NUMBER OF THE VISIBLE STARS.  
  
SOME astronomers have devoted special attention  
to counting the number of stars which may be seen  
with the naked eye, says Good Words, and the result  
has been that, even to persons gifted with more  
than ordinary powers of vision, there are not 80  
many as 4,000 stars at any time visible above the  
horizon. But a very different result presents itself  
when the heavens are surveyed through a telescope.  
Countless numbers of stars then come into view  
which were previously invisible, and the more  
powerful the telescope used the greater the number  
of stars revealed to observation, until finally the  
conclusion is arrived at that the number of stars  
visible in the heavens is limited only by the optical  
capacity of the instrument which the observer may  
employ in his survey. A familiar illustration of this  
is furnished by the well-known group of stars known  
as the Pleiades. Surveyed with the naked eye, this in-  
teresting object is seen to consist of only some six or  
seven stars; but when observed with an ordinary  
opera-glass the entire field of view is filled witha  
beautiful congeries of distinct stars. The great as-  
tronomer, Sir William Herschel, who far surpassed  
other astronomers in the profundity of his explora-  
tions of the stellar heavens, has left upon record  
some striking results of his observations illustratable  
of the immense multitude of stars which a powerful  
telescope is capable of revealing. It may be proper  
to remark that when the stars are surveyed even  
with a telescope of moderate capacity they seem  
traveling in quick succession through the field of  
view of the instrument, an optical illusion attribu-  
table to the diurnal revolution of the earth upon its  
axis. Herschel, while engaged in surveying some  
regions of the Milky Way, found that in the short  
interval of a quarter of an hour as many as 116,000  
stars passed through the field of his telescope. On  
another occasion he estimated that in forty-one min-  
utes there passed in review before him the immense  
number of 258,000 stars.

the optical capacity of the instrument  
which the observer may employ in his sur­  
vey. A familiarillustration of this isfur­  
nished by the well-known group of stars  
known as the Pleiades. Surveyed with  
the naked eye, this interesting object is  
seen to consist of only some six or seven  
stars; but when observed with an ordi­  
nary opera glass the entire field of view  
is filled with a beautiful congeries of dis­  
tinct stars The great astronomer, Sir  
William Herschel, who far surpassed  
other astronomers in the profundity of  
his explorations of the stellar heavens,has  
left upon record some striking results of  
his observations illustrative of the im­  
mense multitude of stars which a power­  
ful telescope is capable of revealing. It  
may be proper to remit, k that when the  
stars are surveyed even with a telescope  
of moderate capacity, they are seen trav­  
eling in quick succession through the field  
of view of the instrument, an optical il­  
lusion attributable to the diurnal revolu­  
tion of the earth upon its axis. Herschel,  
while engaged in surveying some region*  
of the Milky Way,found that in the short  
interval of a quarter of an hour as many  
as 116,000 star* passed through the field  
of hi* telescope. On another occasion he  
estimated that in 41 minutes there passed  
in review before him the immense number  
of 258,000 stars.
