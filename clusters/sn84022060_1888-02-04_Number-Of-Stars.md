NUMBER OF THE VISIBLE STARS.  
  
SOME astronomers have devoted special attention  
to counting the number of stars which may be seen  
with the naked eye, says Good Words, and the result  
has been that, even to persons gifted with more  
than ordinary powers of vision, there are not 80  
many as 4,000 stars at any time visible above the  
horizon. But a very different result presents itself  
when the heavens are surveyed through a telescope.  
Countless numbers of stars then come into view  
which were previously invisible, and the more  
powerful the telescope used the greater the number  
of stars revealed to observation, until finally the  
conclusion is arrived at that the number of stars  
visible in the heavens is limited only by the optical  
capacity of the instrument which the observer may  
employ in his survey. A familiar illustration of this  
is furnished by the well-known group of stars known  
as the Pleiades. Surveyed with the naked eye, this in-  
teresting object is seen to consist of only some six or  
seven stars; but when observed with an ordinary  
opera-glass the entire field of view is filled witha  
beautiful congeries of distinct stars. The great as-  
tronomer, Sir William Herschel, who far surpassed  
other astronomers in the profundity of his explora-  
tions of the stellar heavens, has left upon record  
some striking results of his observations illustratable  
of the immense multitude of stars which a powerful  
telescope is capable of revealing. It may be proper  
to remark that when the stars are surveyed even  
with a telescope of moderate capacity they seem  
traveling in quick succession through the field of  
view of the instrument, an optical illusion attribu-  
table to the diurnal revolution of the earth upon its  
axis. Herschel, while engaged in surveying some  
regions of the Milky Way, found that in the short  
interval of a quarter of an hour as many as 116,000  
stars passed through the field of his telescope. On  
another occasion he estimated that in forty-one min-  
utes there passed in review before him the immense  
number of 258,000 stars.

from the first day that ground was broken for  
this building to its completion ten years ago, no

“Tt is amusing to hear remarks of strangers

THE NUMBER OF STARS.  
  
A wRITER in Good Words remarks: ‘Some  
astronomers have devoted special attention to  
counting the number of stars which may be seen  
with the naked eye, and the result has been that,  
even to persons gifted with more than ordinary  
powers of vision, there are not so many as 4,000  
stars at any time visible above the horizon, But a  
different result presents itself when the heavens  
are surveyed through a telescope. Countless num-  
ber of stars then come into view which were pre-  
viously invisible, and the more powerful the tele-  
scope used the greater the number of stars revealed  
to observation, until at length the conclusion is  
arrived at that the number of stars visible in the  
heavens is limited only by the optical capacity of  
the instrument which the observer may employ in  
his survey. A familiar illustration of this is fur-  
nished by the well-known group of stars known as  
the Pleiades. Surveyed with the naked eye, this  
interesting object is seen to consist of only some  
six or seven stars; but when observed with an  
ordinary opera glass the entire field of view is  
filled with a beautiful congeries of distinct stars.

far surpassed other astronomers in the profundity  
of his explorations of the stellar heavens, has left

into view which were previously invisible,  
and the o ore powerful the telescope uses the  
greater the number of stars revealed to ob­

arrived at that the number of stars visible  
in the heavens is limited only by the optical  
capacity of the instrument which the obser­  
ver may employ in his survey. A familiar  
illustration of this is furnished by the well  
kr own group of stars known as the Pleiades  
Surveyed with the naked eye this interest­
