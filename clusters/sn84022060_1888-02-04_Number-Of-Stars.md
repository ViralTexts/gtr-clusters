From Good Words.  
Some astronomers have devoted special atten-­

be seen with the naked eye, and the result has  
been that, even to persone gifted with more than  
ordinary powers of vision, there are not so many  
as 4,000 stars at any time visible above the hori-­  
zon. But a very different result presents itself  
when the heavens are surveyed through a tele­  
scope. Countless numbers of stars then come into  
view which were previously invisible, and the  
 more powerful the telescope used the greater the  
number of stars revealed to observation, until  
finally the conclusion is arrived at that the num­  
ber of stars visible in the heavens is limited only  
by the optical capacity of the instrument which  
the observer may employ in his survey. A familiar  
illustration of this is furnished by the well-known  
group of stars known as the Plélades. Surveyed  
with the naked eye, this interesting object is  
seen to consist of only some six or seven stars;  
but when observed with an ordinary opera  
glass the entire field of view is filled  
with a beautifur congerles of distinct stars. The  
great astronomer, Sir William Herschel, who far  
surpassed other astronomers in the prorundity of  
his explorations of the stellar heavens, has left  
upon record some striking results of his observa.­  
tions illustrative of the immense multitude of  
stars which a powerful telescope is capable of re­  
vealing. It may be proper to remark that when  
the stars are surveyed even with a telescope of  
moderate capacity they are seen traveling in  
quick succession through the field of view of the  
ihstrument, an optical illusion attributable to the  
diurnal revolution of the earth upon its axis.  
Hierschel, while engaged in surveying some regions  
of the Mliky Way, found that in the short interval  
of a quarter of an hour as many as 116,000 stars  
passed through th fleld of his telescope. On an-­  
other occasion he estimated that in 41 minutes  
there passed in review before him the immense  
number of 258,000 stars.

ThE NuMbER OF THE STRrs.  
Some astronomers have devoted special  
attention to counting the number of stars  
which may be seen with the naked eye, and  
the result has been that, even to persons  
gifted with more than ordinary powers of  
vision, there are not so many as 4,000 stars  
at any time visible above the horizon. But  
a very different result presents itself when  
the heavens are surveyed through a tele­  
scope. Countless numbers of stars then  
come into view which were previously in­  
visible, and the more powerful the tele­  
scope used the greater the number of stars  
revealed to observation, until finally the  
conclusion is arrived at that the number of  
stars visible in the heavens is limited only  
by the optical capacity of the instrument  
which the observer may employ in his sur­  
vey. A familiar illustration of this is fur­  
nished by the well-known group of stars  
known as the Pleiades. Surveyed with the  
naked eye, this interesting object is seen to  
consist of only some six or seven stars;  
but when observed with an ordinary opera  
glass the entire field of view is filled with a  
beautiful congeries of distinct stars. The  
great astronomer, Sir William Herschel,  
who far surpassed other astronomers in the  
profundity of his explorations of the stel­  
lar heavens, has left upon record some  
striking results of his observations illustra­  
tive of the immense multitude of stars  
which a powerful telescope is capable of re­  
vealing. It may be proper to remark that  
when the stars are surveyed even with a  
telescope of moderate capacity they are  
seen traveling in quick succession through  
the field of view of the instrument, an op­  
tical illusion attributable to the dirunal rey.­  
olution of the earth upon its axis. Her­  
schel, while engaged in surveying some re­  
gions of the Milky Way, found that in the  
short interval of a quarter of an hour as  
many as 116,000 stars passed through the  
field of his telescope. On another oc­  
casion he estimated that in 41 minutes  
there passed in review before him the im­  
mense number of 258,000 stars.-Good  
WYords.

The Number of the Stars.  
[Good Words.]  
Some astronomers have devoted special  
attention to counting the number of  
stars which may be seen with the naked  
eye, and the resnlt has been that, even  
to persons gifted with more than ordin­  
ary powers of vision, there are not so  
many as 4,000 stars at any time visible  
above the horizon. But a very different  
result presents itself when the heavens  
are surveyed through a telescope. Count­  
less numbers of stars then come into view  
which were previously invisible, and the  
more powerful the telescope used the  
greater the number of stars revealed to  
observation, until fianlly the conclusion  
is arrived at that the number of star8
