Fine should be paid by the Sweeper; for it is his Fault.  
We have at present got Engines enough in the Town, but I question, whether in many Parts of the Town, Water enough can be had to keep them going for half an Hour together. It seems to me some Publick Pumps are wanting; but

As to our Conduct in the Affair of Extinguishing Fires, tho’ we do not want Hands or Good-will, yet we seem to want Order and Method, and therefore I believe I cannot do better than to offer for our Imitation, the Example of a City in a Neighbouring Province. There is, as I am well inform’d, a Club or Society of active Men belonging to each Fire Engine; whose Business is to attend all Fires with it whenever they happen; and to work it once a Quarter, and see it kept in order: Some of these are to handle the Firehooks, and others the Axes, which are always kept with the Engine; and for this Service they are consider’d in an Abatement or Exemption in the Taxes. In Time of Fire, they are commanded by Officers appointed by Law, called Firewards, who are distinguish’d by a Red Staff of five Feet long, headed with a Brass Flame of 6 Inches; And being Men of Prudence and Authority, they direct the opening and stripping of Roofs by the Ax-Men, the pulling down burning Timbers by the Hookmen, and the playing of the Engines, and command the making of Lanes, &amp;c. and they are impowered to require Assistance for the Removing of Goods out of Houses on fire or in Danger of Fire, and to appoint Guards for securing such Goods; and Disobedience, to these Officers in any, at such Times, is punished by a Fine of 40s. or Ten Days Imprisonment. These Officers, with the Men belonging to the Engine, at their Quarterly Meetings, discourse of Fires, of the Faults committed at some, the good Management in some Cases at others, and thus communicating their Thoughts and Experience they grow wise in the Thing, and know how to command and to execute in the best manner upon every Emergency. Since the Establishment of this Regulation, it seems there has been no extraordinary Fire in that Place; and I wish there never may be any here

In 1835 a writer in ikQGawtte says, &quot;We have  
at present got engines enough, but I question if  
water enough can be had in many places to keep  
them going for half an hour. It seems to me

The writer says, &quot;As to our conduct in the  
affair of extinguishing fires, though we do not  
want good hands or good will, yet we seem to  
want order and method, and therefore I believe  
I cannot do better than to offer for our  
imitation the example of a city  
in a neighboring province. There  
is, as I am well informed, a club or society of  
active men belonging to each fire engine, whose  
business is to attend all fires with it whenever  
they happen, and to work it once a quarter and  
to see it kept in order. Some of these are to  
handle the fire hooks and others the axes, which  
are always kept with the engine, and for this  
service they are considered in an abatement or  
exemption in the taxes. In time of fire they  
are commanded by officers appointed by the  
law called Firewards, who are distinguished by  
a red staff five feet long, headed with a brass  
flame of six inches. And disobedience  
to these officers in anything at such times is  
punished by a fine of forty shillings or ten days  
imprisonment. These officers, with the men  
belonging to the engines, at their quarterly  
meetings discourse of fires of the faults com­  
mitted at some and the good management in  
some cases, at others and thus communicating  
their thoughts and experience, they grow wise  
in the thing and know how to command and to  
execnte in the best manner upon every emer­  
gency. Since the establishment of this regula­  
tion it seems there have been no great fires in  
that place, and I wish there never may be any  
here.
