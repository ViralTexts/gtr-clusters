The Cravenstreet Gazette. No 113  
  
Saturday, Sept. 22. 1770  
This Morning Queen Margaret, accompanied by her first Maid of Honour, Miss Franklin, set out for Rochester. Immediately on their Departure, the whole Street was in Tears——from a heavy Shower of Rain.  
It is whispered that the new Family Administration which took place on her Majesty’s Departure, promises, like all other new Administrations, to govern much better than the old one.  
We hear that the great Person (so called from his enormous Size) of a certain Family in a certain Street, is grievously affected at the late Changes, and could hardly be comforted this Morning, tho’ the new Ministry promised him a roasted Shoulder of Mutton, and Potatoes, for his Dinner.  
It is said, that the same great Person intended to pay his Respects to another great Personage this Day, at St. James’s, it being Coronation-Day; hoping thereby a little to amuse his Grief; but was prevented by an Accident, Queen Margaret, or her Maid of Honour having carried off the Key of the Drawers, so that the Lady of the Be

t the new Administration might have every thing at Command.  
We hear that the Lady Chamberlain of the Household went to Market this Morning by her own self, gave the Butcher whatever he ask’d for the Mutton, and had no Dispute with the Potatoe Woman——to their great Amazement——at the Change of Times!  
It is confidently asserted, that this Afternoon, the Weather being wet, the great Person a little chilly, and no body at home to find fault with the Expence of Fuel, he was indulg’d with a Fire in his Chamber. It seems the Design is, to make him contented, by Degrees, with the Absence of the Queen.  
A Project has been under Consideration of Government, to take the Opportunity of her Majesty’s Absence, for doing a Thing she was always averse to, viz. Fixing a new Lock on the Street Door, or getting a Key made to the old one; it being found extreamly inconvenient, that one or other of the Great Officers of State, should, whenever the Maid goes out for a Ha’pworth of Sand or a Pint of Porter, be obliged to attend the Door to let her in again. But Opinion, being divided, which of the two Expedients to adopt, the Project is for the present laid aside.  
We have good Authority to assure our Readers, that a Cabinet Council was held this Afternoon at Tea; the Subject of which was a Proposal for the Reformation of Manners, and a more strict Observation of the Lord’s Day. The Result was, an unanimous Resolution that no Meat should be dress’d to-morrow; whereby the Cook and the first Minister will both be at Liberty to go to Church, the one having nothing to do, and the other no Roast to rule. It seems the cold Shoulder of Mutton, and the Applepye, were thought sufficient for Sunday’s Dinner. All pious People applaud this Measure, and ’tis thought the new Ministry will soon become popular.  
We hear that Mr. Wilkes was at a certain House in Craven Street this Day, and enquired after the absent Queen. His good Lady and the Children were well.  
The Report that Mr. Wilkes the Patriot made the above Visit, is without Foundation, it being his Brother the Courtier.
