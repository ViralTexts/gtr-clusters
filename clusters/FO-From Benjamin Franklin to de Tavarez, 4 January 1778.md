Paris, Jan. 4, 1778.  
The account given in the Newspapers of my having furnished the Physicians with a receipt against the Dropsy is a Mistake. I know nothing of it, nor did I ever hear before that Tobacco Ashes had any such virtue. I thank you for your kind congratulations on our late successes and good wishes for the Establishment of our Liberty. I have the honour to be respectfully, Sir, your most obedient humble Servant,  
B. Franklin  
A Monsieur de Tavarez, Seigneur de Relaar, Docteur en Droit et en Médicine, à Zwolle en Hollande.
