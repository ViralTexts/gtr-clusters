ears. [January 8]  
  
Great Quantities of English Half-pence being Imported here, since the falling of our Exchange, to be pass’d as Pennies, some considerable Dealers were apprehensive we should be overstock’d with them, and began last Week to refuse them otherwise than at the Rate of five for four pence. Their Example being follow’d by many of the Shopkeepers, while others continued to take them for pence apiece, it occasion’d Considerable Confusion in small Dealings. And the Bakers refusing to make any more Bread ’till the Money was settled, the Mob rose on Friday Night and went round the Town breaking the Windows of several Merchants and others, and very much disturbed the City. They began to assemble again the Night following; but by the Vigilance and Resolution of some of the Magistrates, they were timely surpress’d, and the City has since remain’d quiet.

In short, He was a Person so Universally esteem’d in this Place for his many good Qualities, but especially for his Charity and Moderation towards all Religious Societies of differing Pursuasions, that his Death is much lamented by all Sorts of People.

Messrs. the Tennents, and their Adherents, are excluded the Synod, and declared to have forfeited their Right of sitting, and voting as Members thereof: The excluded Brethren immediately withdrew, and met by themselves in another Place. ’Tis said, that the Number of the Excluded was nearly equal to that of the Synod remaining. The Protestation, containing the Reasons of their Conduct, is now published by order of the Synod.

On the 4th Instant, died Andrew Hamilton, Esq; and was the next Day inter’d at Bush-Hill, his Country Seat. His Corps was attended to the Grave by a great Number of his Friends, deeply affected with their own, but more with their Country’s Loss. He lived not without Enemies: For, as he was himself open and honest, he took pains to unmask the Hypocrite, and boldly censured the Knave, without regard to Station and Profession. Such, therefore, may exult at his Death. He steadily maintained the Cause of Liberty; and the Laws made, during the time he was Speaker of the Assembly, which was many Years, will be a lasting Monument of his Affection to the People, and of his Concern for the welfare of this Province. He was no Friend to Power, as he had observed an ill use had been frequently made of it in the Colonies; and therefore was seldom upon good Terms with Governors. This Prejudice, however, did not always determine his Conduct towards them; for where he saw they meant well, he was for supporting them honourably, and was indefatigable in endeavouring to remove the Prejudices of others. He was long at the Top of his Profession here, and had he been as griping as he was knowing and active, he might have left a much greater Fortune to his Family than he has done: But he spent more Time in hearing and reconciling Differences in Private, to the Loss of his  Fees, than he did in pleading Causes at the Bar. He was just, where he sat as a Judge; and tho’ he was stern and severe in his Manner, he was compassionate in his Nature, and very slow to punish. He was the Poor Man’s Friend, and was never known to with-hold his Purse or Service from the Indigent or Oppressed. He was a tender Husband and a fond Parent: But—these are Virtues which Fools and Knaves have sometimes in common with the Wise and the Honest. His free Manner of treating Religious Subjects, gave Offence to many, who, if a Man may judge by their Actions, were not themselves much in earnest. He feared God, loved Mercy, and did Justice: If he could not subscribe to the Creed of any particular Church, it was not for want of considering them All; for he had read much on Religious Subjects. He went through a tedious Sickness with uncommon Chearfulness, Constancy and Courage. Nothing of affected Bravery or Ostentation appeared; But such a Composure and Tranquility of Mind, as results from the Reflection of a Life spent agreeable to the best of a Man’s Judgment. He preserved his Understanding and his Regard for his Friends to the last Moment. What was given as a Rule for a Poet, upon another Occasion, may be justly apply’d to Him upon this,

“religious subjects gave offence to many, who,  
“if aman may judge from their actions, were  
“not themselves much in earnest. He feared  
“God, loved mercy, and did justice. If he could  
“could not subscribe to the Creed of any par-

“ering them all, for he had read much on re-  
“‘ligious subjects. He went through a tedious

“ posure and tranquility of mind as results from  
“the reflection of a life spent agreeably to the

“understanding and his regard for his friends

“ly applied to him upon this.

His Corpse was attended to the grave by a great number of  
his friends, deeply affected with their own but more with  
their Country’s loss. He lived not without enemies ; for,  
as he was himself open and honest, he took pains to unmask  
the hypocrite, and boldly censured the knave, without  
regard to station or profession. Such, therefore, may exult  
in his death. He steadly maintained the Cause of liberty ;  
and the laws made during the time he was Speaker of the  
Assembly, which was many years, will be a lasting monu-  
ment of his affection to the people, and of his Concern for  
the welfare of this Province. He was no friend to power,  
as he had observed an ill-use had been frequently made of  
it in the Colonies; and therefore was seldom on good terms  
with the Governors. This prejudice, however, did not  
always determine his conduct towards them, for, when he  
saw they meant well, he was for supporting them honour-  
ably, and was indefatigable in endeavoring to remove the  
prejudices of others. He was long at the top of his profes

he might have left a much greater fortune to his family  
than he hasdone. But he spent much more time in hearing  
and reconciling differences in private, (to the loss of his  
fees,) than he did in pleading cases at the bar. He was just  
when he sat as Judge, and though he was stern and severe  
in his manner, he was compassionate in his nature, and  
very slow to punish. He was a tender husband and a fond  
parent. But these are virtues which fools and knaves have  
sometimes, in common with the wise and honest. His free  
manner of treating religious subjects gave offence to many,  
who, if a man may judge from their actions, were not them-  
selves much in earnest. He feared God, loved mercy, and  
did justice. If he could not subscribe to the Creed of any  
particular Church, it was not for want of considering them  
all, for he had read much on religious subjects. He went  
through a tedious sickness with uncommon cheerfulness,  
constancy and courage. Nothing of affected bravery or  
ostentation appeared ; but such a composure and tranquility  
of mind as results from the reflection of a life spent agree-
