Kind Reader,  
By way of preface (for custom says there must be a preface to every almanack) I present thee with an essay wrote by a celebrated naturalist of our country, which, if duly attended to, may be of more service to the publick, than 375 prefaces of my own writing: Take it as follows, viz. An Essay for the improvement of estates, by raising a durable timber for fencing, and other uses.  
By a diligent observation in our province, and several adjacent,

On the 18th of this month, anno 1546 died that famous reformer, Luther: who struck the great blow to papal tyranny in Europe. He was remarkably temperate in meat and drink, sometimes fasting four days together; and at other times, for many days eating only a little bread and a herring.

But chief a Father’s, Mother’s Voice revere;  
’Tis Love that chides, ’tis Love that counsels here.

To all a Parent’s Culture is resign’d.

On the 7th of this month, 1626, died that great little man, Sir Francis Bacon; great in his prodigious genius, parts and learning; and little, in his servile compliances with a little court, and submissive flattery of a little prince. Pope characterises him thus, in one strong line;  
  
If Parts allure thee, think how Bacon shin’d,  
The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.  
  
He is justly esteem’d the father of the modern experimental philosophy. And another poet treats him more favourably, ascribing his blemishes to a wrong unfortunate choice of his way of Life;  
  
———— Bacon, hapless in his choice,  
Unfit to stand the civil storm of state,  
And thro’ the smooth barbarity of courts,  
With firm, but pliant virtue, forward still  
To urge his course. Him for the studious shade  
Kind nature form’d, deep, comprehensive, clear,  
Exact, and elegant; in one rich soul,  
Plato, the Stagyrite, and Tully join’d.  
The great deliverer he! who from the gloom  
Of cloister’d monks, and jargon-teaching schools,  
Led forth the true Philosophy, there long  
Held in the magic chain of words and forms,  
And definitions void: He led her forth,  
Daughter of Heav’n! that slow ascending still,  
Investigating sure the chain of things,  
With radiant finger points to Heav’n again.  
  
May. III Month.  
O, well begun, Virtue’s great Work pursue,  
Passions at first we may with Ease subdue;  
But if neglected, unrestrain’d too long,  
Prevailing in their Growth, by Habit strong,  
They’ve wrapp’d the Mind, have fix’d the stubborn Bent,  
And Force of Custom to wild Nature lent;  
  
Who then would set the crooked Tree aright,  
As soon may wash the tawny Indian white.  
  
If Passion drives, let Reason hold the Reins.  
  
Neither trust, nor contend, nor lay wagers, nor lend;  
And you’ll have peace to your Lives end.  
  
Drink does not drown Care, but waters it, and makes it grow faster.  
Who dainties love, shall Beggars prove.

On the 12th of this month, anno 1712, died Richard the son of Oliver Cromwell, aged 90 years. And on the 13th, anno 1713, was the treaty of Utrecht signed, ending a glorious war by an inglorious peace. The Preliminaries of the new Peace, are copied from those of the old one; ’tis to be hoped the Peace itself will be better.

Newton, the heat of the sun is seven times as great as it is with us; and would make our Water boil away. For the same person found by experiments, that an heat seven times as great as the heat of the sun in summer, is sufficient to set water a boiling.  
In the machine at Derby in England for winding Italian silk, there are 26,586 wheels, 97,746 movements; 73,728 yards of silk wound every time the water-wheel goes round, which is three times every minute; 318,504,960 yards of silk in one day and night; and consequently 99,373,547,550 yards of silk in a year. One water-wheel communicates motion to all the rest of the wheels and movements, of which any one may be stopped separately, and independent of the rest. One fire-engine conveys air to every individual part of the machine, and one regulator governs the whole work.

ey see our actions, and are acquainted with our affairs, our whole body of science must appear to them as little better than ignorance; and the common herd of our learned men, scarce worth their notice. Now and then one of our very great philosophers, an Aristotle, or a Newton, may, perhaps, by his most refined speculations, afford them a little entertainment, as it seems a mimicking of their own sublime amusements. Hence Pope says of the latter,  
  
Superior beings, when of late they saw  
A mortal man unfold all nature’s law,  
Admir’d such wisdom in a human shape,  
And shew’d a Newton, as we shew an ape.  
  
On Winter.  
  
’Tis done! dread Winter spreads his latest glooms,  
And reigns tremendous o’er the conquer’d year!  
How dead the vegetable kingdon lies!  
How dumb the tuneful! Horror wide extends  
His melancholy empire. Here fond man!  
Behold thy pictur’d life! pass some few years,  
Thy flowering Spring, thy Summer’s ardent strength,  
Thy sober Autumn fading into age,  
And pale concluding Winter comes at last,  
And shuts the scene. Ah! whither now are fled  
Those dreams of greatness? Those unsolid hopes  
Of happiness? Those longings after fame?  
Those restless cares? those busy bustling days?  
Those gay-spent festive nights? those veering thoughts,  
Lost between good and ill, that shar’d thy life?  
All now are vanish’d! Virtue sole survives,  
Immortal, never-failing friend of man,  
His guide to happiness on high. Thompson.  
  
How to get Riches.  
The Art of getting Riches consists very much in Thrift. All Men are not equally qualified for getting Money, but it is in the Power of every one alike to practise this Virtue.

EAUTIFUL SNOW.

As into the sanctum lie strode ;  
&quot; If he is, I must see him at once, forsooth,  
For I winh to sell him an ode.&quot;  
Straight up to the editor&#x27;s desk he strode,  
Took a seat with a omld-like smile,  
And said to the editor, &quot;I have an ode  
On the bountiful&quot; hut the bile

On his cheek a terrible blow,  
And kicked him out into the office back yard,  
To die in the beautiful snow.
