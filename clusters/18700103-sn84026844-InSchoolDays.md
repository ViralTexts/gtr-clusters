Still sits the school house by the road,  
A ragged beggar sunning;  
Around it still the sumachs grow,  
And blackberry vines are running.  
  
Within, the master&#x27;s desk is seen,  
Deep scarred by raps official;  
The warping floor, the battered seats,  
The jack-knife&#x27;s cared initial;  
  
The charcoal frescoes on its wall;  
Its door&#x27;s worn sill, betraying  
The feet that, creeping slow to school  
Went storming out to playing!  
  
Long years ago a setting sun  
Shone over it at setting;  
Lit up its western window-panes,  
And low caves&#x27; icy fretting.  
  
It touched the tangled golden curls,  
And brown eyes full of grieving,  
Of one who still her steps delayed  
When all the school were leaving.  
  
For near her stood the little boy  
Her childish favor singled,  
His cap pulled low upon a face  
Where pride and shame were mingled.  
  
Pushing with restless feet the snow  
To right and left he lingered:—  
As restlessly her tiny hands  
The blue-checked apron fingered.  
  
He saw her lift her eyes; he felt  
The soft hand&#x27;s light caressing,  
And heard the tremble of her voice,  
As if a fault confessing.  
  
&quot;I&#x27;m sorry that I spelt the word;  
I hate to go above you,  
Because,&quot;—the brown eyes lower fell,—  
&quot;Because, you see, I love you.&quot;  
  
Still memory to a gray haired man  
That sweet child-face is showing,  
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave  
Have forty years been growing!  
  
He lives to learn, in life&#x27;s hard school,  
How few who pass above him  
Lament their triumph and his loss,  
Like her,—because they love him.

Still sits the school house by the road,  
A ragged beggnr sunning;  
Around it still the sumachs grow  
And blackberry vines are running.  
Within, tho matte-&#x27;s desk is seen,  
Deep scarred by raps official ;  
The warping floor, the battered&#x27; seats,  
The jack-nife&#x27;s carved initial.  
The charcoal frcscees on its wall;  
Its door&#x27;s worn sill betraying,  
The feet, that creeping slew to school,  
Went storming out to playing.  
Long years ago a winter sun,  
Shone over it at setting;  
Lit up its wostcrn window panes;  
And low eaves&#x27;s icy fretting.  
It touched the tangled, golden curls,  
And brown eyes full of grieving,  
Of one who still her steps delayed  
When all the school were playing.  
For near her stood the little boy  
Her childish favor singled;  
His cap pulled low upon a face  
Where pride and shame were mingled.  
Pushing with restless feet the snow  
To right and left he lingered;  
And restless&#x27;y, her tiny hands  
The bluwchccked apron angered.  
He saw her lift eyes; he felt  
The soft hanl light caressing,  
And heard the tremble of her voice  
As if a fault confessing.  
I&#x27;m sorry that I spelt the word;  
1 hate to go above you,  
Because,&quot; the brown eyes lower fell,  
&quot;Because, yon see I love youl&quot;  
Still memory to a gray-hatred man,  
That sweet child faceij showing.  
Dear girl! the grasses on ber grave  
Have forty years been growing.  
He lives to learn in life&#x27;s hard school,  
How few to pass above him,  
Lament their iriuinph and his loss,  
Like her because they love ,iini
