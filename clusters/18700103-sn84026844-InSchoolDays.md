Still sits the school house by the road,  
A ragged beggar sunning;  
Around it still the sumachs grow,  
And blackberry vines are running.  
  
Within, the master&#x27;s desk is seen,  
Deep scarred by raps official;  
The warping floor, the battered seats,  
The jack-knife&#x27;s cared initial;  
  
The charcoal frescoes on its wall;  
Its door&#x27;s worn sill, betraying  
The feet that, creeping slow to school  
Went storming out to playing!  
  
Long years ago a setting sun  
Shone over it at setting;  
Lit up its western window-panes,  
And low caves&#x27; icy fretting.  
  
It touched the tangled golden curls,  
And brown eyes full of grieving,  
Of one who still her steps delayed  
When all the school were leaving.  
  
For near her stood the little boy  
Her childish favor singled,  
His cap pulled low upon a face  
Where pride and shame were mingled.  
  
Pushing with restless feet the snow  
To right and left he lingered:—  
As restlessly her tiny hands  
The blue-checked apron fingered.  
  
He saw her lift her eyes; he felt  
The soft hand&#x27;s light caressing,  
And heard the tremble of her voice,  
As if a fault confessing.  
  
&quot;I&#x27;m sorry that I spelt the word;  
I hate to go above you,  
Because,&quot;—the brown eyes lower fell,—  
&quot;Because, you see, I love you.&quot;  
  
Still memory to a gray haired man  
That sweet child-face is showing,  
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave  
Have forty years been growing!  
  
He lives to learn, in life&#x27;s hard school,  
How few who pass above him  
Lament their triumph and his loss,  
Like her,—because they love him.

As restlessly her tiny hands

He saw her lift her eyes; he felt  
The soft hand’s light caressing,  
And heard the tremble of her voice,  
As if a fault confessing.

Sympathy with others may be effectually  
learned in times of sickness. Some one has  
used the expression “the arrogance of health,”  
conveying the difficulty of sympathizing with  
trials we have never experienced. But the  
person who has rightly borne sickness himself  
will never depreciate its trials in others, but  
will be anxious to convey in his turn the com-

STAUNTON, VIRGINIA,  
Thursday, - - - April 27, 1871  
IN SCHOOL DAYS.  
BY JOHN G- WHITTIER.  
Still sits the school house by the road,  
A ragged beggar sunning ;  
Around it still the sumac grow,  
And blackberry vines are running.  
Within, the master&#x27;s desk is seen,  
Deep scarred by rads official;  
The warping floor, the battered seats,  
The jack knife&#x27;s carved initial.  
The charcoal frescoes on its wall;  
Its door’s worn stilt betraying  
The feet that creeping slow to school,  
Went storming out t&lt;^ playing.  
Long years ago a winter sun  
Shone over it at setting ;  
Lit up its western window panes,  
And low eaves’ icy fretting.  
It touched the golden tangled curls,  
And brown eyes full of grieving,  
Of one who still her steps delayed  
When all the school were leaving.  
For near he stood the littlaboy  
Her childish favor singled ;  
His cap pulled down unon a face  
Where pride and shame were mingled.  
Fushing with restless feet the snow  
To right and left, he lingered;  
As restlessly her tiny hands  
The blue cheeked apron fingered.  
lie saw her lift her eyes : and felt  
The soft hand’s light caressing  
And heard the tremble of a voice  
As if a fault confessing.  
“1&#x27;in sorry that I spelt tlie word ;  
I hate to go above you  
Because”—the brown eyes lower fell  
“Because, you see I love you.”  
Still memory to a gray-haired man  
That sweet child face is showing.  
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave  
Have forty years been growing.  
He lives to learn, in life&#x27;s hard school,  
How few who pass above him  
Lament the triumph and his loss.  
Like her—because they love him.

The lines below are as good as when  
Whittier first wrote them, and call up  
many fond reminiscences:  
  
IN SCHOOL DAYS.  
  
Still sits the school-house by the road,  
A ragged beggar sunning;  
  
Around it still the sumachs grow,  
And blackberry vines running.  
  
Within, the master’s desk is seen,  
Deep-scarred by raps ofticial ;  
  
The warping floor, the battered seats,  
The jack-knife’s carved initial;  
  
rhe charcoal frescoes on the wall;  
Its door’s worn sill betraying  
  
The feet that, creeping slow to school,  
Went storming out to playing!  
  
Long years ago a winter sun  
Shone over it at setting;  
  
Lit up its western window-panes,  
And low eaves’ icy fretting.  
  
it touched the tangled golden curls,  
And brown eyes full of grieving,  
  
Of one who still her steps delayed  
When all the school was leaving.  
  
For near her stood the little boy  
Her childish favor singled;  
His cap pulled low upon a face  
Where pride and shame were mingled.  
  
Pushing with restless feet the snow  
To right and left, he lingered,  
  
As restlessly her tiny hands  
The blue-checked apron fingered.  
  
He saw her lift her eyes; he felt  
The soft hand’s light caressing,  
And heard the trembling of her voice,  
As if her fault confessing.  
  
‘‘ I’m sorry that I spelt the word,  
I hate to go above you,  
Because’—the brown eyes lower fell—  
‘* Because, you see, I love you!”  
  
Still memory to a gray-haired man  
That sweet child-face is showing,  
  
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave  
Have forty years been growing!  
  
He lives to learn, in life’s hard school,  
How few who pass above him  
  
Lament their triumph and his loss,  
Like her—because they love him.

Anchorage, Wis., May, 1876.  
  
— That educational veteran, Dr. George B. Emerson, of  
Massachusetts, proclaims himself opposed to the common cus-  
tom of instigating one child to surpass another. “ A child,”  
he says, ‘“ ought to try to surpass itself, and be taught to love  
other children. Many teachers make a mistake in paying too  
much attention to the brighter scholars, to the neglect of the  
poorer ones.”

an academy, where he attended for two years. The  
natural vigour of his mind would appear to have  
atoned for all scholastic deficiencies, for his poems,  
imperfections notwithstanding, have all the qualities  
of a higher culture. We are told that he was a  
steady boy, quiet and still, saying little and playing  
little, ‘but everybody’s favourite. The most inter-  
esting recollection of those days, however, is to be  
found in some charming verses of his old age, which  
we may quote here as one of the sweetest of his  
shorter poems :—

Around it still the sumachs grow,  
And blackberry vines are running.

Deep scarred by raps official ;  
  
The warping floor, the battered seats,  
The jack-knife’s carved initial.

The feet that creeping slow to school  
Went storming out to playing !

And low eaves’ icy fretting.  
  
It touched the tangled golden curls,  
And brown eyes full of grieving,  
  
Of one who still her steps delayed  
When all the school were leaving.  
  
For near her stood the little boy  
Her chiidish favour singled ;  
His cap pulled low upon a face

•■Oh, mother! Take my hand,&quot; said she.

We older children grope o.r way  
From dark behind to dark before;  
And only when our hands we lay,  
Dear Lord, lnThlne, the night is day  
And there is.darkness neverrrore.  
Reach downward to the sunless days  
Wherein our guides are blind as ws,  
And faith is small and hope delays;

POETRY In Schooldays. Still aits the

sunning . Around it still the lilaos  
grow And bltokberry-vinea are miming.  
Within the matter&#x27;s desk is seen, Deep-  
soarred by raps official; The warping  
flior, the battered seats, The jack  
knife&#x27;s carved initial. The oharooal  
freeaoes on iti wall; The door&#x27;s worn  
sill betraying Two feet that, creeping  
slow to school, Went storming oat to  
playing; Long years ago a winter inn  
Shone over it at setting ; Lit np its  
western window panes And low eaves&#x27; ioy  
fretting. It touched the tangled golden  
carls, And brown eyes fall of grieving  
Of one who Btill her steps delayed When  
all the school were leaving. For near  
her stood the little boy, Her ohildiah  
favour singled, His cap palled low apon  
a faoe Where pride and shame were  
mingled. Poshing with restless feet the  
bqow To right and left she lingered, As  
restlessly her tiny hands The blue  
sheaved apron fingered. He saw her lift  
her eyes : he felt The soft hands light  
oaresBing, And beard the tremble of her  
voioe, As if a fault confessing. 41 I&#x27;m  
sorry that I spelt the word j I hate to  
go above yon. Because&quot;-the brown eyes  
lower fell &quot;Beoauue, you see, I love yen  
1&quot; Still memory to a grey haired man  
That sweet child-face Is showing, Dear  
girl! the grasses on her grave Have  
forty years been growing. He lives to  
learn, in life&#x27;s hard sofcool, How few

 blow,  
  
And there in spring the veeries sing  
The song of long ago.  
  
And still the pines of Ramoth wood  
Are moaning like the sea,—  
  
The moaning of the sea of change  
Between myself and thee!  
  
Again, these simple but natural lines have won their  
way into the hearts of English-speaking people, because in  
them our poet in picturing a boyhood scene has imbued it  
with sentiment so delicately expressed and so true that the  
heart of humanity, being one, responds to that which recalls  
youth’s young dream, when for the first time all things are  
glorified with the indefinable rapture of love’s awakening:  
  
Still sits the schoolhouse by the road,  
A ragged beggar sunning;  
  
Around it still the sumachs grow,  
  
And blackberry vines are running.

Lit up its western window panes,
