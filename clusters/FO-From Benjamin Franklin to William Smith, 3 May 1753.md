Sir  
Philada. May 3. 1753  
Mr. Peters has just now been with me, and we have compar’d Notes on your new Piece. We find nothing in the Scheme of Education, however excellent, but what is, in our Opinion, very practicable. The great Difficulty will be, to find the Aratus, and other suitable Persons, in New York, to carry it into Execution; but such may be had, if proper Encouragement be given. We have both receiv’d great Pleasure in the Perusal of it. For my Part, I know not when I have read a Piece that has more affected me, so noble and just are the Sentiments, so warm and animated the Language. Yet, as Censure from your Friends may be of more Use as well as more agreable to you than Praise, I ought to mention, that I wish you had omitted, not only the Quotation from the Review, which you are now justly dissatisfy’d with, but all those Expressions of Resentment against your Adversaries, in Pages 65 and 79. In such Cases, the noblest Victory is obtained, by Neglect, and by Shining on.  
Mr. Allen has been out of Town these 10 days; but, before he went, directed me to procure him 6 of your Pieces, tho’ he had not and has not yet seen it. Mr. Peters has taken 10: He purposed to have wrote to you; but omits it as he expects so soon to have the Pleasure of seeing you here. He desires me to present his affectionate Regards to you, and to assure you, that you will be very welcome to him. I shall only say, that you may depend on my doing all in my Power to make your Visit to Philadelphia agreable to you.

Sir,  
  
Mr. PETERS has juft now been  
with me, and we have compared  
notes on your new piece. We find  
nothing inthe {cheme of education,  
however excellent, but what is; in  
our opinion, very practicable. The  
great difficulty will be, to find the  
Aratus,* and other fuitable perfons,  
to carry it into execution ; but fuch  
may be had if proper encourage-  
ment be given. We have bothre-  
ceived great pleafure in the perufal  
of it. For my part, I know not  
when I have read a piece that has  
more affected me—{u noble and juft  
are the fentiments, fo warm and  
animated the language ; yet as cen-  
fure from your friends may be of  
more ufe, as well as more agreea-  
ble to you, than praife, I ought to  
mention, that I wifh you had o-  
mitted, not only the quotation from  
the Review,+ which you are now  
juftly diffatistied with, but thofe ex-  
preffions of refentment againft your  
adverfaries, in pages 65 and 79. In  
fuch cafes, the nobleft victory is ob-  
tained by neglect, and by fhining on.

thefe ten days; but, before he went

taken ten. He purpofed to have  
written to you; but omits it, as he  
expects fo foon to have the pleafure  
of feeing you here. He defires me  
to prefent his affectionate compli-  
ments to you, and to aflure you  
that you will be very welcome to  
him. I fhall only fay, that you may  
depend on my doing all in my pow-
