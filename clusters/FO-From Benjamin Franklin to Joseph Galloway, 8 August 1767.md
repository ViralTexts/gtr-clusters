f Opinion with you that those Merchants here who have made Difficulties on the Subject of the legal Tender, have not “understood their own Interest. For there can be no doubt, that should a Scarcity of Money continue among us, we shall take off less of their Merchandize, and attend more to manufacturing and raising the Necessaries and Superfluities of Life among ourselves, which we now receive from them.” And perhaps this consequence would attend our making no Paper-money at all of any Sort, that being thus by a want of Cash driven to Industry and Frugality, we should gradually become more rich without their Trade than we can possibly be with it; and by keeping in the Country the real Cash that comes into it, have in time a Quantity sufficient for all our Occasions. But I suppose our People will scarce have Patience to wait for this.  
I have received the printed Votes but not the Laws. I hear nothing yet of any Objection made by the Proprietaries to any of them at the Board of Trade.  
Please to present my Duty to the Assembly, with Thanks for their Care of me; and assure them of my most faithful Services.  
With sincerest

I think with you that those merchants  
here who have made difficulties on the  
  
subject of the legal tender have not under  
  
stood their own interests. For there can  
  
be no doubt that should a scarcity of mon  
  
ey continue among ust we shall take off  
  
less of their merchandize and attend more  
  
to manufacturing and raising the necessa  
  
ries and superfluities of life among ourselves  
  
which we now receive from them. And  
perhaps this consequence would attend our  
making no paper money at all of any sort;  
  
that being thus by a want of cash driven to  
  
industry and frugality, we should gradually  
  
become more rich without their trade than  
  
we probably can with it, and by keeping in  
the country The Real CASil that comes  
  
into it, have in time a quantity sufficient  
  
for all our occasions.&quot;  
  
China. Wa leatn, by a recenl ihhiat  
  
from China, that as the difficulties with the  
  
nriten increased, the Americans appeared  
to be growing in greater favor with the  
Chinese. An American lady, residing st  
Macao, had been invited by the princinal  
  
Chinese officers at Canton, to visit thal el­  
ty and had actually done so, and ridden  
  
several miles into the country by invits.
