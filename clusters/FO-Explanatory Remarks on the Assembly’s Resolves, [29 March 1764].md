On March 30, 1764, the day after the Pennsylvania Gazette printed the recent messages between the governor and the Assembly and the twenty-six Assembly “Resolves upon the Present Circumstances,” Joseph Galloway wrote to William Franklin enclosing “a Copy of your worthy Father’s Remarks on our Assembly Resolves. No answer has yet been attempted by the Proprietary Faction, who seem much depressed.”

]  
Explanatory REMARKS on the ASSEMBLY’S RESOLVES,published in the Pennsylvania Gazette, No. 1840.  
Resolves of Assembly being short Resolutions, formed after Debate and full Consideration of any particular Matter, they are generally very concise, and seldom contain the Reasons at large upon which they are founded; and although they are always so full and expressive, as to be clearly understood by those who have attended to the Subject, yet, to enable others rightly to comprehend their Meaning, an explanatory Account of the Facts seems necessary. It is with this View the following Remarks are submitted to the Consideration of the Publick.  
Remarks on Resolve the First. As this Resolve is the first in Order, so it is the most important, and is intended to point out the deepest Wound which has been made, by an undue Attachment to Proprietary Interest, in the original Constitution of this Government. By the Royal Grant, “free, full and absolute Power,” is given to the Proprietary “Lieutenants” and Governors, “to ordain, make, and enact Laws, for the Raising of Money, &amp;c. according to their best Discretion, with the Advice, Consent and Approbation of the Freemen of the Country, or of their Delegates and Deputies.” The Powers of Legislature being thus fully granted by the Crown, to the Governor for the Time being, and the Peoples Representatives, ’tis evident the Proprietaries can have no Constitutional Share in Legislation, or Right to give Instructions to their Governor, whereby his “Discretion” must be totally destroyed. And therefore all such Instructions are a manifest Violation of the Royal Favour to the good People of this Province, and a most dangerous Invasion on the Rights of the Subject. They not only destroy the Exercise of Judgment in the Governor, but render the Representative Body of the People mere Cyphers in the Constitution. And vain is it for the People to send their Delegates to the Seat of Representation, as all they can do when met, is to give up their Freedom and Exercise of Judgment, betray those very Rights they were sent to preserve, and servilely submit to Proprietary Will and Pleasure. Much better will it be for the Inhabitants of Pennsylvania to invest the Proprietaries with absolute Power at once, permit them to ordain and enact Laws at Three Thousand Miles Distance, and only transmit them here for Publication and Execution. For whose Interest they will in that Case be calculated, and of what Spirit they will partake, modern Measures have fully demonstrated.

o himself and his Heirs, their final Assent to the Laws” which should be passed; and thus assumed the Royal Power, which by the original Charter was reserved to the Crown. How evidently does this demonstrate, that Men of the fairest Characters are not to be trusted, when under the Influence of private Interest. A virtuous Opposition, however, both in the Proprietary Council, and Assembly, repelled this Invasion of their Rights, and the Reservation was declared illegal and void. And from this Time Proprietary Instructions never appeared, till in the Beginning of the late War. A Time when the Frontiers were bleeding in every Quarter, and the unhappy Inhabitants reduced to every Kind of Misery and Distress that the deepest Want, and the most relentless Barbarities of a savage Enemy could devise and inflict. This it seems was thought the most convenient Time to enforce those Claims, and reduce the People to a Subjection to them. And certainly a Time like this was necessary to their Success. For, upon their being laid before the Assembly, they plainly appeared to be formed solely with a View to increase the immense Wealth of the Proprietaries, and to oblige the People to bear their Burthens; and were found equally regardless of the Orders of the Crown, as of the Good and Safety of the distressed Inhabitants.  
Influenced by these illegal Instructions, what unjust Claims have the Governors of this Province made in Favour of their Principals! They first insisted that the Proprietaries should not be taxed at all, although their Property was to receive equal Protection from it; then that their Quitrents should not be rated; next that their located and uncultivated Lands should be exempted; and lastly, that the Bills of Credit, issued as well for the Protection of their Property as that of the Inhabitants, should not be a Tender in the Payment of their Rents, contrary to all Justice and good Conscience. The Assembly, consistent with that Duty they indispensably owed to their Constituents, could not agree to these unjust Demands. This created Disputes; those Disputes created Delays, which greatly obstructed His Majesty’s Measures; and whether the Proprietary Pretensions, or the Assembly’s Opposition, were most just and well founded, is submitted to the Candid and Impartial.  
Resolve the Fourth. It is certainly an high Presumption in the Pr

ement, and undue Influence, prevailed on to grant the Monies arising by Tavern Licences to support his Deputy. The Monies received from this Source, and the Sums given to the Governors for Forty Years past, will amount to more than the Sum mentioned in the Resolve.  
Resolve the Seventh, appears to be just, from many of the other Resolves.  
Resolve the Eighth. It is notorious, the Number of Taverns, Alehouses and Dram-shops, have encreased beyond all Measure or Necessity. That they are placed so near to each other, that they ruin one another; and Two Thirds of them are not merely useless, but are become a Pest to Society. There are very few of them that are able to provide the necessary Conveniences for entertaining Travellers, or accommodating the People either in Country or City; and this is entirely owing to that weak Policy in a former Assembly, of making it the Interest of a Governor to encourage and promote Immorality and Vice among the People. Many Bills have been presented to the late Governors, to lessen the Number, and to regulate those Nurseries of Idleness and Debauchery, but without Success. From whence it seems evident, that so long as the Proprietaries are interested in our Ruin, ruined we must be: For no Deputy will dare to regulate this Mischief, because it will lessen the Revenue; nor accept a Compensation for this Revenue, as it will affect his Successor; nor even accept a greater Annuity, because it may, in Time, encrease to an higher Sum.  
Resolve the Ninth. The purchasing or taking up large Tracts of Land on the Frontiers, to lay by for a future Market, must prevent a compact Settlement of the People, render them less defensible, and of Course encrease the Taxes necessary for their Protection.  
Resolve Tenth and Eleventh. In Virginia and Carolina the People pay no Purchase Money for their Lands, and in the former only Two Shillings, and in the latter Four Shillings and Two-pence Sterling Quit-rent per Hundred Acres. In Pennsylvania the Proprietaries Waste Lands are sold for Fifteen Pounds Ten Shillings per Hundred Acres; their Manor Lands from Fifty to Sixty times that Value, with an annual Quit-rent reserved of Four Shillings and Two-pence Sterling per Hundred Acres. This exorbitant Price, with the great Difficulty of obtaining Justice at the Land Office, and the continued public Disputes, occasioned by Proprietary Exactions and Instructions, have driven a great Number of wealthy Settlers into the Southern

. The People of our Mother Country, under the immediate Government of a Sovereign who had little private Interest in the Kingdom to influence him, have thought that they had no Security in their Lives, Liberties and Properties, while the Judges of the several Courts held their Commissions during the Pleasure of the Crown. If they were right, how much more precarious and insecure are those invaluable Blessings in this Province, where so great and unjust an Attachment to the Interest of the Proprietaries is discovered, who are not only consulted in the Nomination of the Judges, but can, and often have, from Reasons of Policy only, removed them at their Pleasure? The Time may come, when the People of Pennsylvania may experience the arbitrary Policy of a Richard the Second, and a James the Second, and the unjust and cruel Determinations of the servile Belknap, and the blood-thirsty Jeffries.  
Resolve the Seventeenth [16].

rate the Truth of this Resolve.  
Resolve the Nineteenth [17]. However safe it may be to entrust an immediate Governor under the Crown with the Nomination of Militia Officers, who has no private Interest or Schemes of his own to promote, it certainly never can be safe to commit that Power into the Hands of a Deputy of the Proprietaries, bound by penal Obligations to obey Instructions wholly calculated to promote their private Interest. If we may judge from what we have seen, they would, no doubt, commission none but those who would implicitly obey their Orders, and pursue their Schemes for enslaving the People. This would create a vast Number of New Relations and Dependencies in the Government, all under the Controul of the Proprietaries and their Governors, who holding their Offices during their Pleasure, would no doubt conform to that Pleasure. The Officers would influence the private Men, and the whole would influence our Elections in Favour of the Proprietary System, and by these Means render their Will the sole Rule, in both the Executive and Legislative Parts of Government.

. No sooner did the Proprietaries obtain the Opinion of our Superiors, that the Bills of Credit should not be a Tender in the Payment of their Rents, than they laid a new Scheme for putting their Purchase Money, and other Contracts, under the same Circumstances, that thereby they might not, in common with the People of this Province, suffer by a Depreciation, in case it should happen, though in common with the People they reaped all the Advantages of those Bills, and though the Protection of their Estates, in common with the Peoples, rendered the emitting them necessary. They accordingly gave Orders to their Commissioners of Property, to make their future Contracts for the Sale of Lands in Sterling; and by their Instructions to their Governor, positively forbid him to pass any Supply Bill, unless those Contracts are also exempted from being discharged by the said Bills. This seems, in the Opinion of the House, to have been one of the Causes of the Failure of the Supply Bill. To which may be added, that by the Bill, had it passed, the Proprietary Agents would be obliged to give an honest Account of their Estates, under a Penalty of Four-fold the Tax for all Property by them wittingly concealed. And when we consider the many Instances of the most unjust Claims of Exemption from Taxes by the Proprietaries, this alone will appear an Objection likely to be strong enough with their Deputy to reject the Bill, the House having complied fully with the Stipulations their Agents had entered into before the Council.

BROOKLYN, July 21, 1894.  
  
WHEN preparing my “ Bibliography of  
Franklin ” some years ago, I spent much time  
trying to unravel a sentence in a letter of  
Joseph Galloway&#x27;s to William Franklin, dated  
March 30, 1764, in which he stated: ‘* I enclose  
a Copy of your worthy Father’s Remarks on

been attempted by the Proprietary Faction,

The purchasing or tak-  
ing up large Tracts of  
Land on the Frontiers to  
lay by for a future Mar-  
ket, must prevent a com-  
pact Settlement of the  
People, render them less  
defensible, and of Course  
encrease the Taxes ne-  
cessary for their Protec-  
tion.  
  
In Virginia and Caro-  
lina the People pay no  
Purchase Money for their  
Lands, and in the for  
mer only Two Shillings,  
and in the latter Four  
Shillings and Two-pence  
Sterling Quit-rent per  
Hundred Acres. In Penn-  
sylvania the Proprieta-  
ries Waste Lands are sold  
for Fifteen Pounds Ten  
Shillings per Hundred  
Acres; their Manor  
Lands from Fifty to Six-  
ty times that Value, with  
an annual Quit-rent re-  
served of Four Shillings  
and Two Pence Sterling  
per Hundred Acres. This  
Exorbitant Price, with  
the great Difficulty of  
obtaining Justice at the  
Land Office, and the con-  
tinued public Disputes,  
occasioned by Proprieta-  
ry Exactions and Instruc-  
tions. have driven a great  
Number of Wealthy Set-  
  
those of earlier times.

ment to Proprietary In-  
terest, and to encrease  
the Revenue of their De-  
puties arising from their  
Licenees, the Benevo-  
lence of the People in  
granting the same has  
been grossly abused, and  
public Houses and Dram-  
shops have been en-  
creased to an enormous  
Degree, to the great Cor-  
ruption of Morals in the  
Populace, and Scandal of  
the Government; and  
that, from the same  
Causes, reasonable Bills  
presented to Proprietary  
Governors, for restrain-  
ing or preventing this  
Evil, have been from  
Time to Time refused.  
  
  
  
FRANKLIN&#x27;S REMARES.  
  
It is notorious, the  
Number of Taverns, Ale-  
houses and Dram-shops,  
have encreased beyond  
all Measure or Necessity.  
That they are placed so  
near to each other, that  
they ruin one another;  
and Two Thirds of them  
are not merely useless,  
but are become a Pest to  
Society. There are very  
few of them that are  
able to Provide the ne-  
cessary Conveniences for  
entertaining Travellers,  
or accommodating the  
People either in Country  
or City; and this is en-  
tirely owing to that weak  
Policy in a former As-  
sembly, of making it the  
Interest of a Governor to  
encourage and promote  
  
Immorality and Vice  
among the People Many Bills have been presented  
to the late Governors, to lessen the Number, and to  
regulate those Nurseries of Idleness and Debauch-  
ery, but without success. From whence it seems  
evident, that so long as the Proprietaries are inte-  
rested in our Ruin, ruined we must be: For no  
Deputy will dare to regulate this Mischief, because  
it will lessen the Revenue, nor accept a Compensa  
tion for this Revenue, as it will affect his suc-  
cessor; nor even accept a greater Annuity, because  
it may, in Time, encrease to an higher Sum.  
  
The fifteenth and seventeenth resolutions  
relate to an equally familiar condition of the  
politics of to-day, in the use of the civil ser-  
vice for political purposes, with a view to de-  
feating the wishes of the very voters these  
public officials were supposed to serve:  
  
However safe it may be to entrust immediate  
Governor&#x27;s under the Crown with the Nomination  
of Militia Officers . . . it certainly never can be  
safe to commit that Power into the Hands of a Dep-  
uty of the Proprietaries, bound by penal Obligations  
to obey Instructions wholly calculated to promote  
their private Interest. If we may judge from what  
we have seen, they would, no doubt, commission  
none but those who would implicitly obey their Or-  
ders, and pursue their Schemes for enslaving the  
People. This would create a vast Number of new  
Relations and Dependencies in the Government, all  
under the Controul of the Proprietaries and their Gov-  
ernors, who holding their Offices during their Plea-  
sure, would no doubt conform to that Pleasure.  
The Officers would influence the private Men, and  
the whole would influence our elections in favour  
of the Proprietary System, and by these Means ren-  
der their will the sole Rule, in both the Executive and  
the Legislative Parts of Government.

new Scheme for putting  
their Purchase Money,  
and other Contracts, un-  
der the same Circum-  
stances, that thereby they  
might not, in common  
with the People of this  
Province, suffer by a De-  
preciation, in case _ it  
should happen, though in  
common with the People  
they reaped all the Ad-  
vantages of those Bills, and though the Protection  
of their Estates, in common with the People’s, ren-  
der the emitting them necessary. They accordingly  
gave Orders to their Commissioners of Property to  
make their future Contracts for the Sale of Land in  
Sterling; and by their Instructions to their Govern-  
or, positively forbid him to pass any Supply Bill,  
unless those Contracts are also exempted from be-  
ing discharged by the said Bills. This seems, in the  
Opinion of the House, to have been one of the causes  
of the Failure of the Supply Bill. To which may be  
added, that by the Bill, had it passed. the Proprie-  
tary Agents would be obliged to give an honest Ac-  
count of their Estates, under a penalty of Four-fold  
the Tax for all Property by them wittingly con  
cealed. But when we consider the many Instances  
of the most unjust Claims of Exemption from Taxes  
by the Proprietaries, this alone will appear an Ob-  
jection likely to be strong enough with their Deputy  
to reject the Bill, the House having complied fully  
with the stipulations their Agents had entered into  
before the Council.
