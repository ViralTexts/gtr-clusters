N.B. Gather the Grapes after the Dew is off, and in all dry Seasons. Let not the Children come at the Must, it will scour them severely. If you make Wine for Sale, or to go beyond Sea, one quarter Part must be distill’d, and the Brandy put into the three Quarters remaining. One Bushel of Grapes, heap Measure, as you gather them from the Vine, will make at least a Gallon of Wine, if good, five Quarts.  
These Directions are not design’d for those who are skill’d in making Wine, but for those who have hitherto had no Acquaintance with that Art.

From Georgia t’Augustine the General goes;  
From Augustine to Georgia come our Foes;

Again from thence to Charlestown back he flies.

Say, Children, is not this your Play, Bo-peep?

From an insolent Friend, and a termagant Wife,  
From the Kindred of such (on one Side or t’other)  
Who most wisely delight in plaguing each other;  
From the Wretch who can cant, while he Mischief designs,  
From old rotten Mills, bank’d Meadows and Mines;  
From Curses like these if kind Heav’n defends me,  
I’ll never complain of the Fortune it sends me.
