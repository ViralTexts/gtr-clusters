tions, and to add some new experiments.” Comparison of the two editions shows that of Franklin’s twenty-eight specific criticisms Wilson ignored all but seven. In five instances he made relatively small changes or incorporated explanatory footnotes; twice only he made major changes. These are all described below in footnotes at the appropriate places, as are a few additional revisions involving Franklin’s writings, but no attempt is made here to discuss other changes or additions in the second edition.

The authors cite Newton’s theory of an all-pervading “fluid” called “aether,” which is “much rarer within the dense Bodies of the Sun, Stars, Planets, and Comets, than in the empty celestial space between them,” and becomes denser the farther away it gets from these bodies. By causing each body to try to go “from the denser parts of the aether towards the rarer,” this aether causes g

m all the above experiments it appears that the electrical fluid is as universal and powerful an agent at or near the earth’s surface as that fluid Newton calls aether. It is as subtle and elastic, it similarly pervades the pores of all bodies, is dispersed through whatever vacuum we can create, and from the appearance of thunder and lightning seems to be extended to great distances in the air. “We shall make no scruple therefore now to affirm, that these two fluids are one and the same fluid.’ It is much more philosophical to do so than to suppose two such fluids equally present everywhere and equally capable of producing the same effects. The word electrical is much too confining a meaning for so universal an activity as this is found to be. “Electricity means no more than the power we give bodies by rubbing them, to attract and repell light bodies” near them, as amber does when rubbed. This fluid not only does so but it heats them by putting their component particles and the particles of light and air within them into vibration, “and makes them throw out the rays of light that before lay hid,” and part with their sulfurous and volatile particles which, with the rays of light, on mixing with the air, “burst out into sparks of real culinary fire,” as the chemists call it. Furthermore, in passing through animals it occasions convulsions, tremors, pain, and sometimes death, and it even fuses glass and gold into an enamel.  
278. What is meant by Rays of Light that before lay hid? See, 240, 283, 286, 288, 289.  
279–301. It is as improper to call this fluid “fire” as it is to call air “sound.” When sound is produced the particles of air are put into vibrations which convey the idea of sound through the ear. So when this fluid throws the particles of a body into such agitations in the air that i
