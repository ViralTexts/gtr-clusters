Praise your Wife.  
  
Praise your wife man; for pity&#x27;s sake give her a little encouragement; it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has made your home comfortable, your hearth bright and shining, your food agreeable; for pity&#x27;s sake tell her you thank her, if nothing more. She don&#x27;t expert it; it will make her eyes open wider than they have for these ten years, but it will do her good for all that, and you too.  
  
There are many women to day thirst­ing for the word of praise, the language of encouragement. Through the Summer&#x27;s heat and Winter&#x27;s toil they have drudged uncomplainingly, and so accustomed have their fathers, brothers and husbands become to their monotonous labors, that they look for and upon them as they do daily rising of the sun and its daily going down. Homely every-day life may be made beautiful by an appreciation of its very homeliness. You know that if the door is clean, manual labor has been performed to make it so. You know that if you can take from your drawer a clean shirt whenever you want it, that somebody&#x27;s fingers have ached in the toil of making it so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lustrous. Everything that pleases the eye and the sense has been procured by constant work, much thought, great care and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
  
It is not that many men do not appre­ciate these things and feel a glow of grat­itude for the numberless attentions be­stowed upon them in sickness and in health, but they are so selfish in that feel­ing. They don&#x27;t come out with a hear­ty, &#x27;Why, how pleasant you make things look, wife!&#x27; or, &#x27;I am obliged to you for taking so much pains!&#x27; They thank the tailor for giving them &quot;fits,&quot; they thank the man in the omnibus who gives them a seat; they thank the *young* lady who moves along in the concert-room--in short, they thank everybody out of doors because it is the custom, and come home, tip their chairs hack and their heels up, pull out the newspaper, grumble if wife asks them to take the baby, scold if the fire has got down, or, if everything is just right shut their mouths with a smack of satisfaction but never say to her, &quot;I thank  
you.&quot;  
  
I tell you what, men young and old, if you did but show an *ordinary civility* toward those common articles of house­ keeping, your wives, if you gave the one hundred and sixtieth part of the compli­ments you almost choked them with be­fore they were married, if you would stop the badinage about who you are going to have when number one is dead, (such things wives may laugh at, but they sink deep sometimes,) if you would cease to speak of their faults, however banteringly, before others, fewer women would seek for other sources of happiness than your apparently cold, so-soish affection.--  
  
Praise you wife, then, for all good qual­ities she has, and you may rest assured that her deficiencies are fully counterbal­anced by your own. *--Olive Branch.*

y?  
The young lady (to use the words of the ad  
  
vertisement) captured the pickpocket. The  
bachelor&#x27;s button no longer adorns my blue  
  
coat, and I now have framed and glazed over  
the freplace, the advertisement, in which I  
am publicly described by my own wife, as a  
&quot;pickpocket with a gentlemanly address.&quot;  
When I charge her with tha libel, she always  
does what she has just this moment done,  
pay damages for the slander in any amount  
of kisses, declaring, though-not a pickpocket.  
I was a thief, and stole her heart and pock­  
eted her bracelet.  
So ends the story of A BAcHELOR&#x27;s BuTTON.

that, and you too.

Animalcules have been discovered so  
small that one million would not exceed  
a grain of sand, and five hundred mill­  
ions would sport in a drop of water.—  
Yet each of these must have blood-ves­  
sels, nerves, muscles, circulating fluids,  
etc., like large animals.   
The circumference of the earth is 25,-  
000 miles. A railway train, traveling  
incessently, night and day, at the rate  
of twenty-six miles an hour, would re­  
quire six weeks to go round it. A tun­  
nel through the earth, from England to  
New Zealand, would be nearly eight  
thousand miles long.   
  
Praise Your Wife.—Praise your  
wife, man ; lor pity’s sake, give her a  
little encouragement: it won’t hurt her.  
She has made your home comfortable,  
your hearth bright and shining, your  
food agreeable; for pity’s sake, tell her  
you thank her, if nothing more. She  
don’t expect it; it will make her eyes  
open wider than they have done these  
ten years, but it will do her good for all  
that, and you too. There are many  
women to-day thirsting for the word of  
praise, the language of encouragement.  
But so accostomed have their fathers,  
brothers, and husbands become to their  
monotonous duties, that they look for  
and upon them as they do the daily sun  
and his daily going down. Everything  
that pleases the eye and the sense at homo  
has been produced by constant work,  
much though great and untiring efforts,  
bodily and mentally.   
It is not that men do no appreciate  
these things and feel a glow of grati­  
tude fur the numberless attentions be­  
stowed upon them in health and sick­  
ness but they are so selfish in that feel­  
ing. They don’t come out with a hear­  
ty “Why, how pleasant you make things  
look, wife !” or “I am obliged to you for  
taking so much pains.” They thank  
everybody and everything out of doors  
because it is the cnston, and tip their  
chair back and their heels up, pull  
out their newspaper, grumble, if wife  
asks them to do any thing,scold if the fire  
has gone down, or if everything is just  
right, shut their mouths. I tell you,  
what, men,young and old, if you did but  
show ordinary civility toward those  
common articles of housekeeping, your  
wives ; if you gave the one hundred and  
sixtieth part of the compliments you al­  
most choked them with before they  
were married ; and finally if you would  
cease to speak of their faults before  
others, fewer woman would seek for  
other sources of happiness than your  
cold so-so-ish affection. Praise your  
wife, then, for all the good qualities she  
has,and you may rest assured that her  
deficiencies are fully counterballanced  
by your own.

Praise yoijr WrFR.—Praise yontf  
wife, men, for pity1* sake, give her 4  
little encouragement—it won&#x27;t hint  
her. She has made your home eoirtl  
fortable, your hearth bright and shim

There are many women to-day thirst­

heat, and wintet&#x27;s toil, they have  
drudged uncomplainingly, and so ac­  
customed have their fathers, brother&#x27;],  
and husbands become to their monot«i  
nous labor, that they look for and npoiji  
them as they do upon the daily rising  
of the sun and its daily going dowij.  
Homely, every-day life may be madi­  
beautiful by an appreciation of its veiT  
homeliness. You know that if tlij­  
door is clean, manual labor has hoeji  
performed to make it so. You kno*  
that if you can take from your drawer  
a clean shirt whenever you want is,  
somebody’s fingers have ached in tin­  
toil of making it so fresh and agrees*­  
ble, so smooth and lustrous. Kveryj­  
thing that pleases the eye and the sen^  
has been produced by constant workj  
much thought, great care and untirinjS  
efforts, bodily and mentally. It is n&lt;7  
that many men do not appreciate thesj­  
things, and feel a glow of gratitude for  
the numberless attentions be»towt«&lt;jl  
upon upon them in sickness and Wi  
health, but they are so selfish in tluM.

hearty “ Why, how pleasant you mnkj­
