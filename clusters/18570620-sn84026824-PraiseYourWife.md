Praise your Wife.  
  
Praise your wife man; for pity&#x27;s sake give her a little encouragement; it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has made your home comfortable, your hearth bright and shining, your food agreeable; for pity&#x27;s sake tell her you thank her, if nothing more. She don&#x27;t expert it; it will make her eyes open wider than they have for these ten years, but it will do her good for all that, and you too.  
  
There are many women to day thirst­ing for the word of praise, the language of encouragement. Through the Summer&#x27;s heat and Winter&#x27;s toil they have drudged uncomplainingly, and so accustomed have their fathers, brothers and husbands become to their monotonous labors, that they look for and upon them as they do daily rising of the sun and its daily going down. Homely every-day life may be made beautiful by an appreciation of its very homeliness. You know that if the door is clean, manual labor has been performed to make it so. You know that if you can take from your drawer a clean shirt whenever you want it, that somebody&#x27;s fingers have ached in the toil of making it so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lustrous. Everything that pleases the eye and the sense has been procured by constant work, much thought, great care and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
  
It is not that many men do not appre­ciate these things and feel a glow of grat­itude for the numberless attentions be­stowed upon them in sickness and in health, but they are so selfish in that feel­ing. They don&#x27;t come out with a hear­ty, &#x27;Why, how pleasant you make things look, wife!&#x27; or, &#x27;I am obliged to you for taking so much pains!&#x27; They thank the tailor for giving them &quot;fits,&quot; they thank the man in the omnibus who gives them a seat; they thank the *young* lady who moves along in the concert-room--in short, they thank everybody out of doors because it is the custom, and come home, tip their chairs hack and their heels up, pull out the newspaper, grumble if wife asks them to take the baby, scold if the fire has got down, or, if everything is just right shut their mouths with a smack of satisfaction but never say to her, &quot;I thank  
you.&quot;  
  
I tell you what, men young and old, if you did but show an *ordinary civility* toward those common articles of house­ keeping, your wives, if you gave the one hundred and sixtieth part of the compli­ments you almost choked them with be­fore they were married, if you would stop the badinage about who you are going to have when number one is dead, (such things wives may laugh at, but they sink deep sometimes,) if you would cease to speak of their faults, however banteringly, before others, fewer women would seek for other sources of happiness than your apparently cold, so-soish affection.--  
  
Praise you wife, then, for all good qual­ities she has, and you may rest assured that her deficiencies are fully counterbal­anced by your own. *--Olive Branch.

PRAISE YOUR WIFE.  
  
Praise your wife, man for pity&#x27;s sake  
give her a little encouragement; it won&#x27;t

comfortable, your hearth bright and shi

There are many women to day thirst­

heat, and winter&#x27;s tcil they have drudg­

have their fathers, brothers and hus­  
bands become to their monotonous la­  
bors that they look for and upon them  
as they do the daily rising of the sun  
and its daily going down. Homely ev­  
ery day life may be made beautiful by  
an appreciation of its very homeliness.  
You know that if the floor 13 clean,  
manual labor has been performed to  
make it so. You know that if you can  
take from your drawyer a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, somebody&#x27;s fin­  
gers have ached in the toil of making it  
so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and  
lustrous. Everything that pleases the  
eye and the sense has been produced by  
constant work, much thought, great care  
and untiring efforts, bodily aud men­  
tally.It is not that many men do not ap­  
preciate these things, and feel a flow of  
gratitude for the numberless attentions  
bestowed upon them in sickness and in  
health, but they are so selfish in that  
feclirig. They don&#x27;t come out with a  
hearty &quot;Why, how pleasant you make  
things look, wife;&quot; or, &quot;I am obliged to  
you for taking so much pains.&quot; They  
thank the tailor for giving them &quot;fits;&quot;  
they thank the man in the full omnibus  
who gives them a seat; shey thank the  
young lady who moves along in the  
conceit room, in short, they thank eve­  
rybody and everything out of doors, be­

tip their chairs back and their heels up.  
pull out the newspaper, grumble if wife  
asks them to take the baby, scold if the  
fire has gone down, or, if everything is  
just right, shut their mouths with -a.  
smack 01 satisfaction, but never say to  
her &quot;I thank you.&quot;  
I tell you what, men. young and old,  
if you did but show an ordinary civility  
towards those common articles of house­  
keeping, your wives, if you gave the one  
hundred and sixtieth part of the com­  
pliments you almost chocked them with  
before they were married; if you would  
stop the badinage about whom you are  
going to have when iiiHiiber one is dead,  
(such things a wife may laugh at, but  
they sink deep sometimes.) if you would  
cease to speak of their faults however  
banteringly, before others, fewer women  
would seek for other sources of happi­  
ness, than your cold so-so-isli affection.  
Praise your wife, then, for all good  
qualities she has, and you may rest as­

counterbalanced by your own.

give her a little comfort, it won&#x27;t hurt her.  
Bdie has made your home comfortable, your  
hearth bright and shining, yohr food agree­  
able; for pity&#x27;s sake tell her you thank her,  
if nothing more. She don&#x27;t expect it; it  
will make her eyes open wider than they  
have done these ten years, but it will do  
her good for all that, and you too. There  
are women to-day thirsting for the word  
of praise, the language of encouragement.  
Through Summer&#x27;s heat and Winter&#x27;s toil  
they have drudged uncomplaining, and so  
accustomed have their fathers, brothers  
and husbands become to their monotonous I  
labors, that they look for and upon them as  
they do the daily rising of the sun aud its  
daily going down.  
Homely every-day life may be made  
beautil&#x27;ul by an appreciation of its very  
homeliness. You know that if you can  
take from your drawer a clean shirt when­  
ever you want it, that somebody&#x27;s fingers  
have ached in the toil of making it so  
smooth and lustrous. Everything that  
pleases the eye and sense has been produc­  
ed by constant work, much thought, great  
care and untiring efforts, bodily and men­  
tally.  
It is not that many men do not appreci­  
ate these things and feel a glow of grati­  
tude for the numberless attentions bestow­  
ed upon them in sickness and in health,  
but they are so selfish in that feeling.—  
They don&#x27;t come out with a hearty&quot; Why,  
how pleasant you made things look, wife !&quot;  
or &quot; J am much obliged to you for taking  
so much pains!&quot; They thank the tailor  
for giving them &quot;fits;&quot; they thank the  
man in a full omnibus who gives them a  
scat, thank the young lady who moves  
alontr the concert room, in short tlicy thank  
everything out of doors because it is the  
custom, and come home, tip their chairs  
back and their heels up, pull out a news­  
paper, grumble if wile asks them to take  
  
| the baby, scold if the fire has got low, or,  
if anything is just right, shut their mouth  
with a smack of satisfaction, but never say  
to her.&quot; I thank you.&quot;  
I tell what, men young and old, if you  
hut show. ordinary civility toward those  
Common articles of housekeeping, your  
wives, it you gave the one hundred and  
sixtieth part of the compliments you al­  
most choked them with before they mar­  
ried, ii you would stop the badinage about  
who you are going have when number I is  
dead, (some things wives may laugh at,  
but they sink deep sometimes) if you  
would cease to speak of their faults, how­  
ever hanteringly, before others, fewer wo­  
men would seek other sources of happiness  
than your apparently culd, so-so-ish affec­  
tion. Praise your wife, then, for all good  
qualities she has, and you may rest assured  
that the deficiencies are fully counterbal­

They thank the tailor for giving them ‘fits;’’ they thank the man in a full omnibus who

Soon or late to all our dwellings come the spectres of  
the mind,  
  
Doubts and fears and dread forebodings, in the dark  
peas dim-defined ;  
  
Round us threng the deep projections of the heart and  
of the brain,  
  
And our pride of strength is weakness, and the cun-  
ning hand is vain.  
  
Ia the dark we cry like children; and no answer from  
on high  
  
Breaks the crystal spheres of silence, and no white  
wings downward fly ;  
  
But the heav- nly help we pray for comes to faith and  
not to sight,  
  
And our prayers themselves drive backward ali the

She bas made your home comfortable, your |  
  
hearth brigtt and shining, your food agree-

if nothing more. She don&#x27;t expect it—it will  
mske ber eyes open wider than they have done  
for these ten years; but it willdo her good,  
for all that, and you, too.  
  
There are many wemen, to day, thirsting for  
the word of praise, the language of encourage.  
ment. Through summer’s heat and winter&#x27;s  
toll they have drudged uncomplainingly ; and  
so accustomed have their fathers, brothers, and  
husbands become to their monotonous labors,  
that they look for and upon them as they do  
the daily rising of the sun and its daily going  
down. Homely everyday life may be made  
beautiful by the appreciation of its very home-  
liness. You kaow that if the floor is clean,  
manual labor has been performed to make it  
so. You know, if you can take a clean shirt  
from your drawer whenever you want it, some-  
body’s fingers have ached in the toil of making  
it so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lus  
trous. Everything that pleases the eye and  
the sense has been produced by constant work,  
much thought, great care, and untiring efforts,  
bodily and mentally.  
  
Is it not that many men do not appreciate  
these thirgs, and feel a flow of gratitude for  
the numberless attentions bestowed upon them  
in sickness and health, that they are so selfish  
in their feeling? They don’t come out with a  
hearty, “‘ Why, how pleasant you make things  
look, wife;’”? or, “I am obliged to you for  
taking so much pains.’’ They thank the tailor  
for giving them &lt;&lt; fits ;”’? they thank the man in  
the full omnibus who gives them a seat; they  
thank the young lady who moves along in the  
concert-room; in short, they thank everybody  
and everything out of doors, because it is  
the custom, and come home, tip their chairs  
back, and their heads up, pull out the news-  
paper, grumble if wife asks them to take the  
baby, scold if the fire has gone down; or, if  
everything is just right, shut their mouth with  
a smack of satisfaction, but never say to her,  
‘¢] thaak you.”’  
  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if you  
did but show an ordinary civility towards those  
common articles of housekeeping—your wires ;  
if you gave the one hundred and sixtieth part  
of the compliments you almost choked them  
with before they were married; if you would  
stop the badinage about whom you are going to  
have when number one is dead, (such things  
wives may laugh at, but they sink deep some-  
times;) if you would cease to speak of their  
faults, however banteringly, before others—  
fewer women would seek for other sources of  
happiness than your cold, so so ish affection.  
Praise your wife, then, for all good qualities  
ste has, and you may rest assuced that her  
deficiencies are fully counterdalanced by your  
gwn.’’

your home comfortable, your hearth  
bright and shining, your food  
agreeable—for pity&#x27;s sake tell her you  
thank her, if nothing more. She don&#x27;t

wider than they have been for thirteen  
years ; but it will do her good for all

labors, that they look for and upon them

and its daily going down.—Homely every  
day life may be made beautiful by an  
appreciation of very homeliness. You  
know that if the floor is clean, manual  
labor lias been performed to make it so.  
You know if you can take from your  
drawer a clean shirt whenever you want  
it, semebody&#x27;s fingers have ached in the  
toil of making it so fresh and agreeably  
lustrous. Everything that pleases the

it will make her eyes open wider than thev i

There are many women to day thirsting  
for tho word of praise, the language of cn

Dotonous labors, that they look for and upon |  
them as they do the daily rising of the sun

Praiae jour wife, man ; for pity’s sake, give her a  
little enconragement—it wont hurt her. She has  
made yoor home comlorlable, your heart bright and

her you thank her, if nothing more. She don’t expect  
it; it will make her eyes open wider than they have

There are many women to-day thirsting for the  
word of praise, the language of enconragement.  
Through Summer’s beat and Winter’s toil they have  
drudged uncompliuningly; and so accustomed have  
their fathers, brothers, and husbands become to their  
monotonous labors, that they look for and upon them  
as they do upon the daily rising of the sun, and its  
daily going down. Homely everyday life may be  
made beautiful by an appreciation of its bomeli*  
oess. ; You know that if the floor is clean,  
man^lal labor has been performed to make it so.  
Yo^ know that if you can take fronr yonr drawer a  
iSean durt whenever you want it, somebody’s Angers

able, so fresh and lustrous. Everything that pleases  
the eye and the sense has been produced by constant  
work, much thought, great care, and untiring efforts,  
bodfly and mentally.  
  
It is not that many men do not appreciate these  
things, and feel a glow of gratitude for the numberless  
attentions bestowed upon them in sickness and in  
health; but they are so selfish in that feeling. They  
don’t come out with a hearty “ Why, how pleasant  
yon make things look, wife or, “ I am obliged to  
yon for taking so much pains.” They thank the tailor  
for giving them “ fits,” they thank the man in a full

aeold if the fire has got down; or, if everything is just  
right, shut their mouths with a smack of satisfaction  
but never say to her, “ I thank you.”  
  
I tell you what, men, young men and old, if you did  
but show an erdinary civility towards those common

one-hundred-and-sixtieth part of the compliments you  
almost choked them with before they were married  
if you would stop your badinage about who you are

After speaking, singing or preaching in  
a warm room in winter, do not leave it for  
at least ten minutes, and even then close the

peans do not dread the sun as they do on the

and in spite of my assuring him that time  
was precious, he drew me within tho gate  
of an unoccupied garden &quot;by the roadside,  
and tfiere, sheltered from observation by  
a hedgo of evergreens, he took me by the  
button of my coat, and, closing his eyes,  
commenced an eloquent discourse, waving  
his right hand gently as the musical words  
flowed in an unbroken stream from his lips.  
E listened entranced ; but the striking clock  
recalled me to a sense of duty. I saw it  
was of no use to attempt to break away ;  
so, taking advantage of his absorption in  
his subject, and, with my pen&#x27; knife, quietly  
severing a button from my coat, I decamp­

Berlin theatre got up a drama in which a

. In order to produce as much effect as pos­

&#x27; On the stage was placed a table covered  
with a cloth; on the table was a. basin,  
and an actor, concealed nnder the cloth,  
poked up his head through a hole in the  
table, so as to seem to be placed in the ba­  
&#x27; sin. The effect was prodigious ; the audi­  
ence applaned and trembled. Unluckily a  
wag, who was behind the scenes, sprinkled

served to the government and its agonts, Stanton,

Baltimore, Qft  
Editor ef Loyalist :  
Sirs On the 20tK Inst you placarded your bul­  
letin board ou Baltimore st-eet with ihe announce­  
ment, in large letters, that another draft had been  
ordered; that three hundred thousand more men  
bad been called for; that, onder the new call, the  
substitute s)item would be abolished, &amp;C. With  
these wicked falsehoods you&#x27;assoc&#x27;ated the name ot  
the Secretary of War, evidenily designing to give.  
your news an-ofBcial air. Such bold imposture in  
the beginning, sufficiently erposcs the animut with  
which yOur paper will be hereafter conducted.  
The Co valid was started by loyal men, but you.  
&#x27;. and the corps editorial at your back, are disloyalists.  
As a union paper, it obtained most ol its patronage.  
Its originators, on account of their loyalty, were  
influential enough to obtain government printing  
which helped to till up the columns of the very- i  
. &#x27;sue that contained the falsehoods in question. Is  
it tolerable that you should take pay from a gov­  
ernment of which you are such an unscrupulous  
- enemy? I do&#x27; not think so.  
You will, therefore, from this date, discontinue  
: tbe publication of the Loyalist until the war w over.  
The old conductors ot the Transcript, Bulletin,  
. ta, may is well accept notice now that they will  
. not be allowed to publish, ft paper in Baltimore, -no  
matter what &#x27;name or guise they assume.  
Very respectfully.

Tns Power op a Fues Pk ess. &#x27; Give me but  
the liberty of the Press,&quot; said Sheridan in the Brit­  
ish House of Commons in 1310, &quot;Give me but the  
liberty i-f the Presg, and I will give to the Minister  
a venal House of Peers&#x27; I will give him a corrupt  
and servile House of Commons I will give him the  
full swing oi patronage and office I will give him  
, the whole host of ministerial influence I will give  
him all the power ihat place can confer upon him  
to buy up submission and overawe resist? nee; and  
yet, armed with the liberty of the Press, I will go  
forth undismayed to mcl him ; I will tttuck with  
that mightier engine the mighty fabric he has  
raised; I&#x27; will shake down corruption from its  
height, and bury it beneath the ruins it was meant  
to shelter.&quot;  
It is conceded, wc believe, that a Despotism and  
a tree Press cannot co exist in the ssnc country.  
&#x27; Tho free Press will either overthrow tbe Govern  
ment, or the Government will put down the free  
Press. We hadever believed that, in our day, an  
attempt would be made to put d-vwn the liberty of  
&#x27; the Press until we saw it The attempt seems to  
- us sadly omuious, becau.se we have observed that  
every attempt to establish a despotism during this  
&#x27; century has been preceded by the suppression of.  
the freedom of the Prees. This is the invariable  
and inevitable precursor the flash before the clap  
the rattle of the serpent before his deadly spring.  
The suppression or the free press means the estab­  
lishment Of t despotism. Charles X. tried it pre­  
liminarily to bis attempt at despotism in lb30, and  
failed. Louis Philippe indicated his disposition to  
overthrow the liberties of Bin country by attempts  
- upon the press, and he, too, failed. Louis Napoleon  
supprevpa&#x27; the free press before be suppressed lib­  
erty. It is the premonitory symptom, always, and  
. it always gives warning of the same thing. Tbe  
picket guard must be surprised before tbe sleeping  
army can be slaughtered. The press must be si­  
lenced before liberty can be surprised. Our appre­  
hensions may not be just, but this is a sign, and a  
most fearful one.  
If the press, when free, is such a tremendous en­  
gine in the hands of those who love liberty, that the  
Bret step of every aspirant who seeks to overthrow  
the existing institutions of his country is to destroy  
its freedom, what must it be in the hands of such an  
aspirant himself? Hew long will it bo, when there  
is no free press to give the people wurning of each  
new enterprise against liberty, and when there is  
an enslaved press to represent each such enterprise  
as inspired by t)ie loftiest patriotism and the most  
consummate wisdom, beforewe shall have, not the  
present enlightened and patriotic Senate, but a ve­  
. nal, self seeking body in its place ? How lon be­  
; fore the present highly honorable body of Itepre-  
sentatives shall Jbe substituted by a corrupt and  
&#x27; servile successor 1 How long berore the enormous  
&#x27; patronage already enjoyed by the Chief Migistrate  
shall be let loose in full swing to purchase silence  
&#x27;. and overawe resistance 7 How long wilT it be be­  
. fore liberty shall be shaken from its foundation be­  
. neath tbe play of this terrific engine, and bury in

Votb or the Yankkb Navt. The New York  
&#x27; Iftrald publishes extracts from letters in respect to  
the enforcement of the Lincoln doctrines onboard  
. of the national ships. From these specimens we  
. have room for only the following:  
A letter from a sailor, dated &quot; in the James River,  
. October 21,&quot; says :  
&quot; Commissioners cameon board the various vessels  
in the river to take the voles of the crews, as they  
&#x27; said, by order of the government &quot;If a man voted  
&#x27; the Republican ticket he was furnished with State  
and Presidential ticket to forward to his agents. If  
he voted for the Democratic candidates he was told  
&#x27; there wertwio tickets for him, and he must provide  
. them himself.&quot;  
A sailor on board of the United States steamer  
Minnesota, in Hampton Roads, says :  
On the 22J all the sailors on the vessel who  
- hailed from New York and desired to vote, were  
ordered to lay aft on the quarter deck. The Com-  
niodore then descended from tbe bridge and addres­  
sed the men as follows: &quot;All who wish to vole  
the Union ticket remain aft ; all the rest can go for­  
ward out of this.&#x27; The Republican gentleman  
must have felt a little crest fallen when they per­  
ceived that all left but five. When the votes were  
. cast they amounted in all, including officers and  
men, to eleven. The crew of the vessel numbers  
seven hundred and fifty men. Lincoln runs but a  
poor chance with the navy boys, if this vessel is a  
sample.&quot;  
A sailor on board the iron clad United States&#x27;  
steamer, Roanoke, writing under date of October H  
2otn, makes . the following statement in regard to  
the management of the voting on that vessel :  
&quot;&#x27;Two army officers came on board to diy and  
managed to get ten votes for Lincoln. When the  
McCklUn men went up to vote they wgre told to  
go away ; that they might as well vote for Jeff.  
Davis. They also declared that they did not carry  
! any &#x27; outlawed ! ballots, and if the men did not liko  
. Lincoln ballots they could not vote at all&quot;  
. PRAISE YOUR WIFE.  
Praise your wife, mn for pity sike give her  
a little encouragement ; it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has  
made your home comfortable, your hearth bright  
and shining, your food &#x27;agreeable; for pity&#x27;s sake  
tell her you thank her, if nothing more. She don&#x27;t  
&#x27; expect it; it will make her eyes open wider than  
they have for these ten years; but it will do her  
good for all that, and you, too. -  
There are many women to day thirsting for tbe  
word of praise, the language of encouragement.  
Through summer&#x27;s heat and winter&#x27;s toil they have  
drudged uncomplainingly, and so accustomed have  
their fathers, brothers and husbands become to their  
monotonous labors, that they look for and upon  
tbem as they do to the daily rising of the sun and  
its daily going down. Homely every-day life may  
. bo made beautiful by an appreciation of iu very  
homeliness, You know that if yon can take from  
your drawer a clean shirt&#x27; whenever you want it,  
8omebedy&#x27;s fingers have&#x27;ached in the toll of making  
it BO fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lustrous.  
Everything that pleases the eye and sense, has been  
produced by constant work, .much thought, great­  
care, and antiring effort, bodily and mentally. &#x27;  
  
It is not that many men do not appreciate things  
  
and feel a glow of gratitude for the numberless at­  
tentions bestowed upon them in sickness and health,  
but they are so selfish. in. that reeling. Ihey don t  
come with a hearty, &quot; Why how pleasant you make  
things look, wife 1&quot; or, MIatn obliged to you for  
taking so much pains.  
They thank Ihe tailor for giving tbem &quot; fits ;&quot;  
they thank the man in full omnibus who gives them  
a seat; they thank the lady who moves a long in the  
-concert room ; they thapk everybody and every tiling  
out of doors, because it is the custom; end come  
home, tip their chairs back and theie heels up, pull  
out the newspaper, grumble if wife asks, to take  
the baby, scold if the fire has got down ; or, if every­  
thing is just right, shut their mouths with a smack  
of satisfaction, but never 6ay to her &quot; I thank you.  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if you did.  
but show ordinary civility towards those common  
articles of housekeeping, your wives ; if you gave  
the one hundred and sixtieth part of tho compli­  
ments you almost choked them with before they  
weremairied ; if you would stop&#x27; the badinage about  
whom you are going to have when number one is  
dead, such things wives may laugh at, but .they  
think deep sometimes ; if you would cease to speak  
of thir faults, however banteringly,. before others,  
few women would seek for other sources of happi­  
ness than your cold so so-ish affection. Praise  
your wife, then, for all the good qualities she has,  
and you may rest assured that her deficiencies are  
fully, counterbalanced by your own. Ercliange. &#x27;  
Common Sense. There is considerable common  
sense in the following article irom the Charlotte  
Carolina Timet- relative to the positions occupied  
by Messrs. Stephens and Boyce, and-some of the oc­  
cupants of snug bomb proof positions inSouth-Carolina  
would do well to profit by it:  
Re-Union or Rb Construction. Much is being  
said at the presentime by journalists and corres­  
pondents, in the papers of the Southern Confederacy,  
by way of criticism upon the policy suggested&#x27;by  
the Hon. W. Boyce and Vice President Stephens,  
some contending that those gentlemen, (the former  
especially,) are in favor of re-construction, which  
they interpret as meaning re union, a re establish  
ment of the old Union, and tat therefore those dis  
tinguished gentlemen are willing to sacrifice all that  
has been lost or won, and surrender to tbe North­  
ern government, at the sacrifice of principle, honor  
and property, rather tnan continue tne war as it is  
now being waged! &#x27;  
We are much surprised on. reading some of the  
criticisms, but find on the other hand that a few  
journalists and their correspondents not only defend  
the honorable gentlemen referred to, against the as  
pertions of the press, but endorse the sentiments  
expressed by Messrs. Boyce and Stephens, as not  
onlv proper but statesmanlike.  
. We regretted when we read Mr. Boyce&#x27;s letter,  
and so expressed ourself, editorially, that he re­  
garded it necessary to employ certain facts and ar  
guments to illuminate his policy, yet wc have not  
been one among those who&#x27; concluded that Mr.  
Boyce or Mr. Stephens have become -unsound ; on  
tne contrary, we are of the opinion those gentlemen  
deiignnothing more, nor would tney accept any-  
thin;; less, than an honorable settlement of our&quot; na  
tional difficulties, with the unreserved acknoweldg  
ment of ihe establishment of the government of fhe  
Confederate h&#x27;ates of America.  
Ifthewiris ever closed, that desirable . object  
will he secured in one of two ways, backed by the  
sword, viz: Diplomacy or the extermination of  
tbe people of one of the two sectious. After the  
sword has done its work, then the military chief­  
tain must stand aside and give place toDiplo-maii.sU.-ti  
adjust all differences and establish boun  
daries with a mutual agreement that there must  
be two distinct governments, each independent of  
the other yet obligated to unite, if necessary, for  
war purposes, to prevent invasion or spoliations by  
a loreign government.  
We earnestly advise our readers not to b? ton  
hasty iu making up their opinions upon this great  
question. Many who have been extremely anxious  
in giving judgment at so early a data may, before  
tbe 4th of March next, be called upon and expected  
to chance their opinions and seek counsel from  
wiser heads.  
A distinction which is not warranted by the cir­  
cumstances surrounding the two classes of. men, is  
made by the Su&#x27;gon General of North Carolina, in  
his regulation in regard to Artificial Limbs the  
private soldier and non commissioned officer to be  
supplied without expense the officer to pay prime  
coit. &#x27;  
Is not the brave officer whose limb is amputated  
after battle, as worthy and a3 meritorious as the  
private soldi&quot; r who has suffered a like misfortune f  
Should a comprehensive and enlightened policy at­  
tempt &#x27;o draw a line tf distinction between the de­  
serts of the two ? I) jcs the paltry sum of Confed­  
erate money, which the ollicer receives, counterbal­  
ance by one half nil th-j gouging he is compelled to  
undergo, while the government is making herculean  
endeavors to pet. back all it has given him? Does  
it follow as a matter of course that a man is rich, able  
to live, support bis family, and serve his country for  
rothing because he is an officer f Does the honor  
of his position which makes him a mark for the  
envy of the private, and a target for the jeers of  
demagogues does such honor pay him for his p e­  
cuniary losses, as well as for his sacrifices of com­  
fort and encounters wiih danger t Ought the poor  
devil Je compelled to buy his own Artificial Limbs?  
We know the reason for the drawing of this dis­  
tinction. Demagogues, with very few exceptions ,  
till the Legislative halls of the country. Dema­  
gogues generally pursue that course which they  
think will render them popular with rhe masses.  
Tney think that there is a feeling of enmity be  
tween the officers and their men ; and knowing that  
the men outnumber the officers they hope to win fa­  
vor with the troops by passing obnoxious laws for  
the officers. .  
This will do no longer the privates are fond of  
abusing their own officers, but are unwilling for ex  
emptt to abuse tbem ; and they feel that the men  
who have led them in battle, and shared their hard­  
ships, and encountered their dangers, deserve equal  
privileges with themselves. The day of reckoning  
will come, and all these mean tricks will be answer­  
ed for. .  
We reiterate that North-Carolina is able to give  
all her sons who bave lost legs, Artificial one3  
without prime cost or any lhing else. Xorth Car­  
olinian. .  
We think the Carolinian has done injustice to  
the Surgeon-General. He is authorized by law to  
provide for .the soldiers, but not for the. officers.  
We think, however, that the Legislature will  
provide, if it shoui be deemed practicable to maru  
ufacture or procure artificial limbs for all the sold­  
iers, that the officers who may need tbem may also be  
supplied free of chargevith the srae kind of limbs.  
There ought to be no-distinction either as to the  
provision or the kind of limbs furnished. Stan  
dard. &quot;  
Messrs. Stephens ano Bovce asd &quot; Recosstrcc­  
tion.&quot; We take it for granted that if Mr. Boyce of  
S. C, and Mr. Stephens of this State were favora­  
ble to a Peace which would not insure Independence,  
they would have the&#x27; manliness to avow their senti­  
ments in a manner that would bo unmistakable.  
Neither of the distinguished statesmen mentioned  
have uttered a word or written a line, so far as our  
observation extends and we try to keep up with  
the current events in politics which fair-minded  
and intelligent merrcan construe into ah advocacy&#x27;  
of that imaginary something which Babler Bomb  
proof and Co., have denominated &quot; Reconstruction.&quot;  
If we may judge them&#x27; by their words and by  
their acts, and we are not warranted in going be­  
yond these to look for their jnotives they advocate  
an armistice and a Convention of tho States for no  
other purpose than that of bringing the war to a  
speedy and honorable close, or, in other word, for  
a peace settlement, which trill guarantee to the  
Southern 6tates or to the Confederacy, if you pre­  
fer that rithi of self-government which Mr. Davis  
says is the-only object of the war on our part .  
Messrs. Stephens and Boyce advocate a policy  
which they conceive to be well calculated to short  
en the war,&quot; and to basten the day of our deliverance  
from Yankee domination ; and yet because the plans  
they suggest for securing- Independence and Con­  
stitutional liberty is not concurred in by Messrs. B.  
Bombproof and Co., and because the above named  
respectable firm aro the only competent judges in  
eucli matters,. Messrs. Stephens and &quot; Boyce are  
&quot;Recon8tructionists.&quot;- This seems to be abdut the  
Sum and substance of the issue.

times, and it must be so. But it by no means fol­

ed falsehoods,&quot; is free: That valuable right is re­  
served to the government and its agents, Stanton,

Baltimore, Oct 29, 1864.  
EHitonofLoyalut: -  
Sirs On tho 26th inst you placarded your bul­  
letin board on Baltimore street with the announce­  
ment, in large letters, that another draft had been  
ordered ; that three hundred thousand more men  
had been called for; that, under the new call, the  
substitute sjstem would be abolished, &amp;c With  
these wicked falsehoods you associated the name of  
the Secretary of War, evidently designing to give  
your news an official air. Such bold imposture in  
the beginning, sufficiently exposes the animut with  
which your paper will be hereafter conducted.-  
The Loyalist was started by loyal men, but you,  
and the corps editorial at your back, are disloyalists.  
As a Union paper, it obtained most of its patronage.  
Its originators, on account of their loyalty, were  
influential enough to obtain government printing  
which helped to fill up the columas of the very is­  
sue that contained the falsehoods .in question. Is  
it tolerable that you should take pay from a gov­  
ernment of which you are such an unscrupulous  
enemy ? I do not think so. . -  
You will, therefore, from this date, discontinue  
the publication of the Loyalist until the war is over.  
The old conductors ot the Transcript, Bulletin,  
  
&amp;c, may as well accept notice now that they will  
not be allowed to publish a paper in Baltimore, no  
matter what name or&#x27;guise they assume.

The Power or a Fkeb Press. &quot;Give me but  
the liberty of-the Press,&quot; said Sheridan in the Brit  
ish House of Commons in 1S1U, &quot;Give rao but the  
liberty of the Press, and I will give to the Minister  
a venal House of Peer&#x27;s I will give him a corrupt  
and servile ITouse of Commons I will give him the  
full swing of patronage and office I will &#x27;give him  
the whole host of ministerial influence I will give  
him all the power that place can confer upon him&#x27;  
to buy up submission and oyerawe resistance ; and  
yet, armed with the hbcrty of the Press, I will go  
tortn undismayed to meet turn ; 1 win auacic wnn  
that mightier engine the mighty fabric he has  
raised ; 1 will shake down corruption from its  
height, and bury it beneath the ruins it was meant  
to shelter.&quot;  
It is conceded, we believe, that a Despotism &#x27;and  
a free FVvss cannot co-exist in the same country.  
TUe free Press will either overthrow the Govern  
ment, ot the Government will put down the free  
Press. We had never believed that, in our day, an  
attempt would be made to put down the liberty of  
the rress until we saw it The attempt seems to  
us sadly omnious, because we have obsrrved that  
every attempt to establish a despotism during this  
century has been preceded by the suppression of  
tho freedom of tue Press. This is the invariable.  
and inevitable, precursor the flash before the clap  
the rattle of the serpent before his deadly spring.  
Ilie suppression of the free press means tho estab­  
lishment of a despotism. Charles X. tried it pre­  
liminarily to his attempt at despotism in 1830, and  
failed Louis .Philippe indicated bis cisposi&#x27;ion to  
overthrow the liberties of his country by attempts  
uportthe press, and he, too, failed. Louis napoleon  
suppressed the free press before he suppressed lib­  
erty. It is the premonitory-symptom always, and  
it always give warning of the same thing. The  
picket guard must be surprised before the sleeping  
army can be slaughtered. The press must be si­  
lenced before liberty can be surprised. Our appre  
hensions may not be just, but this is a sign, and a  
most fearful one.  
If the press, when free, is such a tremendous en  
gine in the hands of those who love liberty, that the  
first Kte.n of everv nsnir.mt who sepks to overthrow  
the existing institutions of his country is to destroy!  
its freedom, what must it be in the hands of such an  
aspirant himself? How long will it bo, when there  
is no free press to give the people warning of each  
new enterprise against liberty, and when there is  
An enslaved press to represent each such enterprise  
as inspired by the loftiest patriotism and the most  
consummate wisdom, before&#x27;we fhall have, not the  
present enlightened and patriotic Senate, but a ve­  
nal, self-seeking body in its place ? How long be­  
fore the present highly honorable body&#x27; of Repre­  
sentatives shall be substituted by a corrupt and  
servile successor ? How long before the enormous  
patronage already enjoyed by the Chief Magistrate  
shall be let loose in full swing to purchase silence  
and overawe resistance? How long will it be be­  
fore liberty shall be shaken from its foundation be­  
neath the play of this terrific engine, and bury in  
its ruins all the fair fruits of a four years&#x27; struggle?  
Richmond Whig. . . -  
Votr or the Yankee Navy. The New York  
Jlerald publish extracts from letters in respect to  
the enforcement of the Lincoln doctrines on board  
of tho national ships. From these specimens we  
have room for only the following:  
A letter from a sailor, dated &quot;&#x27;in the James River,  
October 21,&quot; says :  
&quot; Commissioners came on board the various vessels  
in the river to take the votes of the crews, as they  
said, by order of tho government. If a man voted  
the Republican ticket be was furnished with State  
and Presidential ticket to-forward to his agents. If  
he voted for the Democratic candidates he was told  
there were no tickets lor him, and he must provide  
them himself.&quot;  
A sailor on board of the United States&#x27; Steamer  
Minnesota, in Hampton Roads, says:  
On the 22tl all the sailors on the vessel who  
hailed from New York and desired to vote, were  
ordered to lay aft on the quarter deck. The Com­  
modore then descended from the bridge and addres­  
sed the men as follows : &quot; All who wish to vote  
the Union ticket remain aft; all the rest can go for­  
ward out of this.&quot; The Republican gentleman  
must have felt a little crest fallen when they per­  
ceived that all left but five. When the votes were  
cast they amounted in all, including officers and  
men, to eleven. The crew of the vessel numbers  
seven hundred and fifty men. Lincoln runs but a  
poor chance with the navy boys, if this&#x27; vessel is a  
sample.&#x27;-&#x27;  
A sailor on board the iron clad United States&#x27;  
steamer, Roatfoke, writing tinder date of October  
25th, makes the following statement in regard to  
tha management of the voting on that vessel :  
u Two army officers cime on board to day and  
managed to get ten votes for Lincoln. When the  
McClellan men went up to vote they were told to  
go away ; that they might as well vote for Jeff.  
Davis. They also declared that they did not carry  
any &#x27; outlawed ballots, and if the men did not like  
Lincoln ballots they could not vote at alU&quot;  
PRAISE YOUR WIFE. .  
Praise your wife, man for pity sake give her  
a little encouragement ; it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has  
made your home comfortable, your hearth bright  
and shining, your food! agreeable ; for- pity&#x27;s sake,  
tell her you thank her, if nothing more.- Sue don&#x27;t  
expect it ; it will make her eyes open wider than  
they have for these ten years; but it will do her.  
good for all that, and you, too.  
There are many women to-day thirsting for the  
word of praise, the language of encouragement.  
, Through summer&#x27;s heat and winter&#x27;s toil they have  
drudged uncomplainingly, and so accustomed have  
their fathers, brothers and husbands become to their  
monotonous labors, that they look for and upon  
them as they do to the daily rising of the sun and  
its daily going down. Homely everyday life may  
bo made beautiful by an appreciation of its very  
homeliness. You know that if you can take from  
your drawer a clean shirt whenever you want it,  
somebody&#x27;s fingers have ached in the toil of making  
it so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lustrous.  
Everything that pleases the eye and sense, has been  
produced by constant work, much thought, great  
care, and untiring efforts, bodily and mentally.  
  
It is not that many men do not appreciate things  
and feel a glow of gratitude for- the numberless at­  
tentions bestowed upon them in sickness and health,  
but they are so selfish in that feeling. They don&#x27;t&#x27;  
come with hearty, &quot; Why how pleasant you make  
things look, wife 1&quot; or, &quot;lam obliged to you for  
taking so much pains.&quot;  
They thank the tailor for giving them &quot; fits ;&quot;  
they thank the man in full omnibus who gives them  
a seat; they thank the lady who moves a long in the  
concert room ; they thank everybody and everything  
out of doors, because it is the custom ; and come  
home, tip their chairs back and their heels up, pull  
out the newspaper grumble if wife asks to take  
the baby, scold if the fire has got down ; or, if every­  
thing is just right, shut their mouths with a smack  
of satisfaction, but never say to her &quot; I thank you.&quot;  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if you did  
but show ordinary civility towards those common  
articles of housekeeping, your wives ; if you gave  
the one hundred and sixtieth part of the compli­  
ments you almost choked them with before they  
were married ; if you wouldstop the badinage about  
wbom you are going to have when number one is  
dead, such things wives may laugh at, but they  
think deep sometimes ; if you would cease to cpeak  
of their faults, however banteringly, -before others,  
few women would seek for other sources of happi­  
ness than your cold so so-ish affection. Praise  
your wife, then, for all the good quallities she has,  
and you may rest assured that her deficiencies are  
fully counterbalanced by your own. Exchange.  
  
.Common Sense. Thero is considerable common  
sense in the following article irom the-Charlotte  
Carolina Times relative to the positions- occupied  
by Messrs. Stephens and Boyce, and some of the oc­  
cupants of snug bomb proof positions inSouth-Carolina  
would do well to profit by it:  
. Re-Union ob Re Construction. Much is being  
said at the -present time by journalists and corres­  
pondents, in the papers of the Southern Confederacy,  
by way of criticism upon the policy suggested by  
the Hon. W. W. Boyce and Vice President Stephens,  
some contending that those gentlemen, (the former  
especially,) are in favor of re-construction, which  
they interpret as meaning re-union, are-establish-ment  
of the oid Union, and that therefore those dis­  
tihuiished gentlemen are willing to sacrifice all that  
hasocen lost or won, and surrender to the North­  
ern government, at the sacrifice of principle, honor  
and properly, rather than continue the war as it is  
now being waged.  
We are much surprised on reading some of -the  
criticisms, but find on the other band that a few  
journalists and their correspondents not only defend  
the honorable gentlemen referred to, against the as­  
pcrtions of the press, but endorse the sentiments  
expressed by Messrs. Boyce and Stephens, as not  
only prcper but statesmanlike.  
We regretted when we read Mr. Boyce&#x27;s letter,  
and so expressed ourself, editorially, that he re­  
garded it necessary to employ certain facts and ar­  
guments to illuminate his policy, yet we have not  
been one among those who concluded that Mr.  
Boyce or Mr. Stephens have become unsound ; on  
the contrary, we are of the opinion those gentlemen  
design nothing more, nor would they acceptany-thin-;  
less, than an honorable settlement of our na­  
tional difficulties, with the unreserved acknoweldg­  
ment of the establish mept of the government of the  
Confederate States of America.  
- If the war is ever closed, that desirable object  
will be secured in one of two ways, backed by the  
sword, viz:. Diplomacy or the extermination of  
the people of one of the two scctious. After the  
sword has done its -work, then the military chief­  
tain must stand aside and give place to Diplo.­  
matists to adiust all differences and establish boun  
daries with a mutual agreement that there musf  
be two distinct governments, each independent of  
the other yet obligated to unite, if necessary, for  
war purposes, to prevent invasion-or spoliations by  
a foreign government .&#x27;  
We earnestly advise our readers not to ba too  
hasty in making up their opinions upon this great  
question. Many who have been extremely anxious  
in giving judgment at so early a data may, before  
the 4th of March next, be called upon and expected  
to change their opinions and seek counsel from  
wiser beads.  
A distinction which is not warranted by the cir­  
cumstances surrounding the two classes of men, is  
made by the Surgeon General of North-Carolina, in  
his regulation in regard to Artificial Limbs the  
private soldier and non commissioned officer to be  
supplied without expanse the officer to pay primt  
eoit.  
Is not the brave officer whose limb is amputated  
after battle, as worthy and as meritorious as the  
privnte soldiir who has suffered a like misfortune ?  
Should a comprehensive and enlightened policy at­  
tempt to draw a line.of distinction between the de­  
serts of the tvro ? Does the paltry sum of Confed­  
erate money, which the officer receives,counter-balance  
by one half all the gouging be is compelled to  
undergo, while the government is making herculean  
endeavors to get back all it has given him ? Docs  
it follow as a matter of conrsc that aman is rich, able  
to live, support his family, and serve his country for  
ruihing because he is an officer ? Does the honor  
of his position which makes him a mark for the  
envy of the private, and a target for th6 jeers of  
demagoguesdoes such honor pay. him for his pe­  
cuniary losses, as well as, for his sacrifices of com­  
fort and encounters with danger ? Ought the poor  
devil be compelled to buy his own Artificial Limbs ?  
We know the reason for the drawing of this dis­  
tinction. Demagogues, with very few exceptions,  
fill the Legislative halls of the country. Dema­  
gogues generally pursue that course which they  
think will render them popular with the masses.  
They think &#x27; that there is a feeling of enmity be­  
tween the- officers and their men ; and knowing that  
the-men outnumber the officers they hope to win fa­  
vor with the troops by passing obnoxious laws for  
the officers. &#x27;  
This will do no longiipu-the privates are fond of  
abusing their own officers, but are unwilling for ex­  
empts to abuse their. ; and tbey feel &quot; that the men  
who have led them in battle, and shared their hard­  
ships, and encountered their dingers, deserve equal  
privileges with themselves. The day of reckoning  
will come, and all these mean tricks will be answer­  
ed for.  
We reiterate that North-Carolina is able to give  
all her sons who, have lost legs, Artificial ones  
without 2rimo cott or any thing else. JSorln Var­  
olii.ian.We think tho Chrolinian has done injustice to  
the-Surgeon-General. He is authorized by law to  
provide tor the soldiers, but not lor the officers.  
We think, however, that the Legislature will  
prpvjde, if it should be deemed practicable to man  
ufacture or procure artificial limbs for all the sold  
iers, that the officers who may need them may also be  
supplied tree of charge with the same kind of limbs.  
There ought to be no distinction either as to the  
provision or the kind of limbs furnished. Stan  
dard.  
Stephens and Boyce and &quot; Reconstruc  
tion.&quot; We take it for granted that .if Mr. Boyce of  
a. t., sno sir. Stephens cf this State were favora  
ble to aPeace which would hot insure Independence,  
tbey would have the manliness&#x27; to avow uPir senti  
ments in a manner that would be unmistakable.  
Neither of the distinguished statesmen mentioned  
have ottered ,a word or written a line, so far as our  
observation extends and we try to keep up with  
the carrent events in politics which fair-minded  
ana intelligent men can-construe. into an aJvocacy  
of that imaginary something which Babler Bomb­  
proof -and Co., have denominated &quot;Reconstruction.&quot;  
If we may judge them by their words and by  
tneir acts, and we are not warranted, in coins be  
yond these to look for their motives they advocate  
an armistice and a Convention of the States, for no  
other purpose than that of bringing the war to a  
speedy and honorable closa. or, in other words for  
a peace- .settlement, which will guarantee to the  
Southern States or to the Confederacy, if you pre  
fer that riht of self-government which Mr. Davis  
says is the only object of the war on our part.  
Messrs. Stephens and Boyce advocate a policy  
wnicn they conceive to be well calculated to short  
en the war, and to hasten the day of our deliverance  
irom x ankee domination ; and yet because the plans  
tbey suggest tor securing Independence and Uoj  
r stitutional liberty is not concurred in by Messrs.  
Bombproof and Co., and because the above named  
respectable hrna are the only competentjudges in  
such matters, Messrs. Stephens .and .Boyce are  
&quot;Reeonstructionists.&quot; This seems to be about the  
sum ana substance of the issue.

The mother turned away and wept bitterly. At  
length she took her husband by the hand and said:  
  
“Rabbi, didst thou not teach me that we must not  
be reluctant to restore that which was intrusted to our  
keeping? See, the Lord gave, and the Lord taketh  
away, and blessed be the name of the Lord.”  
  
“Blessed be the name of the Lord!’’ echoed Rabbi  
Meir; “and blessed be his name for thy sake, too, for  
well is it written, ‘Whoso hath found a virtuous wife  
hath a greater treasure than costly pearls. She open-  
eth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the  
law of kindness.’ ”  
  
PRAISE youR WiFe.—Praise your wife, man; for  
pity’s sake give her a little encouragement; it won&#x27;t  
  
  
  
hurt her. She makes your home comfortable, your  
hearth bright and shining, your food agreeable—for  
pity’s sake tell her you thank her, if nothing more.  
She don’t expect it; it will make her eyes open wider  
than they have these ten years, but it will do her  
good for all that, and you too.  
  
There are many women to-day thirsting for the  
words of praise, the language of encouragement.  
Through Summer&#x27;s heat, through Winter&#x27;s toil, they  
have drudged uncomplainingly, and so accustomed  
have their fathers, brothers, and husbands become to  
their monotonous labors, that they look for and upon

performed to make it so. You know if you can take  
from your drawer a clean shirt whenever you want it,  
that somebody’s fingers have ached in the toil of mak-  
ing it so fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lustrous.  
Every thing that pleases the eye and the sense has  
been produced by constant work, much thought, great  
care, and untiring efforts, bodily and mental.  
  
It is not that many men do not appreciate these  
things, and feel a glow of gratitude for the numberless  
attentions bestowed upon them in sickness and in  
health, but they do n’t come out with a hearty, “ Why,  
how pleasant you make things look, wife!” or, “I am  
obliged to you for taking so much pains!” They thank  
the tailor for giving them “ fits;” they thank a man in  
a full omnibus who gives them a seat: they thank a  
young lady who moves along in the concert-room—in  
short, they thank every thing out of doors, because it  
is the custom, and come home, tip their chair back and  
their heels up, pull out the newspaper, grumble if their  
wife asks them to take the baby, scold if the fire has  
gone down, or if every thing is just right, shut their  
mouths with a smack of satisfaction, but never“say,  
“T thank you.”

don&#x27;t expect it; it will make her eyes  
open wider than they have these ten  
years, but it will do her good for all that  
and you too.  
There are many women, to day, thirst.  
ing for the word of praise, the language  
of encouragement. Through summer&#x27;s  
heat, through winter&#x27;s toil, they have  
drudged uncomplainuingly, and so ac  
customed lrave theiv fothons, bue thoen,  
 and nusbands become to their monoton.  
ous labors, that they look for and upon  
them as they do the daily rising of the  
sun and its dailv going down. Home  
every dav may be made beautiful by an  
appreciation of holiness. You know  
that if the floor is clean, manual labor has  
been performed to make it so. You  
know, if you can take from your drawer  
ale  
neboly  
fin  
ers have arched in the  
toil of making it so fresh and agrecable,  
so smooth and lastrous. Everything  
that pleases the eve and the sense ha  
been produced by constant work much  
thought, great care, and untiring efforts,  
bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appre  
ciate these things, and feel a glow of  
gratitude for the numberless attentions  
lestowed upon them in sickness and in  
health, but they don&#x27;t come out with a  
hearty- &quot;Why, how pleasant you make  
things look, wife!&quot; or, &quot;I am obliged to  
vou for taking so much pains; They  
thank the tailor for giving then, &quot;fits,&quot;  
they thank a man in a full omnibus who  
gives them a seat; they thank a young  
lady who moves along in the concert  
room--in short, they thank everybody  
out of doors, because it is the custom, and  
come home, tip their chair back and their  
heels up, pull out the newspaper, grum-  
ble  
their wife asks them to take the  
baby, scold if the fire has gone down  
or, if everything is just right, shut their  
mouth with a smack of satisfaction, but  
never say, &quot;I thank you.&quot;  
I tell you what, men, young and old,  
if you did but show an ordinary civility  
toward those common articles of house­  
keeping, your wives, if you would give  
them the hundred and sixteenth part of  
the compliments you almost choked them  
with, before you were married, fewer wo-  
ee eo oe ee eee oeee

the good qualities she has, and you may

Praiso your wife, man ; for pity&#x27;s sako

You know that, if the floor is clean,  
manual labor has&#x27; been&#x27; porformod to  
make it so. You know, if you oan take  
from your drawer aclean shirt whenever  
you want it, that somebody&#x27;s fingers  
have toiled in making it so fresh and  
agreeable, so smoothe and lustrous.  
Everything that pleases the oyo and tho  
Bense has beou produced by constant  
work, much thought, great care, and  
uutuing efforts, bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not ap  
preciate theso things and feel a glow of  
gratitude for the numberless attentions  
bestowed upon them in sickness and  
health ; but they dou&#x27;t oomo out with a

There are many women to-day thirst­

of encouragement. Through summer’-n  
heat, and wintet&#x27;s toil, they have  
drudged uncomplainingly, and so ac­  
customed have their fathers, brother&#x27;],  
and husbands become to their monot«i  
nous labor, that they look for and npoiji  
them as they do upon the daily rising  
of the sun and its daily going dowij.  
Homely, every-day life may be madi­  
beautiful by an appreciation of its veiT  
homeliness. You know that if tlij­

performed to make it so. You kno*  
that if you can take from your drawer  
a clean shirt whenever you want is,  
somebody’s fingers have ached in tin­  
toil of making it so fresh and agrees*­

thing that pleases the eye and the sen^  
has been produced by constant workj  
much thought, great care and untirinjS  
efforts, bodily and mentally. It is n&lt;7  
that many men do not appreciate thesj­  
things, and feel a glow of gratitude for  
the numberless attentions be»towt«&lt;jl

Praise your wife, man?do, for pity&#x27;s sake,  
give her a little encouragement. You may  
be assured it won&#x27;t hurt her. She has made  
your house comfortable, your hearth bright

sake, tell her you thank her, if nothing more.  
She don&#x27;t expect it. It will make her eyes  
open wider than thev have been for this ten  
years, but it will do her good for all that, and  
you, too.  
There are many women to-day thirsting  
for the word of praise, the language of encouragement.  
Through summer&#x27;s heat, through  
winter&#x27;s cold, they have drudged uncomplainingly,  
and so accustomed are their fathers,  
brothers and husbands become to their monotonous  
labors, that they look for and upon  
them as they do the daily rising of the sun  
and its daily going down.  
Homely, every-day life may be made beautiful  
by an appreciation of its very homeliness.  
You are aware that, if the floor is clean,  
manual labor has been performed to make it  
so. You know that, if you can take from  
your drawer a clean shirt whenever you want  
it, somebody&#x27;s Angers have ached in the toil  
of making it so fresh and agreeable, so smoth  
and lustrous. Everything that pleases the  
eye and the sense has been produced by constant  
work, much thought, great care and untiring  
efforts, bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appreciate  
these things and feel a glow of gratitude for  
the numberless attentions bestowed upon them

Irbit there is one at Minalinsk--which  
likewise inconvenienced me in travel­

year at various places, all having refer­  
ence to the great fair at Nijni. The

Praise Your WIFe.  
Praise your wife, man; for pity&#x27;s  
sake give her a word of encourage­

your home comfortable, your hearth  
shining and bright, your food agreea­

pect it; it will make her eyes open  
wider than they have been for ten  
years; but it will do her good, for all  
that, and you too.  
There are many women to-day thirst­  
ing for the word of praise, the language  
of encouragement. Through summer&#x27;s  
heat and winter&#x27;s cold they have drudg­  
ed uncomplainingly, and so accustom­  
ed have their fathers, brothers and  
husbands become to their monotonous  
labors, that they look for and upon  
them as they do the daily rising of the  
sun, and its daily going down. Home­  
ly, every day life, may be made beau­  
tiful by an appreciation of its very  
homeliness. You know that if the  
floor is clean, manual labor has been  
done to make it so. You know that if  
you can take from your drawer a clean  
shirt whenever you want it, some­

There are some kind of bills every day,  
Like a patient horse in a tread-mill,  
He works on from morning till night,  
Does any one think he is tired,  
Does any one make his home bright.  
Is it right just because he looks troubled,  
To say he’s as cross as a bear?  
Kind words, little actions of kindness,  
Might banish his burden of care.

He will toil for you while he may live,  
In return he only asks kindness,  
And such pay is easy to five.

 Idea.  
Praise your wife, man; for pity&#x27;s sake give  
her a little encouragement; it won&#x27;t hart  
her. She made your home comfortable,  
your heart bright andßhining; food agree­  
able. For pity&#x27;s sake tell her you thank her,  
if nothing more. She don&#x27;t expect it; it will  
make her eyes open wider than they have  
these 10 years, but it will do &#x27;her good, and  
yon, too.  
There are many women to day thirsting  
for words of praise, the language of encour­  
agement Through summer&#x27;s heat, through  
winter&#x27;s toil, they have drudged uncom­  
plainingly, and so accustomed have their  
fathers, brothers and husbands become to  
their monotonous labors that they look for  
and upon them as they do the daily rising  
of the sun and its daily goiDg down. Home  
every day may be made beautiful by an  
appreciation of its holiness. You know, if  
you can take from your drawer a clean shirt  
whenever you want it that somebo-iy&#x27;s  
fingers have ached in the toil of making it  
fresh and agreeable, so smooth and lustrous.  
Everything that pleases the eye and sense  
has been produced by constant work, much  
thought, great care and untiring efforts,  
bodily and mentally.  
It is not that many men do not appreciate  
these things and feel a glow of gratitude for  
numberless attentions bestowed upon them,  
in sickness and in health, but they doü&#x27;t  
come with a hearty &#x27;&#x27;Why, how pleasant you  
make things look, wife,&quot; or &quot;I am obliged to  
you for taking so much pains.&quot; They thank  
the tailor for their &quot;fits;&quot; they thank a man  
in a full omnibus who gives them a seat;  
they thank a young lady who moves along  
in a concert room in short they, thank­  
everybody out of doors because it is  
the custom, and come home, tip their  
chairs back, and tneir heels up, and pull out  
the newspaper; grumble if their wife asks  
them to take the bdby, sold if the fire has  
gone down, or, if everything is just right,  
shut their mouths with a snap of satisfaction,  
but never say. &quot;I thank you.&quot;  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if  
you do but show ordinary civility to those  
common articles of housekeeping, your  
wives, if you would give them the hundred  
and sixteenth part of tbe compliments you  
almost choked them with before you were  
married, fewer women would seek for other  
sources of afiection. Praise your wife, then,  
for all the good qualities she has, and vou  
may rest assured that her deficiencies are  
counterbalanced by your own.

PRAISE YOUR WIFE.  
  
Praise your wife, man; for pity’s sake give  
her a little encouragement: it won&#x27;t hurt her.  
She has made your home comfortable. your  
hearth bright, your food agreeable: for pity’s  
sake tell her you thank her, if nothing more.  
She don’t expect it: it will make her eyes open  
wider than they have for these last ten years;  
but it will do her good for all that, and you, too.  
  
There are many women to-day thirsting for a  
word of praise,—the language of encourage-  
ment. Through summer&#x27;s heat and winter&#x27;s  
  
toil they have drudged uncomplainingly, and so |  
  
accustomed have their fathers, brothers, and  
husbands become to their labors, that they look  
  
for and upon them as they do the daily rising  
of the sun and its daily going down. You  
know that, if the floor is clean, labor has been  
performed to make it so. You know that, if  
you can take from your drawer a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, somebody&#x27;s fingers have  
toiled. Everything that pleases the eye and  
the sense has been produced by work, thought,  
care, and efforts, bodily and mental.  
  
Many men appreciate these things, and feel  
gratitude for the numberless attentions be-  
stowed upon them in sickness and health; why  
don’t they come out with a hearty ‘* Why, how  
pleasant you make things look, wife,” or ** Tam  
obliged to you for taking so much pains.” They  
thank the tailor fora good fit: they thank the  
man in the horse car who gives them a seat;  
they thank the young lady who moves along in  
a concert-room; in short they thank everybody  
and everything out-of-doors, and come home,  
tip their chairs back and their heels up, pull out  
the newspaper, scold if the fire has got down;  
or, if everything is just right, shut their mouths  
with a smack of satisfaction, but never say ‘1  
thank vou.”  
  
I tell you what, men, young and old, if you  
did but show an ordinary civility toward your  
wives; if you gave one hundred and _ sixtieth  
part of the compliments you almost choked  
them with before they were married: if you  
would stop the badinage about whom you are  
going to have when number one is dead (such  
things wives may laugh at, but they sink deep,  
sometimes); if you would cease to speak of  
their faults, however banteringly, before others,  
  
— fewer women would seek for other sources of |  
  
happiness. Praise your wife, then, for all her  
good qualities, and you may rest assured that  
her deficiencies are no greater than your own.

Praise Your Wife.  
  
Praise your wife, man; for pity’s sake  
give her a little encouragement; it won’t  
hurt her. She has made your home  
comfortable, your heart bright, your  
lood agreeable; for pity’s sake tell her  
you thank her, if nothing more. She  
don’t expect it; it will make her eyes  
open wider than they have for these  
last ten years; but it will do her good  
tor all that and you, too.  
There are many women to-day thirst­  
ing for a word of praise—the language  
of encouragement. Through summer’s  
heat and winter’s toil they have drud­  
ged uncomplainingly, and so accustom­  
ed have their fathers, brothers, and  
husbands become to their labors, that  
they look for and upon them as they do  
the daily rising of the sun and its daily  
going down. You know that if the  
door is clean, labor has been performed  
to make it so. You know that if you  
can take from the drawer a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, somebody’s  
lingers have toiled. Everything that  
pleases the eye and sense has been pro­  
duced by work, thought, care and ef­  
forts, bodily and mental.  
Many men appreciate these things  
and feel gratitude for the numberless  
attentions bestowed upon them in sick­  
ness and health; why don’t they come  
out with a hearty. “Why, how pleas­  
ant you make things look, wife,” or “1  
am obliged to you for taking so much  
pains.” They thank the tailor for a  
good tit; they thank the man in the  
horse car, who gives them a seat; they  
thank the young lady who moves  
along in the concert room; in short they  
thank everybody and everything out­  
of-doors, and come home, tip their  
chairs hack and their heels up, pull out  
the newspaper, scold if the fire has gone  
down; or if everything is just right,  
shut their mouths with a smack of  
satisfaction, but never say “1 thank  
you.”  
I tell you what, men, young and old,  
if you did but show the ordinary civil­  
ity toward your wives; if you gave one  
hundred and sixtieth part of the com­  
pliments you almost choked them be­  
fore they were married; if you would  
stop the badinage about whom you are  
going to have when the number one  
is dead (such things wives may laugh  
at, but they sink deep, sometimes); if  
you would cease to speak of their  
faults, however banteringly, before  
others—fewer women would seek for  
other sources of happiness. Praise  
your wife, then, for all her good quali­  
ties, and you may rest assured that her  
deficiencies are no greater than your  
own.—The Homestead.

PRAISE YOUR WIFE. Praise your wife, man;  
for pity&#x27;s sake, give her a little  
encouragement-it won&#x27;t hurt her. She  
made your home comfortable, your hearth  
bright and shining, food agreeable-for  
pity&#x27;s sake, tell her you thank her, if  
nothing more. She don&#x27;t expect it; it  
will-make her eyes open wider than they  
have these ten years, but it will do her  
good, and you too. There are many women  
to-day thirsting for words of praise,  
the language of encouragement; Through  
summer&#x27;s heat, through winter&#x27;s toil,  
they have drudged uncomplainingly, and  
so accustomed have their fathers,  
brothers, and husbands becomne to their  
monotonous labours that they look for  
and upon them as they do the daily  
rising of the sun,oand its daily going  
down. Home every day maybe made  
beautiful by a appreeiation of its  
holiness. You know, if the floor is  
clean, manual labour has been  
performedtomake it so. Youknow,if you  
can take from your:drawer a clean shirt  
whenever you want it, that somebody&#x27;s  
fingers have ached in the toil of making  
it fresh and agreeable, so smooth and  
lustrous. Everything that pleases the  
eyeand sense has been produced by  
constant work, much thought, great  
care,, and untiring efforts, bodily and  
mentally. It is not that many men do not  
appreciate these things, and feel a  
gtowe of gratitude for numberless  
attentions bestwed upon them in sickness  
and in health, but they don&#x27;t come with  
a hearty &quot; Why, how pleasant you make  
thiogs look, wife l&quot; or, &#x27; Pm obliged to  
you for taking so much pains.&quot; They  
thank the tailor for their Sfits;&quot; they  
thank a man in a fall omnibus who gives  
them a seat: they thank a young lady who  
moves along in a conoert-room--i short,  
they thank everybody out of doors,  
beause itis the custom; and tome home,  
tip their chairs hack and their heels  
up, and pull out the newspapers; grumble  
if their wife asks them to take the  
baby, scold if the fire has gone down,  
or, if everything is just right, shut  
their mouthr witha snap of satisfaction,  
but never say, &quot;I thankyou.&quot; I tell you  
what, men, young and old, if you do but  
show ordinary civility to those common  
articles of housekeeping, your wives, if  
you would give them the hundred-and-  
sixteenth part of the compliments you  
almost choked them with before you were  
married, fewerwomen would seek for other  
sources of affection. Praise your wife,  
then for all the gook qualities she has,  
and you may rest assure; that her  
deficiencies are coanterbalanced bh&#x27;  
Tour own.
