ears to have had both the earlier full preface and The Gentleman’s Magazine’s shortened version before him. Most notably, he restored some, though not all, of the uses of “as Poor Richard says,” and, apparently liking the expression, added it or similar words several times when they are not found in the original. The differences from the magazine text are numerous enough to make clear that it was this text which was used in most of the later English-language printings or translations. The new title was obviously suggested by two sentences near the end of Franklin’s “Advice to a young Tradesman” (1748): “In short, the Way to Wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the Way to Market. It depends chiefly on two Words, Industry and Frugality.”

aham’s speech in all its different forms in unknown thousands of copies—and the publishers, at least, have profited from their enthusiasm.  
As to the speech itself, one may agree with D. H. Lawrence that Poor Richard’s “tags” are detestable, or with Franklin’s Scottish admirer that these proverbs are “the quintessence of the wisdom accumulated in all the ages,” or one may take a position somewhere in between. In any case, one can recognize the skill with which Franklin wove his maxims together into a connected discourse, and appreciate the fun he had doing it while on his long voyage to England.  
  
Courteous Reader,  
I have heard that nothing gives an Author so great Pleasure, as to find his Works respectfully quoted by other learned Authors. This Pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for tho’ I have been, if I may say it without Vanity, an eminent Author of Almanacks annually now a full Quarter of a Century, my Brother Authors in the same Way, for what Reason I know not, have ever been very sparing in their Applauses; and no other Author has taken the least Notice of me, so that did not my Writings produce me some solid Pudding, the great Deficiency of Praise would have quite discouraged me.  
I concluded at length, that the People were the best Judges of my Merit; for they buy my Works; and besides, in my Rambles, where I am not personally known, I have frequently heard one or other of my Adages repeated, with, as Poor Richard says, at the End on’t; this gave me some Satisfaction, as it showed not only that my Instructions were regarded, but discovered likewise some Respect for my Authority; and I own, that to encourage the Practice of remembering and repeating those wise Sentences, I have sometimes quoted myself with great Gravity.  
Judge then how much I must have been gratified by an Incident I am going to relate to you. I stopt my Horse lately where a great Number of People were collected at a Vendue of Merchant Goods. The Hour of Sale not being come, they were conversing on the Badness of the Times, and one of the Company call’d to a plain clean old Man, with white Locks, Pray, Father Abraham, what think you of the Times? Won’t these heavy Taxes quite ruin the Country? How shall we be ever able to pay them? What would you advise us to? ——Father Abraham stood up, and reply’d, If you’d have my Advice, I’ll give it you in short, for a Word to the Wise is enough, and many Words won’t fill a Bushel, as Poor Richard says. They join’d in desiring him to speak his Mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows;  
  
“Friends, says he, and Neighbours, the Taxes are indeed very heavy, and if those laid on by the Government were the only Ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to some of us. We are taxed twice as much by our Idleness, three times as much by our Pride, and four times as much by our Folly, and from these Taxes the Commissioners cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an Abatement. However let us hearken to good Advice, and something may be done for us; God helps them that help themselves, as Poor Richard says, in his Almanack of 1733.  
It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People one tenth Part of their Time, to be employed in its Service. But Idleness taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent in absolute Sloth, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in idle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. Sloth, like Rust, consumes faster than Labour wears, while the used Key is always bright, as Poor Richard says. But dost thou love Life, then do not squander Time, for that’s the Stuff Life is made of, as Poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in Sleep! forgetting that The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry, and that there will be sleeping enough in the Grave, as Poor Richard says. If Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest Prodigality, since, as he elsewhere tells us, Lost Time is never found again; and what we call Time-enough, always proves little enough: Let us then be up and be doing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more with less Perplexity. Sloth makes all Things difficult, but Industry all easy, as Poor Richard says; and He that riseth late, must trot all Day, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night. While Laziness travels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him, as we read in Poor Richard, who adds, Drive thy Business, let not that drive thee; and Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy and wise.  
So what signifies wishing and hoping for better Times. We may make these Times better if we bestir ourselves. Industry need not wish, as Poor Richard says, and He that lives upon Hope will die fasting. There are no Gains, without Pains; then Help Hands, for I have no Lands, or if I have, they are smartly taxed. And, as Poor Richard likewise observes, He that hath a Trade hath an Estate, and He that hath a Calling hath an Office of Profit and Honour; but then the Trade must be worked at, and the Calling well followed, or neither the Estate, nor the Office, will enable us to pay our Taxes. If we are industrious we shall never starve; for, as Poor Richard says, At the working Man’s House Hunger looks in, but dares not enter. Nor will the Bailiff nor the Constable enter, for Industry pays Debts, while Despair encreaseth them, says Poor Richard. What though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left you a Legacy, Diligence is the Mother of Good luck, as Poor Richard says, and God gives all Things to Industry. Then plough deep, while Sluggards sleep, and you shall have Corn to sell and to keep, says Poor Dick. Work while it is called To-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered To-morrow, which makes Poor Richard say, One To-day is worth two Tomorrows; and farther, Have you somewhat to do To-morrow, do it To-day. If you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, be ashamed to catch yourself idle, as Poor Dick says. When there is so much to be done for yourself, your Family, your Country, and your gracious King, be up by Peep of Day; Let not the Sun look down and say, Inglorious here he lies. Handle your Tools without Mittens; remember that the Cat in Gloves catches no Mice, as Poor Richard says. ’Tis true there is much to be done, and perhaps you are weak handed, but stick to it steadily, and you will see great Effects, for constant Dropping wears away Stones, and by Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Cable; and little Strokes fell great Oaks, as Poor Richard says in his Almanack, the Year I cannot just now remember.  
Methinks I hear some of you say, Must a Man afford himself no Leisure? I will tell thee, my Friend, what Poor Richard says, Employ thy Time well if thou meanest to gain Leisure; and, since thou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour. Leisure, is Time for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will obtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as Poor Richard says, a Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two Things. Do you imagine that Sloth will afford you more Comfort than Labour? No, for as Poor Richard says, Trouble springs from Idleness, and grievous Toil from needless Ease. Many without Labour, would live by their WITS only, but they break for want of Stock. Whereas Industry gives Comfort, and Plenty, and Respect: Fly Pleasures, and they’ll follow you. The diligent Spinner has a large Shift; and now I have a Sheep and a Cow, every Body bids me Good morrow; all which is well said by Poor Richard.  
  
But with our Industry, we must likewise be steady, settled and careful, and oversee our own Affairs with our own Eyes, and not trust too much to others; for, as Poor Richard says,  
  
I never saw an oft removed Tree,  
Nor yet an oft removed Family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.  
  
And again, Three Removes is as bad as a Fire; and again, Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee; and again, If you would have your Business done, go; If not, send. And again,  
  
He that by the Plough would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.  
  
And again, The Eye of a Master will do more Work than both his Hands; and again, Want of Care does us more Damage than Want of Knowledge; and again, Not to oversee Workmen, is to leave them your Purse open. Trusting too much to others Care is the Ruin of many; for, as the Almanack says, In the Affairs of this World, Men are saved, not by Faith, but by the Want of it; but a Man’s own Care is profitable; for, saith Poor Dick, Learning is to the Studious, and Riches to the Careful, as well as Power to the Bold, and Heaven to the Virtuous. And farther, If you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serve yourself. And again, he adviseth to Circumspection and Care, even in the smallest Matters, because sometimes a little Neglect may breed great Mischief; adding, For want of a Nail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for want of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by the Enemy, all for want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail.  
So much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one’s own Business; but to these we must add Frugality, if we would make our Industry more certainly successful. A Man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, keep his Nose all his Life to the Grindstone, and die not worth a Groat at last. A fat Kitchen makes a lean Will, as Poor Richard says; and,  
  
Many Estates are spent in the Getting,  
Since Women for Tea forsook Spinning and Knitting,  
And Men for Punch forsook Hewing and Splitting.  
  
If you would be wealthy, says he, in another Almanack, think of Saving as well as of Getting: The Indies have not made Spain rich, because her Outgoes are greater than her Incomes. Away then with your expensive Follies, and you will not have so much Cause to complain of hard Times, heavy Taxes, and chargeable Families; for, as Poor Dick says,  
  
Women and Wine, Game and Deceit,  
Make the Wealth small, and the Wants great.  
  
And farther, What maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children. You may think perhaps, That a little Tea, or a little Punch now and then, Diet a little more costly, Clothes a little finer, and a little Entertainment now and then, can be no great Matter; but remember what Poor Richard says, Many a Little makes a Mickle; and farther, Beware of little Expences; a small Leak will sink a great Ship; and again, Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove; and moreover, Fools make Feasts, and wise Men eat them.  
Here you are all got together at this Vendue of Fineries and Knicknacks. You call them Goods, but if you do not take Care, they will prove Evils to some of you. You expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may for less than they cost; but if you have no Occasion for them, they must be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard says, Buy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy Necessaries. And again, At a great Pennyworth pause a while: He means, that perhaps the Cheapness is apparent only, and not real; or the Bargain, by straitning thee in thy Business, may do thee more Harm than Good. For in another Place he says, Many have been ruined by buying good Pennyworths. Again, Poor Richard says, ’Tis foolish to lay out Money in a Purchase of Repentance; and yet this Folly is practised every Day at Vendues, for want of minding the Almanack. Wise Men, as Poor Dick says, learn by others Harms, Fools scarcely by their own; but, Felix quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautum. Many a one, for the Sake of Finery on the Back, have gone with a hungry Belly, and half starved their Families; Silks and Sattins, Scarlet and Velvets, as Poor Richard says, put out the Kitchen Fire. These are not the Necessaries of Life; they can scarcely be called the Conveniencies, and yet only because they look pretty, how many want to have them. The artificial Wants of Mankind thus become more numerous than the natural; and, as Poor Dick says, For one poor Person, there are an hundred indigent. By these, and other Extravagancies, the Genteel are reduced to Poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised, but who through Industry and Frugality have maintained their Standing; in which Case it appears plainly, that a Ploughman on his Legs is higher than a Gentleman on his Knees, as Poor Richard says. Perhaps they have had a small Estate left them, which they knew not the Getting of; they think ’tis Day, and will never be Night; that a little to be spent out of so much, is not worth minding; (a Child and a Fool, as Poor Richard says, imagine Twenty Shillings and Twenty Years can never be spent) but, always taking out of the Meal-tub, and never putting in, soon comes to the Bottom; then, as Poor Dick says, When the Well’s dry, they know the Worth of Water. But this they might have known before, if they had taken his Advice; If you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for, he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing; and indeed so does he that lends to such People, when he goes to get it in again. Poor Dick farther advises, and says,  
  
Fond Pride of Dress, is sure a very Curse;  
E’er Fancy you consult, consult your Purse.  
  
And again, Pride is as loud a Beggar as Want, and a great deal more saucy. When you have bought one fine Thing you must buy ten more, that your Appearance may be all of a Piece; but Poor Dick says, ’Tis easier to suppress the first Desire, than to satisfy all that follow it. And ’tis as truly Folly for the Poor to ape the Rich, as for the Frog to swell, in order to equal the Ox.  
  
Great Estates may venture more,  
But little Boats should keep near Shore.  
  
’Tis however a Folly soon punished; for Pride that dines on Vanity sups on Contempt, as Poor Richard says. And in another Place, Pride breakfasted with Plenty, dined with Poverty, and supped with Infamy. And after all, of what Use is this Pride of Appearance, for which so much is risked, so much is suffered? It cannot promote Health, or ease Pain; it makes no Increase of Merit in the Person, it creates Envy, it hastens Misfortune.  
  
What is a Butterfly? At best  
He’s but a Caterpillar drest.  
The gaudy Fop’s his Picture just,  
  
as Poor Richard says.  
But what Madness must it be to run in Debt for these Superfluities! We are offered, by the Terms of this Vendue, Six Months Credit; and that perhaps has induced some of us to attend it, because we cannot spare the ready Money, and hope now to be fine without it. But, ah, think what you do when you run in Debt; You give to another Power over your Liberty. If you cannot pay at the Time, you will be ashamed to see your Creditor; you will be in Fear when you speak to him; you will make poor pitiful sneaking Excuses, and by Degrees come to lose your Veracity, and sink into base downright lying; for, as Poor Richard says, The second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt. And again, to the same Purpose, Lying rides upon Debt’s Back. Whereas a freeborn Englishman ought not to be ashamed or afraid to see or speak to any Man living. But Poverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: ’Tis hard for an empty Bag to stand upright, as Poor Richard truly says. What would you think of that Prince, or that Government, who should issue an Edict forbidding you to dress like a Gentleman or a Gentlewoman, on Pain of Imprisonment or Servitude? Would you not say, that you are free, have a Right to dress as you please, and that such an Edict would be a Breach of your Privileges, and such a Government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put yourself under that Tyranny when you run in Debt for such Dress! Your Creditor has Authority at his Pleasure to deprive you of your Liberty, by confining you in Goal for Life, or to sell you for a Servant, if you should not be able to pay him! When you have got your Bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of Payment; but Creditors, Poor Richard tells us, have better Memories than Debtors; and in another Place says, Creditors are a superstitious Sect, great Observers of set Days and Times. The Day comes round before you are aware, and the Demand is made before you are prepared to satisfy it. Or if you bear your Debt in Mind, the Term which at first seemed so long, will, as it lessens, appear extreamly short. Time will seem to have added Wings to his Heels as well as Shoulders. Those have a short Lent, saith Poor Richard, who owe Money to be paid at Easter. Then since, as he says, The Borrower is a Slave to the Lender, and the Debtor to the Creditor, disdain the Chain, preserve your Freedom; and maintain your Independency: Be industrious and free; be frugal and free. At present, perhaps, you may think yourself in thriving Circumstances, and that you can bear a little Extravagance without Injury; but,  
  
For Age and Want, save while you may;  
No Morning Sun lasts a whole Day,  
  
as Poor Richard says. Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever while you live, Expence is constant and certain; and ’tis easier to build two Chimnies than to keep one in Fuel, as Poor Richard says. So rather go to Bed supperless than rise in Debt.  
  
Get what you can, and what you get hold;  
’Tis the Stone that will turn all your Lead into Gold,  
  
as Poor Richard says. And when you have got the Philosopher’s Stone, sure you will no longer complain of bad Times, or the Difficulty of paying Taxes.  
This Doctrine, my Friends, is Reason and Wisdom; but after all, do not depend too much upon your own Industry, and Frugality, and Prudence, though excellent Things, for they may all be blasted without the Blessing of Heaven; and therefore ask that Blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remember Job suffered, and was afterwards prosperous.  
And now to conclude, Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools will learn in no other, and scarce in that; for it is true, we may give Advice, but we cannot give Conduct, as Poor Richard says: However, remember this, They that won’t be counselled, can’t be helped, as Poor Richard says: And farther, That if you will not hear Reason, she’ll surely rap your Knuckles.  
  
Thus the old Gentleman ended his Harangue. The People heard it, and approved the Doctrine, and immediately practised the contrary, just as if it had been a common Sermon; for the Vendue opened, and they began to buy extravagantly, notwithstanding all his Cautions, and their own Fear of Taxes. I found the good Man had thoroughly studied my Almanacks, and digested all I had dropt on those Topicks during the Course of Five-and-twenty Years. The frequent Mention he made of me must have tired any one else, but my Vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, though I was conscious that not a tenth Part of the Wisdom was my own which he ascribed to me, but rather the Gleanings I had made of the Sense of all Ages and Nations. However, I resolved to be the better for the Echo of it; and though I had at first determined to buy Stuff for a new Coat, I went away resolved to wear my old One a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the same, thy Profit will be as great as mine. I am, as ever, Thine to serve thee,  
Richard Saunders.

Curious preltminary addrefs prefixed to  
the Penfylvania almanac^ entitled Poor  
Richard improved: For the year 1758.  
  
Courteous Reader^  
  
Have heard that nothing gives an an*  
thor lb great plealure, as to find his  
works relpedfully quoted by other learn¬  
ed autliors. This pleafurc I have Iddom  
enjoyed; for though I have been, if I may  
lay it without vanity, an eminent author  
(of almanacs) annually now a full quar¬  
ter of a century, my brother authors in  
the fame way, for what reafoii I know  
not, have ever been very (paring in their  
applaulcs: and no other author has ta¬  
ken the lead notiee of me; lb that did  
not my writings produce me lume Iblid  
pudding, the great deficiency of praile  
would have quite dilcouraged me.  
  
I concluded at length, that the people  
were the bed judges of my merit; for  
they buy my works; and b^des, in my  
rambles,wherel am notperfonally known,  
1 have frequently heard one or other of  
my adages repeated, with, as poor Ri¬  
chard fays, at the end on’t; this gave me  
foine fatisfaflion, as it (hewed not only  
that my indriiAions were reg.arded, but  
dilcovered likewile Ibme rdpcdl for my  
authority; and 1 own, that to encourage  
the pra(dice of remembering and repeat¬  
ing thofc wile lentences, I have fometimes  
quoted my (elf with great gravity.  
  
Judge then liow much I mud have been  
gratified by an incident I am going to re¬  
late to you. I dopt my horfe lately where  
a great number of people were collected  
at an auflion of merchant-goods. The  
hour of fate not being come, they were  
converfingon the badnefs of the times, and  
one of the company called to a plain clean  
old man, with white locks, “ Pray, fa¬  
ther Abraham, what think you of the  
times Won’t thefe heavy taxes quite  
ruin the country ? How (hall we be ever  
able to pay them ? What would you ad-  
vife us to .-Father Abraham dood up,  
and replied, “ If you’d have my advice.  
I’ll give it you in lliort, for a word to the  
VOL. U.  
  
to the Penfylvania almanac. 131  
  
wife is enough, and many words won’t  
fill a bulhel, as poor Richard lays.” They  
joined in defiring him to (peak his mind,  
aud gathering round him, he proceeded as  
follows :  
  
Friends, fays he, and neighbours, the  
taxes are indeed very heavy, and if thofe  
laid on by the government were the only  
ones we had to pay, we might more eafi-  
ly difeharge them ; but we have many  
others, and much more grievous to feme  
of us ; We are taxed twice as much by  
our idlcnefs, three times as much by our  
pride, and four tinaes as much by our fol¬  
ly ; and from thele taxes the commiilion-  
ers cannot eafe or deliver us by allowing  
an abatement. However, let us hearken  
to good advice, and Ibmething may be  
done for us; God helps them that help  
themfelves,” as poor Richard lays, in his  
almanac of 17^^.  
  
It would be thought^ard government  
that (hould tax its people one tenth part  
of their time, to be employed in its fer-  
vice: but idlenefs taxes many of us much  
more, if we reckon all that is fpent in ab-  
folute (loth, or doing ol&#x27;nothing, with  
that which is fpent in idle employments,  
or amufements that amount to nothing.  
Sloth, by bringing on difealcs, abfolutcly  
Ihortens life. “ Sloth, like rulf, con-  
fumes fader than labour wears, while the  
nfed key is always bright,” as poor Ri¬  
chard fays. ** But dbll thou love life,  
then do not fquander time, for that’s the  
ftulF life is made of,” as poor Richard  
fays.-~-How much more than is nccelfaiy  
do we fpend in deep! forgetting that  
  
the lleeping fox catches no poultry,  
and that there will be deeping enough in  
the grave,” as pool* Richard fays. ” If  
time be of all things the moll precious,  
walling time mull be,” as poor Richard  
fays, ” the greatcll prodigality,” fince, as  
he elfewhere tells us, Loll time is ne¬  
ver found again; and what we call time-  
enough, always proves little enough  
Let us then up and be doing, and doing  
to the purpolc ; lb by diligence (hall we  
do more with Icis perplexity. “ Sloth  
makes all things dillicuit, butindudry all  
caly,” as poor Richard fays; and “He  
that rifeth late, mud trot all day, and  
diall fcarce overtake his bufinefs at night.

Wiliile lazineis travels fo (lowly, that po&gt;  
verty (bon overtakes him,” as we read  
(0 poor Richard, who adds, Drive thy  
hulinels, let not that drive thee; and  
early to hed, and early to rife, makes a  
tnan healthy, wealthy, and wile.”  
  
So what Cgnifies wilhing and hoping  
for better times ?. We may make thefe  
times better if we beftir ourfclves. “ In-  
dnllry needs not wi(h,” as poor Richard  
fays, and he that lives upon hope will  
die failing. There are no gains, without  
pains t then help hands, for 1 have no  
lands, or if I have, they are fmartly tax¬  
ed.” And, as poor Richard likewife ob-  
lerves, ** He that hath a trade hath an e-  
ilate ; and he that hath a calling hath an  
office of profit and honour;” but then  
the trade mud be worked at, and the  
calling well followed,, or neither the e-  
(late, nor the offi^ will enable us to pay  
our taxes.—If indudrious we (hall  
  
never darve; for, as poor Richard fays,  
f&#x27;Atthe workingman’s houfe hunger looks  
in, but dares not enter.’’ Nor will the  
bailiff or the condable enter, for Indu-  
ftry pays debts, while delpair encreafeth  
them.” What though you have found  
no treafure, nor has any rich relation left  
you a legacy, ** Diligence is the mother  
of good-lucK, and Gc^ gives all things to  
indudry. Then plough deep, while (lug-  
^rds deep, and you (hall have corn to  
(ell and to keep,’i fays poor Dick. Work  
while it is called to day, for you know  
pot how much you may be hindered to¬  
morrow, wliich makes poor Richard fay,  
♦‘ One to-day is worth two to-morrows;”  
and farther, Have you fomewhat to do  
to-morrpw, do it to-day.” If you were  
a fervant, would you not be a(hamcd  
that a gopd mailer (hould catch you idlel  
Are you then your own mader, “ be a-  
(liamed tp catch ypnvfelf idle,” as poor  
Dick lays. When there is fo much to be  
done for yourfclf, your family, your coun¬  
try, and your gracious King, be up by  
j eep of day; “ Let not the fup look down  
and fay. Inglorious here he lies.’.’ Han-  
  
t lle your tools without mittens; remem*  
&gt;cr “ that the cat in gloves catches no  
mice.’! It is true there is much to be  
dune, and perhaps vou are weak-handed ;  
but tQ it dcadily, and you will f^c  
  
Penfyhama almanac, Vol. ii,  
  
great elTedls, “ for condant dropping wears  
away dones, and by diligence and pati¬  
ence the moufe ate in two the cable;  
and little drokes fell great oaks,” as poor  
Richard fays in his almanac, the year I  
cannot jud now remcmlier.&quot;  
  
Methinksl hear Tome of you fay, “ Muft  
a man alTord liimfelf no leifure ?”—I will  
tell thee, my friend, what poor Richard  
(ays, “ Employ thy time well if thou  
meaned to gain leifure ; and, (ince thou  
art not fure pf a minute, throw not away  
an hour.”. Leifure is timp for doing  
(bmething ufeful; this leifure the diligent  
man will obtain, but the lazy man ne¬  
ver : fo that, a life of leifure and a life of  
lazincls are two things. Do you imagine  
that (loth will afford you more comfort  
than labour J No, for, as poor Richard  
lays, “ Trouble fprings from idlenels,  
and grievous toil from needled eafp. Ma¬  
ny, without labour, would live by their  
wits only, but tliey break for want of  
dock :” whereas indudry gives comfortj  
and plenty, and refpedl: “ Fly pleafures^  
and they will follow you. The diligent  
(pinner has a large (hift; and now I have  
a (beep and a cow, every body bids me  
good morrow all which is well (aid by  
poor Richard.  
  
But with our indudry, we mud like¬  
wife be deady, fettled, and careful, and  
overfee our own affairs with our own eyes,  
and not trud too much to others; for,  
as poor Richard fays, ;  
  
“ I never faw an oft removed tree, I  
  
“ Nor yet an oft removed family, I  
  
“ I&#x27;hat throve fo well as thofe that fettkd be.V  
  
And again, “ Three removes is as bad as ,  
a fire ;’’ and again, “ Keep thy (hop, and  
thy (hop will keep theeand again,  
  
“ If you would have your bufinefs done,  
go ; if not, fend.” And again,  
  
*&#x27; He that by the plough would thrive,  
  
“ Himfeli&#x27; mull either hold or drive.”  
  
And again, The eye of a mader will dp  
more work than both his hands;” and  
again, “ Want of care does us more da¬  
mage than want of knowledge;” and a-  
gain, “Not to ovcrl&#x27;ee workmen, is to  
leave them your purfe open.” Trufting  
too much to others care is the ruin of ma¬  
ny ; for,, as the almanac fays, “ In the  
‘ affair^  
  
April 17 PreKmingry addrefs  
  
affairs of this world, men are lkved&gt; not  
by faith, but by the want of itbut a  
man’s own care is profitable : for faith  
poor Dick,&#x27; “ Learning is to the Ihidibus,  
and riches to the careful, as well as power  
to the bold, and heaven to the virtuous.”  
And farther^ ** If you Would haVe a  
faithful (errant^ and one that you like,  
ferve yourfelf.” And again he advifeth  
to circumlpe^o&#x27;n and care&gt; even in the  
linallefl matters, becaufe fometimes, ** A  
little negleifl may breed great mifchicf  
adding, “ For want of a nail the fhoc  
was loft : for want of a fhoe the horle  
was loft i and for want of a horfe the  
rider was loft,” being overtaken and flain  
by the enemy, all for want of care about  
a horfe&gt;fhoe nail.  
  
So much for induftry, my friends, and  
attention to one’s own bufinefs; but to  
thefe we muft add frugality, if we would  
make our induftry more certainly fuccefs-  
flil. A man may, if he knows not how  
to fave as he gets, ** Keep his nofe all his  
life to the grindftone, and die not worth  
, a groat at laft. A fat kitchen makes  
a lean will&gt;” a) poor Richard Tap; and,  
  
*&#x27; Many eflatet are fpent in the getting,  
  
“ Since women for tea forfook fpinning arid  
  
knitting,  
  
*&#x27; And men for punch forfook hewing and fplit-  
  
ling.  
  
“ If you would be wealthy,” fays he, in  
another almanac, “ think of laving ds  
Well as of getting t the Indies have not  
made Spain rich, becaufe her outgoes are  
greater than her incomes.”  
  
Away then with your expenfive follies,  
and you will not have fo much caufe to  
Complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and  
chargeable families; for, as fbor Dick  
fays,  
  
“ Women and wine, gathe and deceit,  
  
&quot; Make the wealth fmall, and the wants great.”  
  
And farther, “ What maintains one vice,  
would bring up two children.” You may  
think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a  
little punch now and then, diet a little  
more coftly, cloaths a little finer, and a  
little entertainment now and then, can  
be no great matter; but remember what  
poor Richard fays, ** Many a little makes  
I meilileand farther, “ beWarc of little  
  
/o the Penfyhanla almanac. 133  
expences ; a fmall leak will fink a great  
Ihip and again, “ Who dainties love,  
lhail beggars proveand moreover,  
** Foojs make feails, and wile men eat  
them.”  
  
Here ybu are all got together at this  
auiftion of fineries and knick-nacks. You  
call them goods, but if you do not take  
care, they will prove evils to fome of you*  
You expc&lt;ft tliey will be Ibid cheap, and  
perhaps they may for lefs than they coft?  
but if ydu have no occafion for them&gt;  
they muft be dear to you; Rennember  
what poor Richard fays, “ Buy what  
thou haft no need of, and ere long thou  
lhalt fell thy neceflaries.” And agabj  
“ At a great peuuywortli paufe a while:”  
He means, that perhaps the cheapncls is  
apparent only, and not real; or the bar¬  
gain, by ftraitning thee in thy bullncis)  
may do thee more harm than good. For  
iri anothet place he fa^s, ** Many have  
been ruined by buying good penny¬  
worths*” Again, poor Richard fays,  
“ ’Tis foolifh today out money in a pur*  
chale of repentance and yet this tblty  
is praJlifed every day at auctions, for  
want of minding the almanac. “ Wife  
men,” aS po6r Dick fays, “ Icam by ci¬  
thers harms, fbols fcarcely hy their own;  
but, fsiix quftn faciunt alier.a perkula  
enutum.” Many a one, for the lake of  
finery pn the back, have gone with a hun¬  
gry belly, and halfrtarvedthtirfaniilie.s;  
“ Silks and lattins, fcarlet and velvets,”  
as poor Richard fays, “ put out the kitch¬  
en fire.” Thele arc not the ncceHui ies of  
life ; they can fcarccly be called the Con-  
vcniencies, and yet only becaufe they  
look pretty, how many want to have  
them r  
  
The artificial wants of mankind thin  
become more numerous than the natural;  
and, as poor Dick favi, “ For one poor  
jierfon, there arc an liiindrcd indigent.”  
By thefe, and other extravagances, the  
genteel are reduced to poverty, and for¬  
ced to borfow of thole whom they Ibr-  
merlv defpiled, but who throunli indulliy  
and frugality have maintained their ftaiui-  
ing; in which cafe it appears plainly,  
that a “ Ploughman on his legs is higher  
than a gentleman on Ids krccs,” as poor  
Richard favs. Perhaps thev have haii a  
‘ K 3 ‘ IhuU  
  
134 Prelinitnary addrefs to the Penfyhanta almanac* Vol. ii.  
  
fiiiali eftate left them which they knew  
not the getting of; they think “ &#x27;Tis  
day, and will never be nightthat a  
little to be fpent out of fo much, is not  
worth minding ; “ A child and a fool,”  
as poor Richard fays, ** imagine twenty  
fliillings and twenty years can never be  
fpent; but, always taking out of the meal  
tub, and never putting in, foon comes to  
the bottom then, as poor Dick fays.  
When the well is dry, they know the  
worth of water.” But this they might  
have known before, if they had taken his  
advice : ** If you would know the value  
of money, go and try to borrow fome;  
for he that goes a borrowing goes a lbr&gt;  
rowingand indeed fo does he that  
lends to fuch people, when he goes to  
get it in again.—Poor Dick farther ad*  
vifes, and fays,  
  
&quot; Fond pride of drefs, is fure a very curft;  
  
*&#x27; Ere fancy yon confult, confult your purie.  
  
And again, ** Pride is at loud a beggar  
as want, and a great deal more faucy.”  
When you have bought one fine thing  
you muu buy ten more, that your appear*  
ance may be all of a piece; but poor  
Dick fays, It is eafier to fupprefs the  
firfl defire than to Iktisfy all that follows  
it.” And it is as truly fully for the poor  
to ape the rich, as the frog to fwell, in  
order to equal the ox.  
  
Great eflates may venture more,  
  
“ But little boats ihould keep near ftiorc.”  
  
It is however a folly foon punifhed j for  
** Pride that dines on vanity fiips on  
contempt,” as poor Richard fays. And  
in another place, Pride breakfafied with  
plenty, dined with poverty, and fupped  
with infamy.” And after all, of what  
ufe is this pride of appearance, for which  
lb much is rilked, fo much is fuffered i It  
cannot promote health, or eafe pain ; it  
makes no iucreafe of merit in the perfon,  
it creates envy, it hallens misfortune.  
  
&#x27;• WTiat is a butterfly ? At beft  
“ He’s but a caterpillar drefl,  
  
“ The gaudy fop’s his piAure juft;”  
  
as poor Richard lays.  
  
But what madnels mud it be to run in  
debt for thefe fuperfluities ! We are of¬  
fered, by tlit terms of this auflion, fix  
  
months credit; and that perhaps bas in*  
duced fome of us to attend k, t^aufe we  
cannot fpare the ready money, and hope  
now to be fine without it. But ah! thi^  
what you do when you run in debt; yo«  
give another power over your liberty.  
If you cannot pay at the time, you will  
be aihamed to lee your creditor; yoa  
will be in lear when you fpeak to him;  
you will make poor pitiful fneakin|  
exculSs, and by degrees come to lole  
your veracity, and wik into bafe down,  
right lying ; for, as poor Richard lays, i  
** The fecond vice is lying, tlie firil b  
running in debt.” And again, to the lame  
purpole, y Lying rides upon debt’s back.”  
Whereas a lieeborn Englilhman ought  
not to be afhamed or afraid to lee or  
Ipeak to any man living : but poverty  
often deprives a man of ail fjxrit and vir.,  
tue : It is hard for an empty bag to j  
Hand upright,” as poor Richard truly  
fays. What would you think of that  
prince or that government, who Ihoold  
ilTue an edkt forbidding you to drels like  
a gentleman or a gentlewoman, on pain &gt;,  
of impriibnment or fervitude ? Would !  
you not fay, that you are free, have a i  
right to drels as you pleale, and that fucli I  
an edidl would be a breach of your pri¬  
vileges, and fuch a gotemment tyranoi -1  
cal; And yet you are about to put your-  
Iclf under that tyranny when you run it  
debt for fuch drefs 1 Your creditor has au¬  
thority at his pleafure to deprive you of&#x27;  
yeur liberty, by confining you in gaol  
for life, or by felling you for a fcrvant,j  
if YOU Ihould not be able to pay him.|  
Wiicn you have got your bargain, yoil  
may, perhaps, think little of payment;!  
but “ Creditors,” poor Richard tells is,  
  
“ have better memories than debtors;&quot;  
and in another place fays, “ Crediton  
are a fupcrftitious left, great obferveni  
of let days and times.” The day coma  
round before you are aware, and the (k-i  
mand is made before you are prepared to  
fatisfy it. Or if you bear your debt in  
mind, the term which at firft leemcd lb  
long, will, as it lellens, appear extreiw-  
ly Ihort. Time will Iceni to have addoi  
wings to his heels as w-ell as (houlders;  
** Thofe have a Ihort lent,” faith poa  
Richard, “ who owe money to be paiH  
  
atj  
  
April 1758. Ohfervations  
  
at Eafter.” TTien fince, as he lays, “ the  
borrower is a Have to the lender, and the  
debtor to the creditor,” dildain the chain,  
prefcrve your freedom, and maintain  
your indej^ndency ; be induftrious and  
tree; be frugal and free. At prefent,  
perhaps, you may think yourlelf in thri¬  
ving circutnftanccs, and that you can bear  
a little extravagance without injury; but,  
“ For age and want, fave while you may;  
  
&#x27;* No morning liin lads a whole day,”  
as poor Kithard fays—Gain may be tem-  
  
[ lorary and uncertain, but ever while you  
ive, expence is conftant and certain ;  
and “ ’tis ealier to build two chimneys  
than to keep one in fuel,” as poor Ri¬  
chard lays. ** So rather go to bed flip*  
perlefs than rife in debt.”  
  
** Get what you can, and what you once get hold;  
** ’I&#x27;is the (tone that will turn all your lead into  
gold  
  
as poor Richard fays. And when you  
have got the philofopher’s Itone, fure you  
will no longer complain of bad times, or  
the difficulty of paying taxes.  
  
This doSrine, my friends, is reafon and  
wifdom i but alter all, do not depend too  
much upon your own indullry, and fhi-  
gality, and prudence, though excellent  
things: for they may all be blafted with¬  
out the blefling of heaven; and therefore  
alk that blefling humbly, and be not un¬  
charitable to thofe that at prelent feem  
to want it, but comfort and help them.  
Remember Job fuflered, and was after¬  
wards profperous.  
  
And now to conclude, ** Experience  
keeps a dear fchool, but fools will learn  
in no other, and Icarce in that; tor it is  
true, we may give advice, but we can¬  
not give condud,” as poor Richard fays:  
however, remember this, “ They that  
won’t be counlellcd, can’t be helped,” as  
poor Richard lays: and farther, “ That  
if you will not hear realbu, Ihe’ll furc-  
ly rap your knuckles.”  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his  
harangue. The people heard it, and ap.  
proved the duarine, and immediately  
pradifed the contrary, jufl as if it had  
bten a common fermon ; for the auction  
opened, and they began to buy extrava¬  
gantly, notwithftanding all his cautions,  
and their own tear of taxes.—! found the

Curious preliminary Addrefs prehxed  
  
tothe PENSYLVANIA ALMANAC,  
entitled PooR RICHARD improved:  
For the Year 1758.  
  
Printed at Philadelphia.  
  
CourRTEOUS READER,  
  
HAVE heard that nothing gives an  
author fo great pleafure, as to find  
his works refpectiully quoted by other  
Jearned authors. This pleafure { have  
feldom enjoyed ; for tho’ I have been,  
if 1 may fay it without vanity, an emi-  
nent author (ofalmanacs) annually now  
afull quarter of acentury, my brother  
authors in the fame way, for what rea-  
fon I know not, have ever been very  
fparing in their applaufes; and no o-  
ther author has taken the leaft notice  
of me, fo that did not my writings pro-  
duce me fome folid pudding, the great  
deficiency of praife would have quite  
difcouraged me.  
I concluded at Jength, that the peo-  
  
ple were the belt judges of my merit; /  
  
for they buy my works, and befides, in  
my rambles, where I am not perfonal-  
ly known, I have frequently heard one  
or other of my adages repeated, with,  
as poor Richard fays, at the end on’t ;  
this gave me fome fatisfaétion, as it  
fhewed not only that my inftructions  
were regarded, but difcovered likewife  
fome refpec&amp;t for my authority; and I  
own, that to encourage the practice of  
remembring and repeating thofe wife  
fentences, I have fometimes quoted  
myfelf with great gravity.  
  
Judge then how much I muft have  
been gratified by an incident I am go-  
  
‘ing to relate to you. I ftopt my horfe-  
  
lately where a great number of people  
were collected at a vendue of merchant’s  
goods, The hour of fale not being  
come, they were converfing on the  
badnefs of the times, and one of the  
company called toa plain ‘clean old  
man, with white locks, “ Pray father  
“ Abraham, what think you of the  
“times? Won’t thefe heavy taxes  
“ quite ruin the country.? How fhall  
“ we beever able to pay them ? What  
  
  
  
N E  
  
1758. 306  
  
“* would you advife us to’’? Father 4-  
brabam {tood up and replied, * If you&#x27;d  
“‘ have my advice, I&#x27;ll give it you in  
“ fhort, for a word to the wile is e+  
“ nough, and many words won’t fill a  
“ buthel,” as poor Richard fays. They  
joined in defiring him to {peak his  
mind, and gathering round him, he  
proceeded as follows :  
  
Friends, fays he, and neighbours,  
the taxes are indeed very heavy: an  
if thofe laid on by the govertment  
were the only ones we bad to pay, we  
might more eafily difcharge them; but  
we have many others, and much more  
grievous to fome of us. We are tax-  
ed twice as much by our idlenefs, three  
times as much by our pride, and four  
times as much by our folly, and from  
thefe taxes the commifhoners cannot  
eafe or deliver us by allowing an a-  
batement. However, let us hearken to  
good advice, and fomething may be  
done for us; ‘* God helps them that  
“help themfelves”, a: poor Richard  
ays, in his almanac of 1733.  
  
_ It would be thought a bard govern-  
ment that fhould tax its people one  
tenth part of their time, to be employ-  
ed in its fervice. But idlenefs taxes  
many of us much more, if we reckon  
all that is {pent in abfolute floth, or  
doing of nothing, with that which is  
{pent in idle employments or .amufe-  
ments, that amount to nothing. Sloth,  
by bringing on difeafes, abfolutels  
fhortens life. ‘ Sloth, like ruft, con-  
‘¢ fumes fafter than labour wears, while  
“the ufed key is always bright, as  
“¢ poor Richard fays. But doit thoa  
‘¢ love life, then do not fquander time,  
“-for that’s the {tuff life is made of,  
“as poor Richard fays.—How much  
more than is neceflary do we {pend in  
fleep ! forgetting that, ** The epics  
‘“fox catches no poultry, and that  
“‘ There will be fleeping enough in the  
“ grave,” as poor Kichard favs. ** If  
“ time be of all things the molt preci-  
“ous, waiting time muft be, as poor  
““ Richard fays, the greatelt prodigali-  
“6 ty,” fince as he elfewhere tells us,  
“ Loft time is never found again; and

The  
  
“ what we call time enough, always  
« proves little enough: Let us then  
up and be doing, and doing to the pur-  
pofe; fo by diligence fhall we do more  
with iefs perplexity. ** Sloth makes  
« all things difficult, but indultry cafy,  
“ gs poor Richard fays; and he that  
é rifeth late, mult trot all day, and  
« thall fcarce overtake his bufinefs at  
“night. While lazinefs travels fo  
% lowly, that poverty foon overtakes  
“him,” as we read in poor Richard,  
who adds, “ drive thy bulinefs, let not  
“ that drive thee; and early to bed,  
“ and early to rife, makes a man heal-  
* thy, wealthy and wife.”  
  
So what fignifies wifhing and hoping  
for better times ? We may make thefe  
times better if we beftir ourfelves.  
¢ Induftry need not wilh, as poor Ri-  
‘* chard fays, and he that lives upon  
“ hope will die fafting. There are no  
“gains, without pains; then help  
‘¢ hands for I have no lands,” or if I  
have they are {martly taxed. And as  
poor Richard likewife cbjerves, “* He  
‘¢ that hath a trade hath an eltare, and  
“ he that hath a calling hath an office  
‘¢ of profit and honour ;”” but then the  
trade mult be worked at, and the call-  
ing well followed, or neither the eltate,  
nor the office, wilienable us to pay our  
taxes. —If we are indultrious we fhall  
never ftarve ; for, as poor Richard fays,  
«¢ At the working man’s houfe hunger  
*¢ looks in, but dares not enter.” Nor  
  
406  
  
- &amp; will the bailiff or the conftable enter,  
  
for, ‘‘ Indultry pays debts, while de-  
‘¢ fpair increafeth them,” fay: poor Ri-  
chard,—What though you have found  
no treafure, nor has any rich relation  
left you a legacy, ‘* Diligence is the  
  
* motber of good luck, as poor Ri-  
  
“ chard fays, and god gives all things  
**to induftry. Then plough deep,  
“* while fluggards fleep, and you fhall  
** have corn to f:1l and to keep,” /ays  
posr Dick. Work while it is called to  
day, for you know not how much yoa  
may be hindered to morrow, which  
makes poor Rivhaid fay, “ One to-day  
‘Cis worth two to-morrows ;” and far-  
  
GENERAL MAGAZINE  
  
ther, “* Have you fomewhat to do to.  
‘‘ morrow, do it to-day.” If you were  
a fervant, would you not be afhamed ,  
good matter fhould catch you idie? Are  
you then your own matter, “ and nor  
“¢ afhamed to catch you: felfidle,”’as poor  
Dick fays. When there is fo much to be  
done for yourfeif, your family, your  
country, ond your gracious king, be  
up by peep of day; ‘* Let not the fun  
** look down and fay, inglorious here  
he lies.” Handle your tools without  
‘¢ mittens; remember that the cat in  
* gloves catches no mice,” as poor Ri-  
chard fays. °Tis true there is much to  
be done, and perhaps you are weak  
handed, but {tick to it fteadily, and  
you will fee great effects, for ‘ Con-  
{tant dropping wears away {tones,  
‘and by diligence and patience the  
“‘ moufe ate into the cable; and little  
“¢ ftrokes fell great oaks,” as poor Ri-  
“ chard fays in his almanac, the year I  
‘¢ cannot juft now remember. ©  
Methinks J hear fome of you fay,  
mult aman afford himfelfno leifure?”  
I will tell thee, my friend, what poor  
Richard fays, ** Employ thy time well  
“if thou meaneft to gain leifure; and  
‘¢ fince thou art not {ure of a minute,  
“¢ throw not away an hour.” Leifure,  
is time for doing fomething ufeful ; this  
leifure the diligent man will obtain,  
but the lazy man never; fo that, as  
poor Richard fays, “ A life of leifure  
* and a life of lazinefs are two things.”  
Do you imapine that floth will afford  
you more comfort than labour? No,  
jor as poor Richard fays, “ Trouble  
“* {prings from idlenefs, and grievous  
** toil from needlefs eafe. Many with-  
out labour, would live by their wits  
  
‘only, but they break for want of  
  
** ftock.” | Whereas indultry gives  
comfort, and plenty and refpect : Fly  
** pleafures, and they&#x27;ll follow you.  
“* The diligent {pinner hasa large hhift ;  
“and now I have a fheep and a cow,  
“ every body bids me good morrow ;”  
all which is well faid by poor Richard.  
But with our indultry, we mutt like-

‘« I never faw an oft removed tree,  
  
«¢ Nor yet an oft removed family.  
  
*¢ That throve fo weil as thoie that fettled be.””  
And again, “© Three removes is as bad  
as a fire;”’ and again, ** Keep thy fhop,  
“‘ and thy fhop will keep thee ;’”’ and  
again, * If you would have your bufi-  
“nefs done, go; if not, fend ;” and  
again,  
  
‘¢ He that by the plough would thrive,  
  
** Himilelf muft either hold or drive.”’  
  
And again, ** The eye of a matter will

and again, ‘* Want of care does us  
“ more damayve than want of know-  
“ledge; and again, Not to overfee  
“‘ workmen, is to leave them your  
** purfe open.” Trufting too much to  
others care is the ruin of many; for,  
as the almanac fays, * In the affairs of  
*‘ this world, men are faved, not by  
** faith, but by the want of it;” but a  
* man’s own care is profitable; for,  
faith poor Dick, ‘* Learning is to the  
“* {tudious, and riches to the careful,  
§* as well as power to the bold, and  
** heaven to the virtuous.” And far-  
ther, If you would have a faithful  
** fervant, and one that you like, ferve  
*€ yourfelf.”” And again, he advifeth  
to circumfpection and care, even in  
the fmalleft matters, becaufe fome-  
times, “ A little negleét may breed  
*¢ preat mifchief;-adding, For want of  
** a nail the thoe was loft ; for want of

“ want of a horfe the rider was loft;”  
being overtaken and flain by the enemy,  
— want of care about a horfe-fhoe  
nail,  
  
So much for induftry, my friends,  
and attention to one’s own bufinefs ;  
but to thefe we mult add frugality, if  
we would make our indultry more cer-  
tainly fuccefsful. A man may, if he  
knows not how to fave as he gets,  
keep his nofe all his life to the grind-  
ftone, and die not worth a groat at  
laft. $* A fat kitchen makes a lean will,”  
as poor Richard fays; and,  
  
  
  
N E  
  
** Many eftates are {pent in the getting,  
  
** Since women tor tea forfook {pinning and  
** Kenitting,  
  
** And men for punch forfook hewing and  
** {pi.tting.  
  
1758, 307  
  
““ If you would be wealthy,” fays he,  
in another almanac, “ think of faving  
“as well as getting: The /ndies have  
“not made Spain rich, becaufe her  
* outgoes arc greater than her in-  
“comes.” Away then with your ex-  
penfive follies, and you will not have  
fo much caufe to complain of hard  
times, heavy taxes, and chargeable fa-  
milies; tor, as peor Dick fays,  
  
** Women and wine, game and deceit,  
  
** Make the wealth fmall,.and the wants  
  
‘© great,””  
  
And farther, “* What maintains one  
*f vice, would bring uptwo children.”  
You may think perhaps, that a little  
tea, or a little punch now and then,  
diet a little more coltly, clothes a lit-  
tle finer, and a little entertainment  
now and then, can be no preat matter;  
but remember what poor Richard fays,  
‘6 Many a little makes a mickle ;”’ and  
farther, “ Beware of little expences ; a  
“¢ fmall leak will fink a great fhip; and  
again, “ Who dainties love, fhall beg-  
‘¢ gars prove ;” and moreover, * Fools  
‘* make feafts, and wife men eat them.”  
  
Here you areall got together at thig  
vendue of fineries and knicknacks, Yoy  
call them goods, but if you do not  
take care, they will proveevils to fome  
of you. You expect they will be fold  
cheap, and perhaps they may for lefs  
than they colt; but if you have no oce  
cafion for them, they muft be dear to  
yous Remember what poor Richard  
  
ays, ** Buy what thou haft no need of,  
y y  
  
‘* and ere long thou fhalt fell thy ne-  
“ ceffaries.” And again, “ At 2 great  
‘¢ penny-worth pauie a while: H¢  
means, that perhaps the cheapnefs is,  
rita only, and not real; of  
the bargain, by ftraitning thee in thy  
bufinefs, may do thee more harm than  
good. For in another place he fays,  
‘Many have been tuined by boying  
“€ good pennyworths.” * Again, pe

&lt;¢ money in a purchafe of repentance ;”  
and yet this folly is praétifed every  
day at vendues, tor want of minding  
the almanac. ‘“ Wife men, as poor  
“© Dick fays, learn by others harms,  
fools {carcely by their own; but,  
“‘ felix quem faciunt aliena pericula  
“¢ cautum.”’ Many a one tor the fake of  
finery on the back, have gone with a  
hungry belly, and half ftarved their fa-  
milies ; * Silks and fatins, {carlet and  
“‘ velvets,” as poor Richard fays, put  
« out the kitchen fire.”” Thefe are not  
the neceMfaries of life; they can {carce-  
ly be called the conveniencies, and yet  
only becaufe they look pretty, how  
many want tohave them? The artfi-  
cial wants of mankind thus become  
more numerous than the natural; and  
as poor ‘ick fays, ** For one poor per-  
‘¢ fon, there are an hundred indigent.”  
By theie, and other extravagancies, the  
peateci are reduced to poverty, and  
forced to borrow of thofe whom they  
formerly defpifed, but who through in-  
dultry and frugality have maintained  
their (tanding 31 nwhic! cafe it appears  
plainly, that “* A ploughman on his  
“legs is higher than a gentleman on  
“his kaees,” as poor Richard fays.  
Perhaps they have had a fimall eltate  
left them which they knew not the  
etting of; they think, “ ’tis day, and  
© will never be night ;” thata little to  
be {pent out of fo much, is not, worth  
minding; ‘ (a child and a fool,” as  
sor Richard fays, “ imagine twenty  
“¢ fhillings and twenty years can never  
“ be fpent) but, always taking out of  
“ the meal tub, and never putting in,  
« foon comes to the bottom; then, as  
“ poor Dick fays, when the well is dry,  
«¢they know the worth of water.”  
But this they might have known before,  
if they had taken his advice: “ If you  
** would know the value of money, go  
« and try to borrow fome ; far, he that  
‘€ goes a borrowing goes a forrow-  
“ing,” and indeed fo does he that  
lends to fuch people, when he goes to  
get it again.~-Poor Dick farther advi-  
fi, my: ;  
  
*¢ Fond pride and drefs, is fure a ver  
** E’er fancy you confule, eonfult your  
  
Y Curfe ;  
purfe,””  
  
And again, “ Prideis as loud a begpar  
“¢ as want, and a greatdeal more faucy,”  
When 50a have bought one fine thin  
you mutt buy ten more, that your ap-  
pearance may be all of a piece: bu  
poor Dick fays, “Tis eafier to fupprefs  
‘the firlt defire, than to fatisfy all  
* that follows it.” And ‘tis as truly  
folly for the poor to ape the rich, 4s  
the frog to fwell, in order to equal  
the ox,  
  
‘*’Great eflates may venture more,  
  
‘* Bur little boats fhould keep near thore.””  
“Tis however a folly foon punithed;  
‘¢ for pride that dines on vanity fups  
“on contempt,” as poor Richard fays,  
And in another place, “ Pride break-  
“¢ fafted with plenty, dined with pover-  
‘¢ ty, and fupped with infamy.” And  
after all, of what ufe is this pride of ap-  
pearance, for which fo much is nifked,  
  
fo much is fuffered? It cannot pros .  
  
mote health, or eafe pain; it makes no  
increafe of merit in the perfon, it cre  
ates envy, it haftens misfortune.  
  
*¢ What is a butt-rfly? At heft  
¢* He’s bit a caterp ‘ler dreft.  
 -6© The gaudy fop’s his piéture juft,””  
  
as poor Richard fays.  
  
But what madnefs mult it be to run -  
  
in debt for thefe fuperfluities! We are  
offered, by the terms of this vendue,  
fix months credit; and that perhaps  
has induced fome of us to attend it,  
becaufe we cannot {pare the ready mo-  
ney, and hope now to be fine without  
it. But ah, think what you do when  
you run in debt; you give to another  
power over your liberty. If you can-  
not pay at the time you will be alha-  
med to fee your creditor; you will be  
in fear when you fpeak to him; you  
will make poor pitiful fneaking excules,  
and by degrees come to lofe your ve-  
er: and iat into the bafe down-  
right lying; for as poor Richard [ays,  
- The fecond vice ie lying, the firlt is  
*f running in debt,” Act again, to  
  
the fame purpofe, “ lying rides upo  
Pe ee, poe ee debt’  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
fups  
fays,  
  
« debt’s back.’? Whereas a freeborn  
kzglifoman ought not to be afhamed  
or afraid to fee or fpeak to any man  
living. But poverty often deprives a  
man of all fpirit and virtue: ‘* Tis  
‘‘ hard for an empty bag to ftand up-  
right,” as poor Richar! truly fays.  
What would you think of that prince,  
or that government, who would iffue  
an edi&amp;t forbidding you to drels like a  
gentleman or a ventlewoman, on pain  
of imprifonment or fervitude? Would  
you not fay, that you are free, have a  
right to drefs as you pleafe, and that  
fuch an ediét would be a breach of  
your privileges, and fuch a govern-  
ment tyrannical? And yet you are a-  
bout to put yourfelf under that tyran-  
nh, when you run in debt for fuch drefs!  
Your c:editor has authority at his plea-  
fure to deprive you of your liberty, by  
confining you in gaol for life, or by  
{elling you for a fervant, if you fhould  
not be able to pay him, When you  
have got your bargain, you may, per-  
haps, think little of payment; but * Cre-  
ditors,” as poor Dick tells us, “wave  
better memories than debtors ;” and in  
another place fays, ‘* Creditors are a  
* fuperftitious fe&amp;, great obfervers of  
“‘ fet days and times.” The day comes  
round before you are aware, and the  
demand is made before you are prepa-  
red to fatisfy it. Or if you bear your  
debt in mind, the term which at firft  
feemed fo long, will, as it leflens, ap-  
pearextremely fhort. Time will feem  
to haye added wings to his heels as  
well as fhoulders. ‘* Thofe have a  
“ fhort Lent, faith poor Richard, who  
*‘ owe money to be paid at Eaffer.”  
Then fince as he fays ** The borrow-  
*¢ er is a flave to the lender, and the  
$* debtor to the creditor,” difdain the  
  
chain, preferve ‘your freedom ; and  
  
maintain your independency: be in-  
duftrious and free ; be frogal and free.  
At prefent, perhaps you may think  
yourfelf in thriving cirgumftances, and  
that you can bear a little extrayagance  
without injury ; but, -  
  
&quot; _ €€-For age end want, fave while you may j

as poor Richard fays.—Gain may be  
  
temporary and uncertain, but ever  
while you live, expence is conftant  
and certain ; and ** ’tis eafier to build  
“two chimneys than to keep one in  
“ tuel, as poor Richard fays. So ra-  
‘ther to go to bed fupperlefs than  
‘¢ rife in debt.  
  
**« Get what you can, and what you g-t hold.  
** *Tis the ftone that will turn ali your lead  
into gold.””  
As poor Richard fays. And when you  
have got the philofopher’s ftone, fure  
you will no longer complain of bad  
times, or the difiiculty of paying  
taxes,  
  
This doétrine, my friends, is rea-  
fon and wifdom ; but after all, do not  
depend too much upon your own in-  
duftry, and frugality, and prudence,  
though excellent things, for they may  
all be blafted without the blefliag of  
heaven; and therefore afk that blefling  
humbly, and be not uncharitable to  
thofe that at prefent feem to want it,  
bur comfort and help them. Remem-  
ber Fob fuffered, and was afterwards  
profperous.  
  
_ And now toconclude, “ Experience  
“keeps a dear {chool, but fools will  
“¢ fearn in no other, and {carce in that;  
‘¢ for it is true, we may give advice  
“* but we cannot give conduét,” as poor  
Richard fays : however remember this,  
“© They that won’t be counfelled, can’t  
“be helped,” as poor Richard fays:  
and farther, ** That if you will not  
“hear reafon, fhe’ll furely rap your  
«* knuckles.” |  
  
~ Thus the old gentleman ended his  
harangac. The people heard it, and  
‘approved the doctrine, and immedi-  
ately practifed the contrary, juft as if  
it had been a common fermon; for  
the vendue opened, and they began ta  
buy extravagantly, notwithftanding all  
his cautions, and their own fear of  
taxes.—I found the good man had  
thoroughly ftudied my almanacs, and  
digeltcd all I had dropt. on thofe to-  
picks during the courfe of five and  
twenty years. The frequent mention

one elfe, but my vanity was wonder-  
fully delighted with it, though I was  
confcious that not a tenth part of the  
wifdom was my own which he afcri-  
bed to me, but rather the pleanings I  
had made of the fenfe of all ages and  
nations. However I refolved to be  
the better for the echo of it; and  
though I had at firlt determined to buy  
fiuft for a new coat, I went away re-  
folved to wear my old one a little long-  
er. Reader, if thou wilt do the

For I never faw an oft removed tree,  
Nor, yet an oft remayed family, }  
  
That throve io well as thofe that fettled be.  
  
Three removes is as bad as a fire—  
keep thy fhop, and thy fhop will  
keep thee.  
  
If you would have your bufinefé  
done, go—if not fend.  
  
He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himfelf muift either hold or drive.  
  
The diligent eye of the mafter wilf  
do more wark than both his hands.  
  
Want of care does us more damage  
than want of knowledge.  
  
Not to overfee workmen is to leave  
them your purfe open. |  
  
In affairs of this world men are  
faved not by faith, but by the want  
of it.  
  
Learning is for the ftudious, riches  
for the careful, power for the bold,  
and heaven for the virtuous.  
  
A little neglect may breed great  
mifchief; for a want of a nail the  
fhoe was loit; for want of a fhoe the  
horfe was lott; and for want of a  
horfe the rider was loit, being over-  
taken and flain by the enemy; all  
for want of care about a horfe-fhoe-  
nail.  
  
A man may, if he knows not how  
to fave as he gets, keep his nofe all  
his life to the grinditone, and die not  
worth a groat at laft.  
  
A fat kitchen will always make a  
lean will; for many citates are {pent  
in the getting,  
  
Since women for tea forfook fpinning and  
  
knitting,  
  
And men for punch forfook hewing and  
  
fplitting.

others. Judge then how much I muft  
have been gratified by an incident I am  
going to relate to you. I ftopped my  
horfe lately where a great number of  
people were colleéted at an auétion of  
  
Merchants goods. The hour ofthe ”  
  
fale not being come, they were converf-  
  
ing or the badnefs of the times, and  
one of the company called to a plain  
clean old man, with white locks, ‘* Pray,  
  
Father Abraham, what think you of the  
  
times? Will not thefe heavy taxes quite  
  
ruin the country? How fhall we be ever  
  
able to pay them? What would you  
  
advife us to ?**—Father Abraham food  
up, and replied, ** If you would have  
my advice, I will give it you in thort,  
for a word to the wife is enough.”  
They joined in defiring him to {peak his  
mind, and gathering round him, he  
proceeded as follows:  
  
FRIENDS, fays he, the taxes are,  
indeed, very heavy, and, if thofe laid  
on by the Government were the only  
ones we had to pay, we might more ea-  
fily difcharge them; but we have many  
others, and much more grievous to fome  
of us. Weare taxed twice as much  
by our idlenefs, three times as much by  
our pride, and four times as much by  
our folly: And from thefe taxes the  
Commiffioners cannot eafe or deliver us  
by allowing an abatement.- sags  
  
et  
  
  
  
  
  
60  
  
let us hearken to good advice, and fome-  
thing may be done for us; ** God heips  
them that help themfelves,” as poor  
Richard fays.  
  
It would be thought a hard Govern-  
ment that fhould tax its people one  
tenth part of their time, to be employed  
in its fervice. But idienefs taxes many  
of us much more; floth, by~ bringing  
on difeafes, abfolutely fhortens life.  
*¢ Sloth, like ruft, confumes fafter than  
labour wears, while the ufed key is al-  
ways bright. But doft thou love life,  
then do not fquander time, fer that is  
the ftuff life is made of. — How much  
more.than is neceffary do we fpend in  
fleep! forgetting that the fleeping  
tex catches no poultry, and that there  
will be fleeping enough in the grave.  
If time be of all things the moft pre-  
cious, wafting time mult be, as poor  
Richard fays, the greateft prodigality ;”  
fince, as he elfewhere tells, ‘* Loft. time  
is never found again ; and what we call  
time enough, always proves little e-  
nough: Let us then up and be doing,  
and doing to the purpofe; fo by dili-  
gence fhall we do more with lefs sper-  
plexity. Sloth makes all things dif-  
ficult, but induftry ail eafy, and, He  
that rifeth late, muft trot all day, and  
fhall fcarce overtake his bufinefs at  
  
night: While lazinefs travels fo flowly,  
that poverty foon overtakes him. Drive  
thy bufineis, Jet not that drive thee ;  
and early to bed, and early to rife,  
makes a man healty, wealthy, and  
wile.”  
  
So what fignifies wifhing and hcping  
  
for better times? We may make thele  
times better if we beftir ourfelv:s. ** In-  
duftry need not with ; and he that lives  
upon hope will die fafting. Thcre are  
no gains without pains; then help  
hands, for I have no lands,” or if I  
have, they are fmartly taxed. “* He  
that hath a trade hath‘an eftate ; and  
he that hath acalling hath an office of  
profit and honour ;”” but then the trade  
mutt be worked at, and the calling well  
followed, or neither the eftate, nor the  
office, will enable us to pay our taxes.  
—If we are induftrious we fhall never  
ftarve; for, at the working man’s houfe  
hunger looks in, but dares not enter.”  
Nor will the Bailiff or the Conftable  
‘ enter, for ‘* Induftry pays debts, while  
defpair increafeth them.” What though  
you have found no treafure, nor has  
any-rich relation left you a legacy,  
** Diligence is the mother of good-juck,  
aud God gives all things to induftry.  
  
Curious Addrefs in an Audtion-Room.  
  
Then plow deep, while fluggards fleeps  
and you fha!l have corn to fell and to  
kcep.” Work while it is called to-day,  
for you know not how much you may  
be hindered to-moirow, ** One to-day  
is worth two to morrows;&quot;and fariher,  
‘© never leave that till to-magrow which  
you can do to-day.” If. you were a  
fervant, wou!d you not be afhamed that  
a good mafter fhould catch yeu idle?  
Are you then your owr matter, ** Be  
afhamed to catch yourfelf idle,” when  
there is fo much to be done for yourfelf,  
your family, your country, and your  
King. Handle your tools without mit-  
tens ; remember, ‘¢ That the cat in  
gloves catches no mice.” It is true,  
there is much to be done, and, per-  
haps,- you are weak-handed, but flick  
to it fteadily, and you will fee great  
effedts, for ** Conftant dropping wears  
away fiones, and by diligence and pa-  
tience the moufe ate in two the cable ;  
and little ftrokes fell great oaks.”  
  
Methinks I hear fome of you fay,  
«« Muft a man afford himfelf no lei-  
fure ? —I will tell thee, my friend,  
what poor Richard fays, ‘¢ Employ thy  
time well if thou meaneft to gain leifure 5  
and, fince thou art not fure of a minute,  
throw not away an hour.” Leifure is  
time for doing fomething ufeful ; this  
leifure the diligent man will obtain,  
but the lazy man never; for “ A life  
of leifure and a life of lazinefs are two  
things. Many without labour would  
live by-their wits only, but they break  
for want of ftock.”” Whereas induftry  
gives comfort, and plenty, and refpect.  
“* Fly pleafures and they will follow  
you. The diligent Spinner has a large  
fhift; and now I have a fheep and a  
cow, every body bids me good-mor-  
row,”  
  
But with our induftry we muft like-  
wife he fteady, fettled, and careful, and  
overfee our own affairs with our own  
eyes, and not truft too much to others ;  
  
or  
  
«IT never faw an oft rentoved tree,  
  
© Nor yet an oft removed family,  
  
‘ That throve fo well as thofe that  
  
© fertled be.”  
  
And again, ‘* Three removes is as  
bad as a fire ;” and again, ‘“* Keep thy  
fhop, and thy thop will keep thee ;”  
and-agaim, ‘* If you would have your  
bufinefs done, go ; if not, fend.” And  
again, ’  
  
‘ He that by the plough would thrive,  
  
‘ Himfelf muft either hold or drive,”  
  
And again, ** The eye of a mafter gk  
e  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
do more work than both his hands ;”  
and again, ‘* Want of care does us  
more damage than want of knowledge :”  
and again, * Not t&gt; overfeg Workmen  
is to leave them your purfe open.”  
Trufting too much to others care is the  
ruin of many; for, ** In the affairs of  
this world, men are faved, not by faith,  
but by the want of it;”’ but&#x27;a man’s  
own caie is p ofitable; for, ‘* If you  
would have a faithful fervant, and one  
that you like, ferve yourfeif. A little  
negleé&amp;t may breed great mifchief;_ for  
want of anail the thoe was lof; for  
want of a fhoe the horfe was loft ; and  
for want of a horfe the rider Was loft ;”  
being overtaken and flain by the enemy ;  
all for want of care about a horfe. thoe  
nail,  
  
So much for induftry, my friends,  
and attention to one’s own’ bufinefs ;  
but to thefe we muft add frugality, if  
we would make our induftry more cer-  
tainly fuccefsful. A man may, if he  
knows not how ‘to fave as he gets,  
** Keep his nofe all his life to the grind-  
ftone, and die not worth a groat at laft.  
A fat kitchen makes a Jean will, and,  
  
‘ Many eftates are fpent in the getting,  
* Since women for tea forfook {pinning  
‘ and knitting,  
¢ And men for punch forfook hewing  
‘ and fplitting,”  
‘¢1f you would be wealthy, think of  
faving, as well as of getting: The In-  
dies have not made Spain rich, becaufe,  
her out-goes aie greater than her in-  
comes.”  
  
Away, then, with your expenfive  
follies, and you will not then have fo  
much caufe to complain of hard times,  
heavy taxes, and chargeable families ;  
for,  
  
* Women and wine, game and deceit,  
‘Make the wealth imail, and the  
* want great.”  
And farther, ‘© What maintains one  
vice, would bring up two children.”  
You may think, perhaps, that a little  
tea, or a little punch now and then,  
diet a little more coftly, cloaths a little  
finer, and a little entertainment now  
and then, can be no great matter; but  
remember, ‘* Many a little makes a  
  
mickle; beware of little expences; a  
  
fmall leak will fink a great fhip ;” and  
again, ** Who dainties love fhall beg-  
gars prove ;” and moreover, ‘* Fools  
make feafts, and wife men eat them.”  
Here you are all got together at this  
fale of fineries and nick-nacks. You  
  
call them goods, but if you do not take  
care, they will prove evils to fome of

you. You expect they will be fold  
cheap, and, perhaps, they\may for: lef  
than they coft; but if you have no ecs  
calion for them, they mult be dear to  
  
cu. Remember what poor Richard  
jays, ‘* Buy what thou heft no need of,  
and ere long thou fhalt feil thy necefla-  
ries.’ And again, “ Ata great pen-  
nyworth paufe awhile.” He means,  
that perhaps the cheapnefs is apparent  
only, and not real; or the bargain, by  
ft:aitening thee in thy bufinefs, may do  
thee more harm than good. For in an-  
other place he fays, ** Many have been  
ruined by buying good pennyworths.”*  
Again, ‘ It is toolith to lay out money  
in a purchafe of repentance ;” and yet  
this folly is praétifed every day at auc-  
tions, for want of minding the Alma-  
nack.. Many a one, for the fake of  
finery on the back, have gone with a  
hungry belly, and half ftarved their fa-  
milies ; ** Silks and fattins, fcarlet and  
velvets, put out the kitchin fire.” Thefe  
are not the neceffaries of life; they can  
fcarcely be called the conveniencies, and  
yet, only becaufe they look pretty, how  
many want to have them? By thefe,  
and other extravagancies, the genteel  
are reduced to poverty, and forced to  
borrow of thofe whom they formerly  
defpifed, but who, through induftry  
and frugality, have maintained their  
ftanding ; in which cafe it appears plain=  
ly, that ** A Ploughman on his legs is  
higher than a Gentieman on his knees.”  
Perhaps they have had a fmall eftate left  
them, which they knew not the getting  
of ; they think ‘It is day, and will  
never be night ;” that a little to be fpent  
out of fo much is not worth minding ;  
but always taking out of the meal.tub,  
and never putting in, foon comes to the  
bottom ; and then, ‘* When the well is  
dry, they know the worth of the water.”  
But this they might have known before,  
if they had taken his advice: ‘ If you  
would know the value of money, go  
and try to borrow fome ; for he that  
goes a borrowing gocs a forrowing ;&quot;*  
and, indeed, fo does he that lends to  
fuch people, when he goes to get itin a-  
gain.—Poor Dick farther advifes, and  
fays, ;  
  
‘ Fond pride of drefs is fure avery curfe ;  
  
‘ Ere fancy you con{ult, confult your  
  
¢ purfe.”  
  
And again, ‘ Pride is as louda beggar  
as Want, anda great deal more faucy.””  
When you have bought ove fine thing,  
you mutt buy ten move, that your ap-  
pearance may be all of a piece; but  
poor Dick fays, * It is eafier to ‘upprefs  
- the  
  
  
  
  
.  
  
62  
the firft defire, than to fatisfy all that  
follow it.” And it is as truly folly for  
the poor to ap&lt; the rich, as the frog to  
fwell, in order to equal the ox.  
  
€ Veflels large may venture more,  
  
* But little Loats fhould keep near  
  
‘ fhore.’  
  
It is, however, a folly foon punithed ;  
for ‘* Pride that dines on vanity, fups  
on contempt; Pride breakfafted with  
plenty, dined with poverty, and fupped  
with infamy.” And, after all, of what  
ufe is this pride of appearance for which  
  
fo much isrifqued, fo much is fuffered &gt;  
  
It cannot promote health, nor eafe pain ;  
it makes no increafe of merit in the per-  
fon, it creates envy, it haftens misfor-  
tune.  
  
But what madnefs muft it be to run  
in debt for thefe fuperfluities! We ae  
offered, by the terms of this fale, fix  
months credit; and that, perhaps, has  
induced fome of us to attend it, becaule  
we cannot {pare the ready money, and  
hope now to be fine without it. But  
ah! think what you do when you run  
in debt; you give to another power over  
your liberty. If yon cannot pay at the  
  
time, you will be afhamed to {ee your  
creditor ; you wil] be in fear when you  
{peak to him; you will make poor piti-  
  
fal fneaking excufes, and, by degrees,  
come to lole your veracity, and fink  
into bafe downright lying, for, ** The  
fecond vice is lying, the firft is.running  
in debt.”” And again, to the fame pur-  
pofe, “ Lying rides upon Debt’s back.”  
Whereas a free-born Englifhman ought  
not to be afhamed nor afraid to fee or  
fpeak to any man living. But poverty  
often deprives a man of all fpirit and  
virtue. ‘* It is hard for an empty bag  
to ftand upright.” What would you  
think of that Prince, or of that Govern-  
ment, who fhould iffue an edié forbid-  
ding you to drefs like a Gentleman or  
a Gentlewoman, on pain of imprifon-  
ment or fervitude? Would you not fay  
that you were free, have a right tg drefs  
as you pleafe, and that fuch an edié&amp;  
would be a breach of your privileges,  
and fuch a Government tyrannical ?  
And yet you are about to put yourfelf  
under that tyranny, when you run in  
debt for fuch drefs! Your creditor has  
authority, at his pleafure, to deprive you  
of your liberty, by ccnfining you in  
goal for life, or by feliing you for a  
fervant, if you fhould not be able to pay  
him. When you have got your bar-  
gain, you may, perhaps, think little  
of payment ; but ‘ Creditors have bet-  
  
Curious Addrefs in an Auétion-Room.  
  
ter memories than Debtors; Creditor$  
are a fuperftitious fect, great obfervers  
of fet days and times.” The day comes  
round before you are aware, and the de-  
mand is made before you are prepared  
to fatisfy it; or if you bear your debt  
in min}, the term, which at firft feem-  
ed fo long, will, as it leffens, appear  
extreme&#x27;y fhort: Time will feem to  
have added wings to his héels as well as  
his fhoulders. ‘* ‘Thofe have a thort  
Lent, who owe money to be paid at  
Eafter.” At prefesit, perhaps, you may  
think yourfeives in thriving circum-  
ftances, and that you can bear a little  
extravagance without injury ; but,  
  
‘ For age and want fave while you  
  
* may ;  
  
* No morning fun lafts a whole day.”  
Gain may be temporary and uncertain,  
but ever, while you a expence is  
conftant and certain ; and * It is eafer  
to build two chimneys than to keep one  
in fuel.” So ‘ rather go to bed fupper-  
lefs than rife in debt :  
  
* Get what you can, and what you  
  
* get hold,  
* It is the ftone that will turn all your  
* lead into gold.’  
And when you have-got the Philofo-  
pher’s ftone, fure you will no longer  
complain of bad times, or the difficulty  
of paying taxes.  
  
This doétrine, mty friends, is reafon  
and wifdom: But, after all, do not de-  
pend too much upon your own induftry,  
and frugality, and prudence, though  
excellent things, for they may all be  
blafted, without the bleffing of Heaven ;  
and therefore afk that blefling humbly,  
and be not uncharitable to thofe that at  
prefent feem to want it, but comfort  
and help them. Remember, Job fuf-  
fered, and was afterwards profperous.  
  
And now to conclude, ** Experience  
keeps a dear fchool, but feols will learn  
in no other, and f{carce in that; for, it  
is true, we may give, advice, but -we  
cannot give conduét:&quot;’ However, re-  
member this, ‘* They that will not be  
counfelled, cannot be ‘helped; and  
farther, ‘¢ That if you will not hear rea-  
fon, fhe will furely tap your kunckles.”  
  
Thus the old, Gentleman ended his  
harangue. The people heard it, and  
approved the doctrine, and immediate-  
ly pra&amp;tifed the contrary, juft as if it  
had been a common fermon; for the  
Audtion opened, and they began &#x27;e buy  
extravagantly.—I found the gcod man  
had thoroughly ftudied my Almanacks,  
and digefted all I had dropped on thofe  
  
topics  
  
  
  
Mr. Voltaire’s. Anfwer to Mr. Maribaud.  
  
topics during the courfe of twerty-five  
years. The frequent mention he made  
of me mutt have tired any one elfe, ‘but  
my vanity was wonderfully delighted  
with it, though I was confcious that  
not atenth part of the wifdom was my  
own which he afcribed to me, but ra-  
ther the gleanings that I had made of  
the fenfe of all ages and nations: How-  
ever, I refolved to be the better for the  
echo of it, and, though I had firft de-  
termined to buy ftuff for a new coat, I  
went away refolved to wear my old one  
alittic longer. Reader, if thou wilt do  
the fame, thy profit wiil be as great as  
mine. I am, as ever, thine to ferve

works refpceétfully quoted by others. Judge  
then how much I muft have been gratified  
by an incident I am going to relate to you.  
Th my horfe lately where a great num-  
ber of people were coll: ted at an auction of  
Merchants goods. The hour of fale not  
being come, they were coaverfing on the  
badnefs of the times, and one of the com-  
pany called to a pluin clean old man, with  
white locks, ‘ Pray, father Abraham, what  
think you of the times? Will not thefe hea-  
vy taxes quite ruin the country ? How fhall  
we be ever able to pay them ? What would  
you advife us to ?’—Father Abraham ftood  
up, and replied, * If you would have my  
advice, I will give it you in fhort, fora  
word to the wile is enough.” They joined  
im defiring him to {peak his mind, and, ga-  
thering round him, he preceeded as fol-  
lows :  
  
Friends, fays he, the taxes are, indeed,  
-very heavy, and, if thofe laid on by the  
Government were the only ones we had to  
pay, we might more eafily difcharge them ;  
  
ut we have many others, and much more  
grievous to fome of us. We are taxed  
,twice as much by our idlenefs, three times as  
much by our pride, and four times as much  
by our folly; And from thefe taxes the  
Commiffioners cannot eafe or deliver us by  
allowing an abatement. However let us  
hearken to good advice, and fomething may  
be done for us; * God helps them that  
help themfelves,’ as poor Richard fays.  
  
It would be thought a hard Government  
that fhould tax its people one tenth part of  
their time, to be employed in its fervice.  
But idlenefs taxes many of us much more ;  
floth, by bringing on difeafes, ab{clutely  
thortens life. ¢ Sloth, like ruft, confumes  
falter than labour wears, while the ufed key  
is always bright. But doft thou love life,  
then do not {quander time, for that is the  
  
ftuff life is made of. — How much more than  
is neceflary do.we fpend in fleep! forgetting  
that the fleeping fox cxtches no poultry, and  
that there will be fleeping enouyh in the  
grave. If time be of all things the moit  
precious, wafting time mutt be, as poor  
Richard fays, the gyeateft _prodigaliry ;°  
fince, as he elfewhere tells, * Loft time ts  
never found again ; and what we call time  
enough always proves little enough: Let  
us then up and be doing, and doing to the  
purpofe ; fo by diligence {hall we do more  
with Icefs perplexity. Sloth makes ail things  
difficult, but induftry all ealy, and he,  
that rifeth late, mutt trot all day, and  
fhall {carce overtake his bufinefs at night :  
While lazinefs travels fo flowly, that poverty  
foon overtakes him. Drive thy bufinefs, Jet  
not that drive thee ; and early to bed, and  
early to rife, makes a man healthy, wealthy,  
and wife.’  
  
So what fignifies withing and hoping for  
better times ?. We may make thefe times bet-  
ter, if we beflir ourfelves. ¢ indyftry needs  
not with ; and he that lives upon hope will  
die fatting. There are no gains without  
pains ; then help hands, for I have no lands,’  
or, if I have, they .are fmartly taxed. He  
that hath a trade hath an eftate ; and he that  
hath a calling hath an office of profit and  
honour ;” but then the trade muft be worked  
at, and the calling well foliowed, or neither  
the eftate, nor the office, wil] enable us to  
pay our taxes.—If we are induftrious, we  
fhall never ftarve ; for, ‘at the working  
man’s houfe, hunger looks in, but dares not  
enter.” Nor will the Bailiff or the Conftable  
enter, for * Induftry pays debts, while de-  
fpair increafeth them.” What though you  
have found no treafure, nor has any rich  
relation left you a legacy, ¢ Diligence is the  
mother of good luck, and God gives all  
things to induftry. Then plough deep,  
while fluggards fieep, and you will have  
corn.to 1¢i and to keep.” Work while it. i

FOR APRIL, 1771. 199  
  
called to-day, for you know not how much  
you may be hindered to-morrow, ‘ One  
to-day is worth two to morrows ;” and far-  
ther, ‘ Never leave that til] to-morrow which  
you can can do to-day.” If you were a  
fervant, would you not be afhamed that a  
good matter fhould catch you idle ? Are you  
then your own mafter, ‘ Be afhamed to  
catch yourlelf idle,” when there is fo much  
to be done for yourfelf, your family, your  
country, and your King. Handle your  
tools without mittens; remember, ¢ ‘That  
the cat in gloves catchcs no mice.” It is  
true, there is much to be done, and, per-  
haps, you are weak-handed, but ftick to it  
fteadily, and you will fee great effeéts, for  
* Conttant dropping wears away ftones, and  
by diligence and patience the moufe ate in  
two the cable; and little ftrckes fell great  
oaks.”  
  
Methinks I hear fome of you fay, ¢ Mutt  
a man afford himéelf no leifure ??&gt;—I will  
tell thee, my friend, what poor Richard  
fays, ‘ Employ thy time well if thou meaneft  
to gain leifure ; and, fince thou art not fure  
of a minute, throw not away an hour.’  
Leifure is time for doing fomething ufeful ;  
this leifure the diligent man will obtain, but  
the lazy man never; for ¢ A life of leifure  
and a life of lazineis are two things. Many  
without labour would live by their wits on-  
ly, but they break for want of ftock.°  
Whereas induftry gives comfort, and plen-  
ty, and refpeé&amp;t. Fly pleafures and they  
will follow you. The diligent fpinner has  
a large thift; and now I have a fheep and  
a cow, every body bids me gvod-mor-  
tow.’  
  
But with our induftry we muft likewife  
be fteady, fettled, and careful, and overfee  
our own affairs with our own eyes, and not  
truft too much to others, for  
  
© I never faw an oft removed tree,  
  
Nor yetan oft removed family,  
  
7 me throve fo well as thofe that fettled  
  
be.” ;  
  
And again, ¢ Three removes is as bad as  
a fire; and again, ‘Keep thy fhop, and  
thy thop will keep thee ;* and again, * If  
you would have your bufineis done, go ; if  
not, fend.” And again,  
  
‘ He that by the plough would thrive,  
  
Himéfelf muft either hold or drive.’  
  
And again, ¢ The eye of a mafter will do  
more work than both his hands ;” and again,  
‘Want of care does us more damage than  
want of knowledge :” and again, * Net to  
overfee workmen is to leave them your  
purfe open.” ‘Trufting too much to oihers  
eare is the ruin of many ; for, * In the af-  
fas of this world, men are faved, not by  
  
faith, but by the want of it ;* but a man’s  
own care is profitable ; for, * If you would  
have a faithful fervant, and one that you  
like, ferve yourfelf. A little negle&amp;t may  
breed great mifchief ; for want of a nail the  
fhoe was loft ; and for want of a fhoe the  
horfe was loft ; and for want of a horfe the  
rider was loft ;* being overtaken and flaia  
by the enemy ; all for want of care about a  
horfe-fhoe nail.  
  
So much for induftry, my friends, and  
attention to one’s own bufinefs ; but to thefe  
we mutt add frugality, if we would make  
our induftry more certainly fuccefsful. A  
man may, if he knows not how to fave as be  
gets, ‘ Keep his nofe all his life to the grind-  
ftone, and die not worth a great at laft. A  
fat kitchen makes a lean will,’ and  
  
* Many eftates are {pent in the getting,  
  
Since women for tea forfook {pinning and  
  
knitting,  
  
And men for-punch forfook hewing and  
  
fplitting.”  
  
© 1f you would be wealthy, think of fav-  
ing, as well as of getting: The Indies  
have not made Spain rich, becaufe her out-  
goes are greater than her incomes.”  
  
Away then, with your expenfive follies,  
and you will not then have fo much caufe  
to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and  
chargeable families ; for  
  
* Women and wine, game and deccit,  
  
Make the wealth jimall, and the want  
  
reat.”  
  
And farther, © What maintains one vice  
would bring up two children.” You may  
think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little  
punch now and then, diet a little more coft-  
ly, cloaths a little finer, and a little enter-  
tainment now and then, can be no great  
matter; but remember, ¢ Many a litle  
makes a mickle ; beware of little expences 5  
a fall leak will fink a great fhip ;° and a-  
gain, * Who dainties love fhali beggars  
prove ;° and moreover, ‘ Fools make feafts,  
and wife men eat them.”  
  
Here you are all got together at this file  
of fineries and nick-nacks. You call them  
goods, but, if you do not take care, they  
will prove evils to fome of you. You expect  
they will be fold cheap, and, perhaps, they  
may for lefs than they coft ; but, if you have  
no occafion for them, they muft be dear te  
you. Remember what poor Richard fays,  
* Buy what thou haft no need of, and ere  
long thou fhalt fell thy neceflaries.” And a-  
gain, ¢ At a great pennyworth paule a  
while.” He means, that perhaps the cheap-  
nefs is apparent only, and not real; or the  
bargain, by ftraitening thee in thy bufinels,  
may do thee more harm than good. For ia

another place he fays, * Many have been  
ruined by buying geod pennyworths.” A-  
gain, * Itis fuolith to Jay out money ina  
purchafe of repentance ;” and yet this folly  
1s practifed every day at auctions, for want  
of minding the Almanack. Many aone,  
for the fake of finery on the back, have  
gone with a hungry belly, and half ftarved  
their families; Silks and fattins, {carlet and  
velvets, put out the kitchen-fire.” Thefe  
are not the neceffaries of life; they can  
fcarcely be called the conveniencies, and yet,  
only becaufe they look pretty, how many  
want tohave them! By thefe, and other ex-  
travagancies, the genteel are reduced to po-  
verty, and forced to borrow of thofe whom  
they formerly defpifed, but who, through in-  
dufiry and frugality, have maintained their  
ftanding ; in which cafe it appears plainly,  
that ¢ A ploughmon on his Jegs is higher  
than a Gentleman on his knees.” Perhaps  
they have had a {mall eftate left them, which  
they knew not the getting of; they think  
© It is day, and will never be night ;” that  
a little to be {pent out of fo much is not  
worth minding ; but always taking out of  
the meal-tub, and never putting in, {con  
comes to the bottom; and then, ¢ When  
the well is dry, they know the. worth of the  
water.” But this they might have known be-  
fore, if they had taken his advice: ‘ If you  
would know the value of money, go and  
try to borrow fome ; for he that goes a bor-  
rowing goes 2 forrowing,’ and, indeed, {fo  
does he that lends to fuch people, when he  
goes to get itin again..—Poor Dick farther  
advifes, and fays,  
  
* Fond pride of drefs is fure a very curfe ;  
  
Ere fancy you confult, confult your purfe.’  
And again, ‘ Pride is as loud a beggar as  
want, and a great deal more faucy.”, When  
you have bought one fine thing, you mutt  
buy ten more, that your appearance may be  
all of a piece ; but poor Dick fays, ¢ It is  
eafier to fupprefs the firft defire, than to fa-  
tisfy all that follow it.” And it is as truly  
folly for the poer to ape the rich, as the  
Mog to fell, in order to equal the ox.  
  
* Veflels large may venture more,  
  
But little bcats fhould keep near fhore.”  
It is, however, a folly foon punithed ; for  
* Pride th:t dives on vanity fups on con-

But what madnefs muft it be to run in  
  
THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
debt for thefe fuperfluities ! We are offered,  
by the terms of this fale, fix months credit ;  
and that, perhaps, has induced fome of us  
to attend it; becaufe we cannot {pare the  
ready money, and hope now to be fine with-  
outit. Butah! think what you do when  
you run in debt ; you give to another power  
over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the  
time, you will be afhamed to fee your cre-  
ditor ; you will be in fear when you fpeak  
to him ; you will make poor pitiful fneak-  
ing excufes, and, by degrees, come to lofe  
your veracity, and fink into bafe downright  
lying, for ¢ The fecond vice is lying, the  
firft 1s running in debt.” And agai, to the  
fame purpofe, * Lying rides upon Debt’s  
back.” Whereas a free-born Englifhman  
ought not to be afhamed nor afraid to fee or  
fpeak to any man living. But poverty of-  
ten deprives a man of all fpirit and virtue.  
* It is hard for an empty bag to ftand up-  
right.” What would you think of that  
Prince, or of that Government, who fheuld  
iffue an edict forbidding you to drefs like a  
Gentleman or a Gentlewoman, on pain of  
imprifonment or fervitude ? Would you not  
fay that you were free, have a right to drefs  
as you pleafe, and that fuch an edict would  
be a breach of your privileges, and fuch a  
Government tyrannical? And yet you are  
about to put yourfelf under that tyranny,  
when you run in debt for fuchdrefs! Your  
creditor has authority, at his pleafure, to de-  
prive you of your liberty, by confining you  
in gaol for life, or by felling you for a fer-  
vant, if you thould not be able to pay him.  
When you have got your bargain, you may,  
perhaps, think little of payment, but ¢ Cre-  
ditors have better memories than Debtors ;  
Creditors are a fuperftitious fe&amp;t, great obfer-  
vers of fet days and times.” The day comes  
round before you are aware, and the de-  
mand is made before you are prepared to  
fatisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind,  
the term, which at firtt {eemed fo long, will,  
as it leflens, appear extremely fhort: Time  
will feem to have added wings to his heels as  
well as his fhoulders. ¢ Thofe havea fhort  
Lent, who owe money tobe paid at Eafter.”  
At prefent, perhaps, you may think your-  
felves in thriving circumftances, and that  
ou can bear a little extravagance without  
  
injury ; but  
‘ Forage and want fave while you may  
  
No morning fun lafts a whole day.”  
Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but  
ever, while you live, expence is conftant  
and certain; and * It is eafier to build  
two chimneys than to keep one in fuel.

It is the ftone that will turn all your lead  
into gold.”  
  
And, when you have got the philofopher’s  
ftone, fure you will no longer complain of  
bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.  
  
This doétrine, my friends, is reafon and  
wifdom ; But, after all, do not depend too  
much upon your own induftry, and frugali-  
ty, and prudence, though excellent things,  
for they may all be blafted, without the blef-  
fing of Heaven ; and therefore afk that  
blefling humbly, and be not uncharitable  
to thofé that at prefent feem to want it,  
but comfort and help them. Remem-  
ber, Job fuffered, and was afterwards pro-  
fperous.  
  
And now te coriclude, ¢ Experience keeps  
a dear fchool, but fools will learn in no o-  
ther, and fcarce in that ; for, it is true, we  
may give advice, but we cannot cannot give  
conduét ;’ However, remember this, ¢ They

ed ;” and farther, ¢ That, if you will net  
  
The Compendious Peerage of England,  
  
hear reafon, fhe will furely tap your  
knuckles.”  
  
Thus the old Gentleman ended his ha~-  
rangue. The people heard it, and approved  
the degtrine, and immediately practifed the  
contrary, juft as if it had been a common  
fermon ; for the auétion opened, and they  
began to buy extravagently.—I found the  
good man had thoroughly ftudied my Alma-  
nacks, and digefted all I had dropped on  
thofe topics during the courfe of twenty-five  
years. ‘The frequent mention he made of  
me muft have tired any one elie, but my va-  
nity was wonderfully delighted with it, tho”  
I was confcious that not a tenth part of the  
wifom was my own which he afcribed to  
me, but rather the gleanings that I had made  
of the fenfe of all ages and nations:  
However, I refolved to be the better for the  
echo of it, and, though [ had firft deter-  
mined to buy ftuff for a new coat, I went  
away refolved to wear my old one a little  
longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the fame,

then how much I mutt have been gratified  
by_an incident I am gving te relate to  
  
you. I {topped my horfe lately whereva  
  
great number of people were collected at  
an auétion of merchants goods.. The hour  
of the falenot being come, they were con-  
verfing on the badnefs of the times, and  
one of the company called to a plain clean  
old man, with white locks, “* Pray Fa-  
  
ther Abraham, what think you,ofthe |  
  
times? Will not thefe heavy taxes quite  
ruin-the country? How we be ever  
able to pay them? What would you ad-  
vife us to?” —Father Abraham ftood up,  
and replied, ‘* If you~would. have my  
advice I will give it you in fhort, for a  
‘word to the wite is enough.” ‘They join-  
ed in defiring him to {peak his mind,  
and gathering round him, he proceeded  
  
as follows &gt;  
  
Friznos, fays he, the taxes ate, in-  
deed, very heavy, and, if thofe&#x27;laid on  
by the government were the —_ ones  
we had to pay, we might more ealily dif-  
  
_charge them; but we have many others,  
  
and much more grievous to fome of us.  
We are taxed twice as much by our idle  
nefs, three times as much by our pride,  
and four times as much by ourfolly:  
And from thefe taxes the commillioners  
cannot eafe or deliver us by allowing an  
abatement. However us a om to  
d advice, and fomething may be «tone  
foe us; “ God helps them,that help  
themfelves,” as poor Richard fays,  
  
It would be thought a hard goverument  
that fhould tax its people one tenth part  
of their time to be employed in its fer-  
vice. But idlenefs taxes many of us much  
more; floth, by bringing on difeafes, ab-  
folutely fhortens life. ** Sloth, like ruft,

If time be of all things the moft precious.  
waiting time muft be, as poor Richard  
days, the gveateft prodigality:” fince, as  
he elfewhere tells, ‘ Loft time is never  
found again; and what we call time e-  
nough, always proves little enough: Let  
us then up and be doing, and doing to  
the purpote; fo by diligence fhall we do  
more with lefs perplexity. Sloth makes  
ali.things dificult, but induftry all eafy,  
and, he that rifeth late, muft trot all  
day, and hall fcarce overtake his bufine(s  
at might: While lazinefs travels fo flow-  
ly, that poverty foon overtakes him.  
Drive thy. bufinefs, let not that drive  
thees and carly to bed, and early to rife,  
amakes a man hedlithy, wealthy, and  
wife.”’  
So what fignifies wifhing and hoping  
for better times? We may make theie  
times better if we beftir ourfelves. ‘* In-  
duftry need not with; and he that lives  
upon hope will die fafting. There are no  
gains without pains; then help hands,  
for I have no lands,” or if] have they are  
fmartly taxed. “ He that hath a trade  
hath an eftate; and he that hath a cal-  
‘ding hath an office of profit and honour ;’  
but then the trade mufb be worked at,  
and the calling well followed, or neither  
the eftate, nor the office, will enable us  
toe pay our taxes.—If we are induftrous  
we thall never ftarve; for, ‘at the work-  
ing man&#x27;s houfe hunger looks in, but dare  
not enter.’ Nor willthe Bailiff orthe Con-  
ftable enter, for ‘* induftry pays debts,  
while ‘defpair increafeth them.’ What  
‘though you have found no treafure, nor  
has any rich relation left you a legacy,  
** Diligence is the mother of good-luck,  
and God gives all things to induftry.  
‘Then plow deep, while fluggards fleep,  
and youthall havecorn to fell and to keep.’  
Work while it is called to-day, for you  
know not how much you may be hinder-  
ed to«morrow. ‘ One to-day is worth  
two to-mortows;’ and farther; never  
“ leave that till to-morrow which you  
can do to-day.” If you were a fervant,  
would you not be afhamed that a good  
matter fhould catch you idle? Are you  
then your own matter, ‘* Beafhamed to  
watch yourfelf idle,” when there is fo  
much to be done for yourfelf, your fami-  
ly, your country, and your king. Handle  
your tools without mittens; remember,  
** That the cat in gloves catches no  
mice.” It: istrue thereismuch to be done,  
and, perbaps, you are weak handed, but  
ftick to it fteadily, and you will {ee great  
effects, for “* Conftant dropping wears a-  
way ftomes, and by diligence and pati-  
  
a’ i  
  
ence the moufe ate in two th  
little ftrokes fell great oaks,” satear!  
  
Methinks I hear fome ‘of you fay,  
** Muft a man afford himéelf no leifure?”  
—I will tell thee, my friend, what poor  
Richard fays, ‘* Employ thy time wel if  
thou meaneft to gain leifure; and, fince  
thou art not fureofa minute, throw nota-  
way an hour.” Leifure is time’ for doing  
fomething ufeful; this leifure the dili-  
gent man will obtain, but the lazy man  
never; for * A life of leifure and a life  
of lazine{s are two things. Many without  
labour would live by their wits only, but  
they break for want of ftock.”” Whereas  
induftry gives comfort, and plenty, and  
refpect. ‘* Fly pleafures and they will fol-  
low you. The diligent {pinner has a large  
fhift ; and now I have a theep and a cow,  
every body bids me good-morrow.”  
  
But with our indui{try we mult likewife  
be fteady, fettled, and careful, and over-  
{ee our own affairs*with our own eyes, and  
not truft too much to others; for  
  
* 1 never faw an oft removed tree,  
  
* Nor yet an oft removed family,  
  
* That throve fo well as thole that  
  
* fettled be.’  
And again, ‘‘ Three removes is as bad  
  
‘asa fire;” and again, ** Keep thy thop,  
  
and thy fhop will keep thee;” and again,  
** If you would have your bufinefs done,  
go; if not, fend.” And again,  
  
* He that by the plough would thrive,  
  
* Himfelf mutt either hold or drive.’  
And again, “ The eye of a matter will  
do more work than both his hands;”  
and again, “* Want of care does us more  
damage than want of knowledge :” and  
again, ** Not to overfee workmen is to  
Jeave them your purfe open.” Trufting  
too much to others care is the ruin of  
many;. for, ‘* In the affairs of titis  
world, men are faved, not by faith, but  
by the want of it ;” but a man’s own care  
is profitable; for, ** If you would have  
a faithful fervant, and one that you like,  
ferve yourfelf. A little negleé&amp; may  
breed great mifchief; for want of a

horfe was loft; and for want of a horfe  
the rider was loft ;” being overtaken and  
flain by the enemy; all for want of care  
about a horfe-fhoe nail. j  
  
So much for induftry, my friends,  
and attention.to one’s own bufinefs; but  
to thefe we mutt add frugality, if we  
would make our induftry more certain  
fuccefsful. A man may, ‘if he knows  
not how to fave as he gets, “ Keep his  
nofe all his life to the grindftone, and  
die not worth a groat at laft.” A i

‘ And men for punch forfook hewing

“ If you would be wealthy, think of  
  
faving, as well as of getting: ‘The In-  
  
&amp; have not made Spain rich, becaufe,  
out-goes are greater than her in-  
  
comes.”  
  
Away, then, with your expenfive fol-  
lies, and yon will not then have fo much  
caufe to complain of hard times, heavy  
taxes, and chargeable families ; for,  
  
* Women and wine, game and deceit,  
  
* Make the wealth fmall, and the want  
* great.”  
  
And farther, ‘‘ What maintains one  
yice,. would bring up two children.”  
You may think, pethaps, that a little  
tea, or a little punch now and then,  
diet a little more coftly, cloaths a little  
finer, and a little entertainment now  
  
‘and then, can be no great matter; but  
  
remember, ‘* Many a little makes a  
mickle; beware of little expences; a  
fmall leak will fink a great thip;” and  
again, ** Who dainties love fhall beggars  
prove;” and moreover, ‘* Fools make  
feafis; and wife men eat them.”  
  
Here you are all got together at this  
fale of fineries&#x27;and nick-nacks. You call  
them goods, but if you do not take care,  
they will prove evils to fome of you.  
You expect they willbe fold cheap, and  
perhaps, they may for lefs than they  
  
; but if you have no occafion for  
them; they muft be dear to you. Re-  
member what poor Richard fays, ** Buy  
what thou haft no need of, and ere long  
thou thalt fell thy neceflaries.” And a-  
gan, “ Ata great pennyworth paufe a  
while.” He means, that perhaps the  
cheapnefs is apparent only, and not  
teul; or the bargain, by ftraitening thee  
  
thy bufinefs, may do thee more harm  
than good. For in another place he  
fays, ** Many have been ruined by buy-  
ing good pennyworths.” Again, ‘ It is  
foolith to lay out money in a purchafe of  
Fepentance ;” and yet this folly is prac-  
tied every day at auctions, for want of  
Minding the Almanack. Many a one,  
for the fake of finery on the back, have  
gene with a hungry belly, and half ftarv-  
ed their families; ‘* Silks and fattins,  
  
let and velvets, put out the kitchen  
fire.” Thefe are not the neceffaries of  
life ; they can fcarcely be called the con-  
Veniencies, and yet, only becaufe they  
  
k pretty, how many want to have  
them? By thefe, and other extravagan-  
cies, the genteel are reduced to poveity,

and forced to borrow of thofe whom they  
formerly defpifed, but who, through in-  
duftry and frugality, have maintained  
their ftanding ; in which cafe it appears  
pisialy, that “* A’ Ploughman on his  
egs is higher than a Gentleman on his  
knees.” Perhaps they have had a fmall  
eflate left them, which they knew not  
the getting of ; they think “ It is day,  
and will never be night ;” thata little to  
be fpent out of fo much is not worth -  
minding ; but always taking out of the  
meal-tub, and never putting in, foon  
comes to the bottom; and then, ** When  
the well is dry, they know the worth of  
the water.” But this they might have  
known before, if they had taken his ad-  
vice; “* If you would know the value of  
money, go and try to borrow fome; for  
he that goes ‘a borrowing goes a forrow-  
ing ;&quot; and, indeed, fo does he that lends  
to fuch people, when he goes to get it in  
again.—Poor Dick farther advifes, and  
fays, ;  
Fond pride of drefsis fure a curfe;  
‘ Ere fancy you confult, confult your  
‘ purfe”  
  
And again, ‘* Pride isas loud a beggar  
as Want, anda great deal more faucy.”  
When you have bought one fine thing,  
you muft buy ten more, that your ap-  
pearance may be all ofa piece ; ‘but poor  
Dick fays, “ It is: eafier to fapprefs the  
firft defire, than to fatisfy all that follow _  
it.” And it is as truly folly for the poor  
to ape the rich, as the frog to fwell, in  
order to equal the ox. &#x27; :  
  
‘ Veflels large may venture more,  
  
© But little boats fhould keep near fhore.”  
It is, however, a felty foon punithed ;  
for “ Pride that dines on vanity, fups  
on contempt; Pride breakfafted with  
plenty, dined with poverty, and fupped  
with infamy.” And, after all, of what  
ufe is this pride of appearance for which  
fo much is rifqued, {) much is fuffered ?  
It cannot promote health, nor eafe pain;  
it makes no increafe of merit in the pere  
fon, it creates envy, it haitens misfor-  
tune.  
But what madnefs muft it be to run in  
debt for thefe fuperfiuities! We are of-.  
fered, by the terms of this fale, fix  
months credit; and that, perhaps, has  
induced fome of us to attend it, becaufe  
we cannot fpare the ready money, and  
hope now to be fine without it. But ah!  
think what you do when you run in  
debt; you give to another power over  
your liberty. If you cannot pay at the  
  
time, you will be albamed to fee your  
creditor ; you will be in fear when. you  
  
fpeak to him; you will make poor oe  
  
  
  
  
  
422 Curious Addrefs  
  
ful fneaking exeufes, and, by degrees,  
come to lofe your. veracity, and fink into  
bafe downright lying, for, ‘‘ The fe-  
cond vice is lying, the firit is running in  
debt.” And again, to the fame purpofe,  
** Lying. rides upon Debt’s back.”  
Whereas a free-born Englifhman ought  
not to be afhamed nor afraid to fee or  
{peak to any man living. But poverty  
often deprives a man of all fpirit, and  
virtue. ‘ It is hard for an empty bag  
to ftand upright.” What would you  
think of that Piince, or of that Govern-  
ment, who fhould iffue an ediét forbid-  
ding you to drefs like a Gentleman or a  
pa ba Mat mg on pain of imprifonment  
or fervitude ? Would you not fay that  
you were free, have a right to drefs as  
you pleafe, and that fuch an ediét would  
be 4 breach of your privileges, and fuch  
a Government tyrannical? And yet you  
are about to put yourfelf under that ty-  
ranny, when you run in debt for fuch  
drefs! Your creditor has authority, at  
his pleafure, to deprive you of your li-  
berty, by confining you in goal for life,  
or by felling you for a fervant, if you  
fhould not be able to pay him. When  
you have got your bargain, you may,  
perhaps, think little of payment; but  
** Creditors have better memories than  
Debtors; Creditors are a fuperftitious  
fect, great obfervers of fet days and  
times.” ‘The day comes round before  
you are aware, and the demand is made  
before you are prepared to fatisfy it; or  
if you bear your debt in mind, the term,  
which at firft feemed fo long, will, as it  
leilens, appear extremely hort: Time  
will feem to haye added wings to his  
heels as well as his thoulders. ‘* Thofe  
have a fhort Lent, who owe money. to be  
paid at Eafter.” At prefent, perhaps,  
you may think yourfelves in thriving cir-  
comftances, apd that you can beara lit-  
tle extravagance without injury; but,  
  
‘ For age and want fave while you may;  
* No morning fun lafts a whole day,’  
Gain may be temporary and uncertain,  
but ever, while you live, expence is con-  
ftant and certain; and, “ It is eafier to  
build two chimneys than to keep one in  
fucl.” So‘ rather go to bed fupperleis  
than rife in debt :’  
  
¢ Get what you can, and what you get  
* hold,  
  
¢ It isthe ftone that will turn all your

And when you have got the Philofopher’s  
fione, fare you will no longer complain  
  
  
  
in an Auétion-Room.  
  
of bad times, or the difficulty of payj  
taxes*. vy 0% Paying  
  
&quot;This doétrine, my friends, is reafon  
and wifdom: But, after all, do not de  
pend too much upon your own induftry,  
and frugality, and prudence, though  
excellent things, for they may all be  
blafted, without the bleffing of Heaven ;  
and therefore afk that blefling humbly,  
and be not uncharitable to thofe that at  
prefent feem to want it, but. comfort  
and help them. Remember, Job fuffer~  
ed, and was afterwards profperous.  
  
And now to conclude, ‘* Experience  
keeps a dear fchool, but fools will learn  
in no other, and fcarce in that; for, it  
is true, we may give advice, but we can-  
not give condpét :’’ However, remember  
this, ** They that will not be counfelled,  
cannot be helped ;” and farther, ** That  
if you will not hear reafon, the will fare-  
ly tap your knuckles.”  
  
Thus the old Gentleman ended his ha+  
rangue. ‘The people heard it:and ap-  
proved the doétrine, and immediately  
prattifed the contrary, juft as if it had  
been a common fermon; for the Auc+  
tion opened, and they began to buy ¢x-  
travagantly.—I found the good man had  
thoroughly ftudied my Almanacks, and  
digefted all I had dropped on thofe.to-  
pics during the courfe of twenty-five  
years. The frequent mention he made  
of me muft have tired any one elfe, but  
my yanity was wonderfully delighted  
with it, though I was confcious that not  
a tenth part of the wifdom was my own  
which he afcribed to me, but rather, the  
gleanings that I had made of the fenfe of  
all ages and nations: However, I refolved  
to be the better for the echo of it, and,  
though I had firft determined to, buy  
{tuff for a new coat, I went away refolved  
to wear my old one&#x27;a little longer. Rea  
der, if thou wilt do the fame, thy profit  
will b¢ as great as mine. Iam, as ever,  
thine to ferve thee,

“ Many have been rnincil by buying

haps they have had a fmill eftate left  
them, which they knew not the getting  
of; they think “ It is day, and will neuT  
he night;” that a little to befpent out of  
fo much is not worth minding : “ A child  
and a fool (as poor Richard fays) ima¬  
gine twenty ftiiilings and twenty years  
can never be fpent, but always be taking  
out of the meal-tub, and never putting  
in, foon comes to the bottom ;” then,  
as poor Dick fays, “ When the well is  
dry, they know the worth of water.”  
Hut this they might have known before,  
if they had taken his advice; “ If you  
would know the value of money, go and  
try to borrow Tome ; for he that knows  
a borrowing goes a forrowing ; and, in¬  
deed, fo does he that lends to fiich peo¬  
ple when he goes to get it in again.”  
Poor Dick farther ailvifes, and fays,  
  
“ Fond pride of drefs, is fin e a very  
cm fe;  
  
F.rc fancy you confult, confuU your  
piirlc.’’  
  
And again, “ Pride is as loud a beggar  
.IS Want, and a great deal more fancy.”  
\N’htn you have bought one fine thing,  
you muft buy ten more, that your ap¬

“ VelTels large may venture more,

’Tis however a folly foon puniflied;  
for “ Pride that dines on V^anity, flips

then, how much I muft have been gratified by an incident |  
am going to relate to you. I {topped my horfe lately, wher  
a great number of people were collected at an auction of mer-  
chants goods. ‘The hour of the fale not being come, they were  
converfing on the badnefs of the times; and one of the com-  
pany called to a plain, clean Old Man, with white locks, “ Pray,  
Father Abraham, what think you of the times? Will not thefe .  
heavy taxes quite ruin the country ? How fhall we ever be able  
to pay them ? What would you advife us to ?” Father Abra-  
ham ftood up, and replied, * If you would have my advice, I  
will give it you in fhort; ‘* for a word to the wife is enough,”  
as Poor Richard fays.’ They joined in defiring him to fpeak his  
mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows :  
  
‘ Friends, fays he, the taxes are, indeed, very heavy, and,  
if thofe laid on by the government were the only ones we had  
to pay, we might more eafily difcharge them ; but we have  
many others, and much more grievous to fome of us. We ase  
taxed twice as much by our idlenefs, three times as much by  
our pride, and four times as much by our folly ; and from thefe  
taxes the commiffioners cannot cafe or deliver us, by allowing  
an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and  
fomething may be done for us; ‘* God helps them that help  
themfelves,” as Poor Richard fays.  
  
‘ It would be thought a hard government that fhould tax  
its people one-tenth part of their time, to be employed in its  
fervice ; but idlenefs taxes many of us much more; floth, by  
bringing on difeafes, abfolutely fhortens life. ** Sloth, like  
ruft, confumes fafter than Jabour wears, while the ufed key is  
always bright,” as Poor Richard fays. ‘* But doft thou love lifts  
  
then do not fquander tise, for that is the fluff life is mad¢ ay

as Poor Richard fays. How much more than is neceflary do  
we fpend in fleep | forgetting that, ** The fleeping fox catches  
no poultry, and that there will be fleeping enough in the grave,”  
as Poor Kichard fays.  
  
« If time be of all things the moft precious, wafting time  
mutt be,” as Poor Richard fays, ‘* the greateft prodigality ;”  
fince, as he elfewhere tells us, ** Loft time is never found  
goain; and what we call time enough, always proves little  
enoach -’ let us then up and be doing, and doing to the pur-  
ofe; fo by diligence fhall we do more with lefs perplexity.  
s Sloth makes all things difficult, but induftry all eafy; and,  
He that rifeth late, muft trot all day, and fhall fearce overtake  
his bufinefs at night; while lazinefs travels fo flowly, that po-  
verty foon overtakes him. Drive thy bufinefs, let not that drive  
thee ; and early to bed, and early to rife, makes a man healthy,  
wealthy, and wife,” as Poor Richard fays.  
  
© So what fignifies wifhing and hoping for better times? We  
may make thefe times better, if we beftir ourfelves. ‘* Induftry  
need not wifh, and he that lives upon hope will die fafting.  
There are no gains without pains ; then help hands, for I have  
  
_ nolands,” or, if I have, they are fmartly taxed. “** He that  
  
hath a trade, hath an eftate; and he that hath a calling, hath  
an office of profit and honour,” as Poor Richard fays; but then  
the trade muft be worked at, and the calling well followed, or  
neither the eftate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes.  
—If we are induftrious, we fhall never ftarve; for, ** at the  
working man’s houfe hunger looks in, but dares not enter.”  
Nor will the bailiff or the conftable enter, for ‘* Induftry pays  
debts, while Defpair increafeth them.”” What though you have  
found no treafure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy,  
“Diligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things  
to induftry. Then plow deep, while fluggards fleep, and you  
fhall have corn to fell and to keep.” Work while it is called  
to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered to-  
morrow. ** One to-day is worth two to-morrows,” as Poor  
Richard fays ; and farther, ** Never leave that till to-morrow,  
which you can do to-day.” If you were a fervant, would you  
not be afhamed that a good matter fhould catch you idle? Are  
you then your own aie ? be afhamed to catch yourfelf idle,  
when there is fo much to be done for yourfelf, your family,  
your country, and your king. Handle your tools without mit-  
‘ens, remember, that, ** The cat in gloves catches no mice,”  
as Poor Richard fays. It is true, there is much to be done, and,  
perhaps, you are weak-handed ; but ftick to it fteadily, and you  
will fee great effeéts; for ** Conftant dropping wears away  
ftones ; and by diligence and patience the moufe ate in two the  
cable; and little ftrokes fell great oaks,”

is foolifh to lay out money in a purchafe of repentance ;” and  
yet this folly is praétifed every day at auctions, for want of

Courteous Reader,  
  
HAVE heard that nothing gives  
  
an author fo great pleafuré as to  
  
find his works refpeétful ly guoted  
by other fearned authors. is  
pleafure I have felcom enjoyed; for  
  
though I have been, if I may fay it  
without vanity, an Eminent author  
(of almanacks) afduaily new a full  
quarter of a century, my brother  
authors in the fame way, for wiiat

befides, in my rambles, where I aa  
not perfonally Known, I lave fre  
quently heard one or other of my  
adapes repeated, with, as poor Rica.

Judge thea how muchI muff have

a  
  
  
  
  
  
and gathering round him,he proceed -  
¢d as follows :  
  
Friends, (ayshe, and neighbours,  
the taxes are indeed very heavy,  
and if thofe laid on by tne govern-  
ment were the only ones we had to  
pay, we might more eafily difcharge  
them; but we have many others,  
and much more grievous to fome of  
us. We are taxed twice as much by  
our idlenefs, three times as much by  
our pride, acd four times as mach  
by our folly ; and from thefe taxes  
the commiffioners cannot eafe or de-  
liver us, by allowing an abatement.  
However let us hearken to good ad-  
vice, and fomething may be done for  
us, ** God helps them that help them-  
felves,” as poor Richard fays, in his  
almanack for 1733.  
  
It would be thought a hard go-  
vernment that fhould tax its people  
one tenth part of their time, to be  
employed in its fervice. But idie-  
nefs taxes many of us much more,  
if we reckon all that is {pent in ab-  
folure floth, or doing of nothing,  
with that which is fpent in idle em-  
pleyments or amufements, that  
amount to nothing. Sloth, by  
bringing on difeafes, abfolutely  
Shortens life. * Sloth, like ruft, con-  
fumes fafler than labour wears,  
while the ufed key‘is always bright,”  
as poor Richard fays. Butdoft thou  
Jove life, then do not fquander time,  
for thisis the fluff life 1s made of, as  
poor Richard fays. How much more  
than is neceflary do we fpend in  
fleep! forgetting that, “ the fleep-  
ing fox catches no poultry, and that  
there will be fleeping enough in the  
grave,” as poor Richard fays. ‘ If  
time be of al| things the moft preci-  
ous, wafting time muft be, as poor  
Richard fays, the greateft prodigali-  
y»” fince, as he elfewhere tells us,  
** Loft time is never found again ;  
aod what we cal! time enough, al-  
ways proves littleenough.” Let us  
then be up and doing, and doing to  
the purpofe ; fo by diligence fhall  
we do more with lefs perplexity.  
¢¢ Sloth makes all things difficult,  
bat induftry eafy, as poor Richard  
fays; and he that rifes late, muft  
trot all day, and fhall fcarce over-  
take his bufinefs at night. While  
Jazine(s travels fo flowly, that po-  
  
‘&lt;2 On Oceconomy and brugaiity.  
  
verty foon overtakes him,” as we  
read 19 poor Richard, who ‘adds,  
‘‘ drive thy bufine(s,let not that drive  
thee; and eaily to bed, and early to  
rife, make a man healthy, wealthy,  
and wife.”  
  
So that what fignifies wifhing and  
hoping for better times? We may  
make thefe times better if we beftir  
ourfelves. Induftry needs not with,  
as poor Richard fays, and he that  
lives upon hope will die fafting.  
There are no gains without pains ;  
“then help hands for I have no  
lands,” or if I have they are {mart-  
ly taxed. And, as poor Richard  
likewife obferves, “* he that hath a  
trade hath an eftate, and he that hath  
a calling hath an office of profit and  
honour; but then the trade muft  
be worked at, and the calling well  
followed, or neither the eflate, nor  
the office will enable usto pay our  
taxes. If we. are indufirious we  
fhall never ftarve ; for, as poor  
Richard fays, ** At the working  
man’s houfe, hunger looks in, but  
dares not enter.” Nor will the  
bailiff or the conftable enter, for  
‘‘ induftry pays debts, while defpair  
increafeth them,” fays poor Rich-  
ard. What though you have found  
no treafure, nor has any rich rela-  
tion left you a legacy, ** Diligence is  
the mother of good luck, as poor  
Richard fays, and God gives al  
things to induftry. ,Then plough  
deep while fluggards fleep, and you  
fhall have corn to fell and to keep,”  
fays poor Dick. Work while it is  
called to-day, for you know not how  
much you may be hindered to-mor-  
row, which makes poor Richard fay,  
‘© One to day is worth two to-mor-  
rows;” and farther, ** have you  
fomewhat to do to morrow, do it  
to-day.” If you were a fervant,  
would you not be afhamed a good  
maftey fhould catch you idle? Are  
you then your own mafter, “ and not  
afhamed to cateh yourfelf idle,’ as  
poor Dick fays. When there is fo  
much to be done for yourfelf, your  
family, your country, and your gra-  
cious king, be up by peepof day ;  
*¢ Let not the fun look downand fay,  
ingiorious here he lies.” Handle  
your tools without mittens; remem-  
ber that the cat ip gloves Catches no  
  
mice,”  
  
  
  
  
  
On Occoncmy and Frugality.  
  
mice,” as poor Richard fays. ’Tis  
true there is much to be done, and  
perhaps you are weak handed, but  
flick to it Readily, and you will (ee  
great effects, for * conitant drop.  
ping wears away ftones, and by di-  
ligence and patience the moufe eat  
into the cable; and little ftrokes feil  
great oaks,” as poor Richard fays in  
his almanack, the year I cannot juit  
now remember. |  
  
Methinks I hear fome of you fay,  
« muft a man afford himfeli no lei-  
fure?” I will teil thee, my friend,  
what poor Richard fays, “ Employ  
thy time well if thou meavef to  
gain leifure ; and fince thou art not  
{ure of a minute, throw not away an  
hour.” Leifure, is time doing fome-  
thing ufeful; this leifure, the dili-  
gent man will obtain, but the lazy  
man never; fo that, as poor Rich-  
ard faysy “* a life of leifure and a life  
of lazinefs are two things.” Do you  
imagine that floth wiil afford you  
more comfort than labour? No, for,  
as poor Richard fays, ‘* Treuble  
fprings from idlenefs, and grievous  
toil from needlefs eafe. Many with-  
out labour, would live by their wits  
only, but they break tor want of  
flock.” Whereas indoftry gives  
comfort, and plenty and refpect:  
«Fly pleafures, and they will fol-  
low you. The diligent {pinner has  
a large thift ; and now I havea fheep  
and a cow, every body bids me  
good-morrow ;” all which is well  
faid by poor Richard.  
  
But with our indufiry, we muft  
likewile be fleady, fettied, and care  
ful,and overfee our own affairs with  
our own eyes, and not truft too much  
  
to others ; for, as poor Richard  
fays,  
  
‘* T never faw an oft removed tree,  
  
** Nor yet an oft removed family,  
  
“ That thrive fo well as thofe that  
fettled be.’  
  
And again, ** Three removes is ag  
bad as a fire;’? and again, * keep  
thy fhop, and thy fhop will keep  
thee ;” and again, “ if you would  
have your bufinefs done, go; if not,  
fend; and again,  
  
7  
  
‘¢He that by the plough would  
  
thrive,  
“ Himfelf muff either hold or drive.”  
  
And again, “ the eye of the mafter  
will do more work than both his  
hands ;’? and again, ‘‘ want of care  
does us more damage than want of  
koowledge ; and again, “ not to  
overfee workmen, is to leave them  
your purfe open.’? Trufling too  
much to others care is the ruin of

‘‘ in the affairs of this world, men  
are faved, not by faith, but by the

profitable ;” for, faith poor Dick,  
“learning i¢ to the fludious, and  
riches to the careful, as well as  
power to the bold, and heaven to  
the virtuous”® And further, * if  
you would have a faithful fervant,  
and one that you like, ferve your-  
felf.? And again, he advifeth to  
circumfpedion and care, even in the  
{malleft matters, becaufe fometimes,  
a little neglect may breed great  
mifchief ; adding, for want of a nail

the horfe was loft; and for want of  
a horfe the rider was loft,” being  
overtaken aod flain by the enemy ;  
allfor want of care about a horfe-

So muchfor indufiry,my friends,and  
attention to one’s own bufinefs ; but  
to thefe we muft add frugality, if we  
would make our induftry more cer-  
tainly fuccefsful. A man may, if he  
knows not how to fave as he gets,  
keep his nofe all his life to the grind.

But what madnefs muff it beto  
roo in debt for thefe fuperflurtees !  
We are offered, by the termsof this  
veodue, fix months cred:t ; and that  
rerliaps has induced fome of us to  
attend it, becaufle we cannot fpare  
the ready Money, and hope now to  
te fre without it. But ah, think  
what you do when you run im debt ;  
you give to another power over  
yourlberty. If you canno’ pay  
the time, you will be afhamed to fee  
your creditor ; you will be in fear  
when you fpeak to him; you will  
nake poor pitiful fnecking excules,  
and by Gegrees come to lofe your  
veracity, and &amp;ok into bate down  
richt lying ; for as poor R chard  
fays, “the fecond vice islyime, the  
frit is running indebt.””. And again  
to the fame purpofe, * lying rides  
upon debt’s back.??” Whievreas a free-  
bora American ov; 2lt poet to be a-  
fhamed or afraid toiceor fpeak to any  
man living. But poverty often de-  
prives a man of all (pirit and virtue ;  
‘at is hard for an empty bag to  
peor Richard  
troly fays. . What would you think  
of that prince or that government,  
  
  
  
and Frugality. 15  
  
who would iffue an edi&amp; forbidding  
you to crefs likea gentleman, or a  
pentlewomen, on pain of imprifon-  
ment or fervitude?, Would you not  
fay, that you arefree, have a nghe  
to drefs as you pleale, and that fuch  
an edi wouid be a breach of your  
privileges, and (uch a government  
tyranacal? and y«t you are about to  
pure yourfelf uncer that tyranny  
when you ran in debt for fuch drefs!  
Your creditor has authority at his  
pieafure to deprive you of your li-  
herty, by Confning you in goal for  
life, or by felling you for a tervant,  
if you fhould not be able to pay him.  
Wien you have got your bargain,  
you may perhaps, think Iittle of pay-  
ment; but ‘creditors, as poor Dick  
telisus, have better memories than  
deb‘ors 5”? and in ano her place fays,  
‘(creditors are a fuperftitious fea,  
great obfervers of fet days and times.”  
Tie day comes round before you  
are aware, avd the demand is made  
before you are prepared to fatisfy it.  
O: if you bear your debt in mind,  
the term which at frft feemed fo  
long, will, as it &#x27;effems, appear ex-  
tremely fhort. Time will feem to  
bive added wings to his heels as well  
os fhoulders, ‘* Thofe have a fhore  
Lent, faith que Richard, who owe  
money to be paid at Eater.” - Then  
ast ‘* the borrower is  
a ilave tothe lender, andthe debtor  
to the creditor,’’ difdain the chan,  
preferve your freedom ; and man-  
tain your independency : be induf-  
trious and free ; be frugal and  
free. At prefent, perhaps, you may  
tomk yourtelf in thriving circum-  
ances, and that you can bear a little  
extravagance without injury; but,

As poor Rhichard fays, gain may  
be temporary and uncertain, but  
ever while you live, expence is Con-  
fant and certain; and “ *tis eafier

«¢ Get what you can,and what’s got,  
fairly inold ;  
  
s6oTis the fione thet will turn all  
your lead into gold.”  
  
As poor Richard fays. And when  
you have got the pnilopher’s ftone,  
fure you will no longer complain of  
bad times, or the difficulty of pay-  
ing taxes,  
  
This do€rine, my friends, is rea  
fon and wifdom ; but after all, do  
not depend too mich upon your  
own induftry, and frugality, aod  
prudence, though exceilent things,  
for they may all be biafed without  
the bieffing of heaven; and there-  
fore afk that blefling humbly, and be  
not uncharitabie to thofe that at  
  
refent feem to want it, but comfort  
and help them. Remember Job  
fuifered, and was afterwatds prof-  
perous. fail  
  
And now to conclude, * experi.  
ence keeps a dear {chool, bur fools  
willlearnin no other, and fcarce in  
that; for it is true, we may give ad-  
vice bot we cannot give condéa,”  
as poor Richard fays : however re-  
member this, ‘ they that will not,  
be counfelled, cannot be helped,”  
as poor Richard fays: and farther,  
*‘ that if you will not hear reafon  
fhe will furely rap your knucklés.’”  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his  
harrangue. The people heard it,  
and approved the doéttrine ; but  
immediately prattifed the contrary,  
juft as if it had been acummon fer-  
mon ; for the vendue opened, and  
they began to buy extravagantly,  
not withfianding all his cautions, and  
their own fear of taxes. I found J  
the good man had thoroughly ftudi-  
ed my almanacks, and digefted all I  
had dropt on thofe topics during the |  
courfe of five and twenty years. The  
frequeut mewtion he made of me  
muft*havé tired any one elfe, but my  
vanity Was wonderfully delighted  
withit, though I was confcious that,  
not a tenth part of the wifdom was  
my own which he afcribed to me,  
but rather the gléanings I had made  
of tie fenfe of all ages and nations.  
However | refalved to be the better  
for the echo of it ; and though I had  
at firft determined to buy fiuff for a  
newcoat, 1 went away refolving to  
wear my old one a little longer.  
Reader, if thou wilt do the fame, iny  
profit wilt be as great as mine.

indeed, very heavy; and, if thofe  
Jaid on by the government were the  
only ones we had to pay, we might  
more ealfily difcharge them ; but we  
have many others, and much more  
grievous to fome of us, We are  
taxed twice as much by our idlenefs,  
three times as much by our pride,  
and four times as much by our folly ;  
and from thefe taxes the commif-  
fioners cannot eale or deliver us, by  
allowing an abatement. However,  
Jet us hearken to good advice, and  
fomething may be done for us ;  
«© God helps them that help them-  
felves,” as Poor Richard fays.  
I. « It would be thought a hard  
government that fhould tax its peo-  
le one tenth part of their time, to  
Be employed in its fervice: But idle-  
nefs taxes many of us much more ;  
floth, by bringing on difeafes, abfo-  
lutely fhortens life. * Sloth, like  
ruft, confumes fafter than labour  
wears, while the ufed key is always  
bright,” as Poor Richard fays.—  
¢* But doft thou love life, then do  
not fquander time, for that is the  
ftuff life is made of,” as Poor Rich-  
ard fays—How much more than  
isneceflary do we [pend in fleep! for-  
getting that ** The fleeping fox catch-  
es no poultry, and that there will  
be fleeping enough in the grave,”  
as Poor Richard fays.  
* If time be of all things the moft  
Swacage wafting time mutt be,” as  
‘oor Richard fays, * the greateft  
prodigality ;” fince, as he elfewhere  
tells us, «¢ Loft time is never found  
again ;and what we call time enough  
always proves little enough :” Let us  
then up and be doing, and doing to  
the purpofe : So by diligence fhall  
we do more with lefs perplexity.  
* Sloth makes all things difficult,  
but induftry all eafy ; and, he that  
rifeth late, muft trot all day, and  
fhall fcarce overtake his bufinefs at  
night; while Lazinefs travels fo flow-  
ly, that Poverty foon overtakes him.  
  
Drive thy bufinefs, let not that drive  
thee ; and early to bed, and early to  
rife, makes a man healthy, wealthy,  
and wile,” as Poor Richard fays.  
‘So what fignifies wifhing and  
hoping for better times ? We may  
make thefe times better, if we beftir  
ourfelves. “Induftry need notwith,  
and he that lives upon hope will die  
fafting. There are no gains without  
pains ; then help hands, for I have  
no lands,” or, if I have, they are  
fmartly taxed. « Hethat hatha trade,  
hath ancftate;and he that hath a call-  
ing, hath an office of profitand hon-  
our,” as P ichard fays; butthen  
the tra worked at, and the  
calling lowed, or neither the  
eftate nor thé office willenable us to  
pay our taxes,—If we are induftri-  
ous we fhall never ftarve; for,  
‘atthe working man’s houfe hunger  
looks in, but dares not enter.” Nor  
will the bailiff or the conftable enter,  
for  Induitry pays debts, while def-  
pair encreafeth them.” Whatthough  
you have found no treafure, nor has  
any rich relation left you a legacy,  
‘* Diligence is the mother of good  
luck, and God gives all things to in-  
dultry. Then plow deep, while  
fluggards fleep, and you fhall have  
corn to fell and to keep.” Work  
while it iscalled to-day, foy you know  
not how much you may be hindcred  
to-morrow. One to-day is worth  
two to-morrows,” as Poor Richard  
fauys ; and farther, «* Never leave  
that ull to-morrow, which you can  
do to-day.&quot;&quot;—-If you were a fervant,  
would you not be afhamed that a  
good matter fhauld catch you idle ?  
Are you then yourown matter ? be  
afhamed to catch yourfelf idle when  
there is fo much to be done for your-  
felf, your family, your country, and  
yourking. Handle your tools with-  
out mittens: Remember, that «The  
cat in gloves catches no mice,” as  
Poor Richard fays. I+ is true, there  
is much to be done, and, per-  
haps,  
  
  
  
  
  
ard, introduces father Abraham for this purpofe. Hence it is, that Poor Richard is {

friends, and attention to  
one’s own bufincls ; but to thefe we  
muft add frugality, if we would  
make our induftry more certainly  
fuccefsful. A man may, if he knows  
not how to fave as he gets, * keep  
his nofe all his life to the grind-  
ftone, and die not worth a groat at  
laft. A fat kitching makes a lean  
will ;” and  
  
“* Many eitates are {pent in the getting,  
  
Since women for tea torfook {pinning and  
  
knitting,  
  
And —_ for punch forfook hewing and  
  
TUN.  
  
« If you would be wealthy, think  
of faving, as well as of getting. The  
Indies have not made Spain rich,  
becaufe her outgoes are greater than  
her incomes.”  
  
¢ Away, then, with your expen-  
five follies, and you will not then  
have fo much caufe to complain of  
hard times, heavy taxes, and charge-  
able families ; for  
  
** Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth imall, and the want  
  
great.’’  
And farther, ** What maintains one  
Vice, would bring up two children.”  
You may think, perhaps, that a little  
tea or a little punch now and then,  
diet alittle more coftly, clothes a lit-  
tie finer, and a little entertainment  
now and then, can be no great mat-  
ter; but remember, “ Many a little  
makes a mickle.” Beware of little  
éxpences ; “ A {mall leak will fink a  
great fhip,” as Poor Richard fays ;  
and again, ** Whodainties love, fhall  
beggars prove;” and moreover,  
«* Foo)s make feafts, and wife men eat  
them.” Here you are al! got together  
to this fale of fineries, and nicknacks,  
You call them goods ; but, if you do  
not take care, they will prove evils to  
fome of you. You expeé they will  
be fold cheap, and, perhaps, they  
may for lefs than they coft ; bur, if  
you have no occafion forthem, they  
  
muft be dear to you. Remember  
what Poor Richard fays, “* Buy what  
thou haft no need of, and ere lon  
  
thou fhalt fell thy neceffaries.”’ And  
again, ** At a great penny worth  
paufe a while :” he means, that per-  
haps the cheapnefs is apparent only,  
and not real ; or the pecan by  
{traightening thee in thy bufineds,  
may do thee more harm than good.  
For in another place he fays, ** Many  
have been ruined by buying good  
pennyworths.”” Again, * It is fool-  
ifh to lay out money in a purchafe  
of repentance ;” and yet this folly is  
practifed every day at auétions, for  
want of minding the Almanack.  
Many aone, forthe fake of finery  
on the back, have gone with a hun-  
gry belly, and half {tarved their fam-  
ilies ; * Silks and {atins, {carlet and  
velvets, put out the kitchen fire,”  
as Poor Richard fays. Thefe are  
not the neceflaries of life ; they can  
{carcely be called the conveniences:  
And yet only becaufe they look  
pretty, how many want to have  
them ?——By thefe, and other extrav-  
agancies, the genteel are reduced to  
poverty, and forced to borrow of  
thofe whom they formerly defpifed,  
but who, through induaftry and fru-  
gality, have maintained their ftand-  
inig ;1n which cafe it appears plainly,  
that * A ploughman on his legs 18  
higher than a gentleman on his  
knees,” as Poor Richard fays. Per-  
haps they have had a {mall eftate  
left them, which they knew not the  
getting of ; they think * It is day,  
and never will be night ;” that a lit-  
tle to be {pent out ef fo much is not  
worth minding ; but “ Always tak-  
ing out of the meal tub, and never  
putting in. foon comes to the bot-  
tom,” as Poor Richard fays; and  
then, “* When the well is dry, they  
know the worth of water.” But

they had taken hisadvice. “Ifyou  
would know the value of money,  
go and try to borrow fome ; for he  
that goes a horrowing, goesa forrow-  
ing,” as Poor Richard fays ; and, in-  
deed, fo does he that lends to fuch  
ople, when he goes to get it again.  
oor Dick father advifes, and fays,  
*¢ Fond pride of drefs is fure a very curfe 3  
Ere fancy you confult, contu&#x27;t your purfe.””  
And again, “ Pride is as loud a beg-  
gar as want, and a great deal more  
faucy.” When you have bought  
one fine thing, you mult buy ten  
more, that your appearance may be  
all of apiece ; but Poor Dick fays,  
« It is eafier to fupprefs t+: firft de-  
fire, than to fatisfy all that follow it.”  
And it is as truly folly for the poor  
to ape the rich, as for the frog to  
{well, in order to equal the ox,  
  
“6 Velfels larye may venture more,  
But little boars thould keep near fhore.”*  
  
It is, however, a folly foon punifh-  
ed ; for, as Poor Richard fays,  
« Pride that dines on vanity, fups  
oncontempt ; pride break falted with  
Plenty, dined with Poverty, and fup-  
ed with Infamy.” And, after all,  
of what ufe is this pride of appear-  
ance. for which fo much is niked,  
fo much is fuffered ? It cannot pro-  
mote health, nor eafe pain; it makes  
no increafe of merit in the perfon, it  
creates envy, it haftens misiortung,  
¢ But what madnefs it mult be to  
run in debt for thefe fuperfluites ?  
We are offered, by the terms of this  
fale, 1x months credit ;and that, per-  
haps. !ias induced fome of us to attend  
it, becaule we cannot {pare the ready  
money, and hope now to be fine  
without it; But ah! think what  
you do when you run in debt; you  
give to another power over your  
liberty. if you cannot pay at the  
time, you will be afhamed to fee  
your creditor ; you will be in fear  
when you {peak to him ; you will  
make poor pitiful fneaking excufes,  
and, by degrees, come to lofe your  
veracity, and fink into bale, dowa-  
  
right lying ; for * The fecond vice  
islying, the firft is running in debt,”  
as Poor Richard fays ; and again,to  
the fame purpole, « Lying rides up-  
on debts back :” Whereas a free born  
Englifhman ought not be afhamed  
nor afraid to fee or {peak to any  
man living. But poverty often de-  
prives a man of all {pirit and virtue,  
‘ Itis hard for an empty bag to ftand  
upright.” What would you think  
of that prince, or of that govem-  
ment, who fhould iffue an edi@ for:  
bidding you to drels like a gentle-  
man or gentlewoman, on pain of im-  
prilonment or fetvitude ? Would  
you not fay that you were free, have  
a right to drefs as you pleafe, and  
that fuch an edi&amp; would be a breach  
of your privileges, and {uch a govs  
ernment tyrannical? and yet you  
are about to put yourlelf under that  
tyranny, when you run in debt for  
fuch drefs ! Your creditor has aus  
thority, at his pleaiure, to deprive  
you of your bhorty, by conhning  
you in gaol for life, or by felling  
you for a fervant, if you fhould not  
be able to pay him. When you  
have got your bargain, you may,  
yn think a little of payment ;  
ut, as Poor Richard fays, «* Credite  
ors have better memories than debt-  
ors ; creditors are a fuperftitious  
fe&amp;, great obfervers of fet days and  
times.” The day comes round be-  
fore you are aware, and the demand  
is made before you are able to fatis«  
fy it; or, if you bear your debt in  
mind, the term which at farft feemed  
fo long, will, as it leflens, appear ex-  
tremely fhort: Time will feem to  
have added wings to his heels as well  
as his fhoulders. “ Thofe have a  
fhort lent, who owe money to be  
aid at Eafter.” At prefent, per-  
flies, you may think yourfelves in  
thriving circum{tances, and that you  
can bear a little extravagance with-  
out injury ; but  
** For age and want fave while you may,

¢ Gain may be temporary and un-  
certain, but ever, while you live, ex-  
pente is contt int and certain ; and,  
«It is eafier to build two chimnies,  
thanto keep one in fuel,” as Poor  
Richard fays: So, “ Rather go to  
bed fupperleis, than rife in debt,  
  
Ge: wha. you cany and what you gethold,  
  
“J is the tone ihac wil turn all your lead

And when vou have got the philo-  
fepher’s ftone, {ure you will no long-  
er complain of bad times, or the dif-  
ficulty of paying taxes,

is reafon and wifdom: But, after  
all, do not depend too much upon  
your own indultry, and frugality,  
aiid prudence, though excellent  
things ; for they may all be blafted  
without the bieffing of heaven; and  
therefore, afk the bleffling humbly,  
and be not uncharitable to thote that  
  
lat preien feem to want it, but com-  
fért and help them. Remember,  
Job fuffered, and was afterwards  
profperous,  
  
* And now to conclude, ** Expe-  
rience keeps a dear{fchool, but fools  
will learn in no other,” as Poor  
Richard favs, and f{carce in that ;  
for itis true, * We may give advice,  
bet we cannot give condutt.” How-  
ever, remember this, * They that  
will not be counfelled, cannot be

helped ;”’ and farther, that « If you  
will not hear reafon, fhe will furely  
rap your knuckles,” as Poor Rich-  
ard fays.’  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended  
his harangue. ‘The people heard it,  
and approved the doétrine, and im-  
mediately prattiled the contrary,  
jutt as if it had been a common fer-  
mon ; for the auétion opened, and  
they began to buy extravagantly.  
I found the good man had thorough-  
ly ftudied my Almanacks, and digeft-  
ed all I had dropt on thefe topicks  
during the courfe of 25 years. The  
frequent mention he made of me  
mult have tired any one elfe; but’  
my vanity was wonderfuily delight-

that nota tenth part of the wifdom  
was my own, which he afcribed to  
me ; but rather the gleanings that L  
had made of the fenfe of all ages and  
nations. However, I refolved to  
be the better for the echo of it ; and  
though I had at firft determined to  
buy ftuff for a new coat, 1 went a-  
way, relolved to wear my old one

Judge, then, how much I mutt have  
heen gratified, by an incident l am go-  
ing to relate to you. I ftopped my horie  
lately where a great number of people  
were colleSted at an auétion of mer-  
chants goods,» The hour of the fale  
not being come, they were converfing  
on thé Badnefs of the times: and one  
of the company called :o a plain clean  
old man with whitelocks—* Pray,father  
* Abraham, what think you of the times?  
€ Will not thele heavy taxes quite ruia  
* the couptry ? How {hall we ever be able  
‘ to pay them? What would you advife  
*us to? &quot;Father Abraham ftood up, and  
replied, ¢ +if you would have my ad-  
* vice, I will give it you in fhort, * yal  
‘* a word to the wife is enough,”  
  
* poor Richard fays.&quot; They joined in  
dering him ‘to {peak his mind; and  
gathering round him, he aan as  
follows :  
  
* Friend:,’ fays he,‘ the taxes are  
* indeed very heavy: and if thofe laid  
* on by the government were the oply  
$ ones we had to pay, we might more  
‘eafily difcharge them: but we have  
§ many others, and much more griev-  
‘ous to fome of us. We are taxed  
* twice as much by our idleneis, three  
$ times as much by our pride, and four  
$ times as much by our folly ; and from  
  
* thefe taxes the commiffioners cannot -  
  
* eafe or, deliver us, by allowing an a-  
« batement. However, let us hearkento  
* good adyice,and fomething may be done  
‘for us; ** God helps them that help  
** themfelves,” as poor Richard fays.  
I. * It would be thought a hard go-  
‘ vernment that fhould tax its pepple  
“ one tenth part of their time, to be  
* employed in its fervice: but idlenefs  
* taxes many of us much more: floth,  
* by bringing on difeafes, abfolutely  
¢ fhortens life. —** Sloth, like ruft, con-  
S*fumes fafter than labour wears, while  
  
“ the ufed ‘key is always bright,” co  
poor Richard fays.—** But doft tho.  
*¢ love hife, then do not fquander time,  
*¢ for thatis the ftuff life is made of,”  
as poor Richard fays:—* How much  
* more than i neceflary do we fpend ia  
‘ flcep ? forgetting that ** The fleeping  
“€ fox catches fo poultry, and that the -  
* willbe fleeping enough in the grzve,”  
as poor Richard fays. F  
  
‘¢ If time be of ail things ‘the me  
‘¢ precious, wafting time muft be” as  
* poor Richard fays, ** the greateft pre -  
‘* digahity;” fince, as he élitwhere telis  
‘us, ** Loft time is never found again :  
“ and whet we call time eneugh, al-

« about to put yourfclf under that ty-  
« ranny, when you run indebt for fuch  
«drefs! Your creditor has authority,  
« at his pleafure, to deprive you of your  
« liberty, by confining you in jail for  
‘ life, or by felling you for 2 fervant, if  
‘you fhould not be able to pay him.  
* When you have gotten your bargain,

** creditors have better memories than  
  
** debtors ; creditors are a fuperftitious  
* feét, great obfervers of {et days and  
“times.” The day comes round  
* before you are aware, and the demand  
* is made before you are preparpd to fa-  
‘ tisfy it: or, if you bear your debt in  
* mind, the term, which at firft feemed  
* fo loug, will, as it leflens, appear ex-  
* tremely thort. Time will feem to have  
* added wings to his heels as well as  
€ fhoulders. ‘ Thofe have a fhort lent,  
* who owe money to be paid at Eafter.”&#x27;  
* At prefent, perhaps, you may think  
€ yourfelves in thriving circumftances,

* gance without injury : but  
“© For age and want fave while you

** cafier to build two chimnies, than to

* fays : fo, “ Rather go to bed fupper-  
* lefs, than rife in debt.”  
“© Get what you can, and what you  
get hold : ‘  
** *Tis the ftone that will turn all your  
lead into gold.” ;  
* And when you have gotten the phj-

I uave heard, that nothing gives an author fo great plea-  
fure as to find his works retpectfully quoted by other learn-  
ed authors. This pleafure I have feldoth enjoyed; for  
though I have been, if I may fay it without vanity, an emi-  
nent author (of Almanacks) annually now a full quarter of  
a century, my brother-authors in the fame way (for what  
reafon I know not) have ever been very {parixg in their ap-

me; fo that, did not my writings produce me fome folid  
pudding, the great deficiency of praile would have quite dif-  
couraged me.  
  
I concluded, at length, that the people were the beft  
judges of my merit, for they buy my works ; and befides, in  
my rambles, where I am not perfonally known, I have fre-  
quently heard one or other of my adages repeated, with

of merchants goods. The hour of fale not being come, they  
were converfing on the badnefs of the times ; and one of the  
company called to a plain, clean, old man, with white locks,  
“ Pray, father Abraham, what think you of the times?  
Won&#x27;t thefe heavy taxes quite ruin the country ? How fhall  
we be ever able to pay them ? What wo@fd&#x27;you advife us  
to?” Father Abraham ftood up, and replied,---“ If you&#x27;d  
have my advice, Ill give it you in fhort: “ For a word to  
the wife is enough ; and many words won’t fill a bufhel,”  
as poor Richard fays.” They joined in defiring him to fpeak  
his mind ; and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows:  
  
“‘ Friends, (fays he), and neighbours, the taxes are in-  
deed very heavy ; and if thofe laid on by the government  
were the only ones we had to pay, we might more eafily dif-  
charge them ; but we have many others, and much more  
grievous to fome of us. We are taxed twice as much by  
our idlenefs, three times as much by our pride, and four times  
as much by our folly; and from thefe taxes the commif-  
fioners cannot eafe or deliver us, by allowing an abatement.  
However, let us hearken to good advice, and fomething may  
be done for us; “ God helps them that help themfelves,”  
as poor Richard fays, im his Almanack.  
  
It would be thought a hard government that fhould tax  
its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its  
fervice ; but idlenefs taxes many of us much more, if we  
reckon all that is fpent in abfolute floth or doing of nothing,  
with that which is {pent im idle employments, or amufements  
that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on difeafes, ab-  
folutely thortens life. “ Sloth, like ruft, contumes fafter than  
labour wears, witile the key ufed is always bright,” as  
peor Richard fays. “ But doft thou love life? then do not  
iquander time, for that’s the ftuff life is made of,” as poor  
Richard fays- How much more than is neceflary do we  
{pend im fleep! forgetting that “the fleeping fox catches  
no poultry, and that there will be fleeping enough in the  
grave,” as poor Richard fays. “If time be of all things  
the moft precious, wafting time muft be (as poor Richard  
fays} the greateft prodigality ;” fince, as he elfewhere  
tells, “ Loft time is never found again; and what we call  
time enough, always proves little enough,” Let us then  
up and be doing, and doing to the purpofe ; fo by diligence

fhall we do more with lefs perplexity. ‘“ Sloth makes all  
things difficult, but induftry all eafly,” as poor Richard  
fays ; and, “ he that rifeth late, muft trot all day, and hall  
fearce overtake his bufinefs at night; while lazinefs  
travels fo flowly, that poverty foon overtakes him,” as we  
read in poor Richard; who adds, “ Drive thy bufinefs ; let  
not that drive thee;” and, “ early to bed, and early to  
rife, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wife”  
  
So what fignifies withing and hoping for better times?  
We make thele times better if we beftir ourfelves. “ Induf-  
try need not wiih,” as poor Richard fays; and, “ He that  
lives upon hope, will die fafting.”” “ There are no gains  
without pains; then help hands, for I have no lands; or if I  
have, they are {martly taxed;” and, (as poor Richard like-  
wife obferves), “ He that hath a trade hath an eftate ; and  
he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honour :”  
but then the trade muft be worked at, and the calling well  
followed, or neither the eftate nor the office will enable us  
to pay our taxes. If we are induftrious, we thall never  
ftarve; for, as poor Richard fays, “ At the working-man’s  
houfe hunger looks in, but dares not enter.” Nor will the  
bailiff or the conftable enter; for, “ Induftry pays debts,  
while defpair increafeth them,” fays poor Richard. What  
though you have found no treafure, nor has any rich relation  
left you a legacy? “ Diligence is the mother of good-luck,”’ as  
poor Richard fays; and, “ God giyes all things to induftry;  
then plough deep while fluggards fleep, and you fhall have  
corn to fell and to keep,” fays poor Dick. Work while it is  
called to-day; for you know not how much you may be  
hindered to-morrow; which makes poor Richard fay, “ One  
to-day is worth two to-mosrows;’’ and farther, “ Have you  
fomewhat to do to-morrow, do it to-day.” If you were a  
fervant, would you not be afhamed that a good mafter fhould  
catch you idle : Are you then your own maiter, be afhamed te  
catch yourfelf idle,” as poor Dick fays. When there is fo  
much to be done for yourfelf, your family, your country, and  
your gracious king, be up by peep of day; “ let not thefun look  
down, and fay, inglorious here he lies!” Handle your tools  
without mittens; remember, that “ the cat in gloves catches  
no mice,” as poor Richard fays. It is true, there is much  
to be done, and perhaps you are weak-handed ; but flick to  
  
it fteadily, and you will fee great effets; for, “ conftant

dropping wears away ftones, and, by diligence and patience  
the moufe ate into the cable 5 and, little ftrokes fell great  
oaks,” as poor Richard fays in his Almanack, the year J  
cannot juft now remember.  
  
Methinks I hear fome of you fay, “ muft a man afford  
himfelf no leifure ?”---I will tell thee, my friend, what poor  
Richard fays: “ Employ thy time well, if thou meanef  
to gain leifure; and fince thou art not fure of a minute,  
throw not away an hour.” Leifure is time for doing fome-  
thing ufeful ; this leifure the diligent man will obtain, but  
the lazy man never ; fo that, as poor Richard fays, “ A life  
of leifure, and a life of lazinefs are two things.” Do you  
wmagine that floth will afford you more comfort than labour ?  
No: for, as poor Richard fays, “‘ Troubles {pring from idle-  
nefs, and grievous toil from needlefs eafe: Many without  
labour would live by their wits only ; but they break for  
want of ftock :” Whereas induftry gives comfort, and plen-  
ty, and refpect. “ Fly pleafures, and they&#x27;ll follow you ; the  
diligent {pinner has a large fhift; and, now I have a theep  
and a cow, every body bids me good morrow ;” all which is  
well faid by poor Richard.  
  
But with our induftry, we muft likewife be fteady, fettled,  
and careful, and overfee our own affairs with our own eyes,  
and not truft too much to others ; for, as poor Richard fays,  
  
“TI never faw an oft-removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve fo well as thofe that fettled be.”  
  
And again, “ Three removes is as bad as a fire ;” and  
again, “ Keep thy fhop, and thy thop will keep thee ;” and  
again, “ If you would have your bufinefs done, go; if not,  
fend.” And again,  
  
“ He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himfelf muft either hold or drive.”  
  
And again, “ The eye of a mafter will do more work than  
both his hands ;” and again, “ Want of care does us more  
damage than w ant of knowledge ;” and again, “* Not to over-  
fee workmen, i is to leave them your purfe open.” Trufting  
too much to others care, is the ruin of many : for, as the Al-  
manack fays, “ In the affairs of the world, men are faved not  
by faith, but by the want of it :” but a man’s own care is  
profitable ; for, faith poor Dick, “ Learning is to the ftudi

ous, and riches to the careful, as well as power to the bold,  
and heaven to the virtuous.”” And farther, “ If you would  
have a faithful fervant, and one that you like, ferve your-  
felf.” And again, he advifeth to circumfpeétion and care,  
even in the fmalleft matters, becaufe fometimes “ A little  
neglect may breed great silchief : ;”’ adding, “ For want of  
a nail the fhoe was loft; For want of a thoe the horfe was  
left ; and for want of a horfe the rider was loft ;” being  
overtaken and flain by the enemy ; all for want of care about  
a horfe-fh hoe nail.  
  
So much for induftry, my friends, and attention to one’s  
own bufinefs ; but to thefe we muft add frugality, if we  
would make our induftry more certainly fuccefsful. A man  
may, if he knows not how to fave as he gets, “ keep his nofe  
all his life to the grindftone, and die not worth a groat at  
lait.” “ A fat kitchen makes a lean will,” as poor Rich-  
ard fays ; and,  
  
“ Many eftates are {pent in the getting ;  
Since women for tea, forfook {pinning and knitting,  
And men for punch, forfook hewing and fplitting.”  
  
“ If you would be wealthy, (fays he, in another alma-  
nack), think of faving, as well as of getting: The Indies  
have not made Spain rich, becaufe her out-goes are greater  
than her incomes.”  
  
Away then, with your expenfive follies, and you will not  
have much caufe to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and  
chargeable families ; for, as poor Dick fays,  
  
*» Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth fmall, and the want great.”  
  
And farther, “ What maintains one vice, would bring  
up two children.” You may think, perhaps, that a little  
tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more coft-  
ly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and  
then, can be no great matter; but remember what poor  
Richard fays, “ Many a little makes a meikle; and far-  
ther, “ Beware of little expences ; a fmall leak will  
fink a great fhip;” and again, “ Who dainties love, thall  
beggars prove ; and moreover, “ Fools make feafts, and  
wile men eat them.”

HERE you are all got together at this fale of fineries and  
nicknacks, You call them goods ;: but if you Ag not take  
care, they will prove evils to fome of you... You expe? they  
will be fold cheap, andperhaps they may for lefs than  
they coft ; but if you have no occafion for them they mug  
be dear to you. Remember what poor, Richard days,  
* Buy what thou halt no need of, and ’ere long thou fhalt  
fell thy neceflaries.” And again, “* At a greatpenny-werth  
pauie awhile.” He&#x27;tneans,, that perhaps the cheapnefs is  
apparant only, not real ;.or the bargain, \by,ftraitenin  
  
thee in thy bufinefs, may do thee more harm than good.  
For in another place he fays, ** Many have been ruined by  
buying good pennyworths,”” , Again poor. Richard fays,  
“It is foolifh to lay out money in a purchafe ‘of repen-  
tance ;” and yet this folly is praGifed every day at.ance  
tions, for want of minding the Almanack,, .“¢ Wife men  
(as poor Dick fays) learn fy others harms, fools fcarcely  
by their own; but Felix. quem be coch vate’ ritula cantum.””  
Many a one, for the fake of finery on the back, haye gone  
with a hungry belly, and half farvyed their f molieas  
“ Silk and. fattins, fcarlet and veivets, (at poor Richard  
fays) put out the kitchen fire.” Thefe are not the necef-  
faries of life ; they can frarcely be called the conveniences ;  
and yet only hecaufe ‘icy look pretty, how many want to  
have them? the artificial wants of mankind thus become  
more numerous than the fatival}and;‘as. poor Dick fays,  
** For one poor perfon, tlfere are an hundred indigent.”  
By thefe, and other:extrawagancies, the gentéel dve teduc-

worth miming; “ A child and ‘a fool (as poor Richard  
fays) imagine twenty fhillings and twenty years can neve  
be {pent ;. but always be taking out of the meal-tub, and  
never putting in, foon comes to the bottom 4” then, as  
poor Dick fays, ** When the well is dry, they know the  
worth of water.’’, But this they might have known be-  
fore, if they-had taken’his advice: “ If you would know  
the value of money, go and try to barrow fome; for he  
that goes a botrowing goes a iorrowing ; and, indeed; fo  
does ™ that lends to fuch people, when he goes to get it  
in again.” Poor Dick farther advifes and fays;  
  
«“ Fond pride of drefs is fire a very curte }  
  
E’er fancy you confult, confult your purfe.”  
And again, ‘* Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a  
great. deal more faucy.’”” When you have bought one-fine  
thing, you muft buy ten more, that your appearance may  
be all of a‘piece; but poor Dick fays, “ It is eafiet to fup-  
prefs the firk defire, than to fatisfy all that follow it.”  
And itis’ as ‘truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as  
the frog to fwell, in order to equal the ox.  
  
* Veffels large may venture more,  
  
But little boats fhould: keep near hore.”  
  
Tis, however, a folly foon punifhed ; for “ Pride that  
dines on’ vanity, fups on contempt,” as poor Richard faysy  
And in another place, “ Pride breakfafted with Plenty,  
dined with Poverty, and fupped with Infamy.” And,  
after all, of what ufe is this pride of appearance, for  
which fo much is rifked, fo much is fuffered? It cannot  
promote health, or eafe pains it makes no increafe of merit  
in the perfon ; it creates envy ;~*haftens misfortune  
  
“ What is a butterfly? at &quot;belt  
  
He’s but a catterpillar dreft ;  
  
The gaudy fop’s his pictare jut,”  
as poor Richard fays.  
  
But what madnefs muft it be to run in debt for thefe fu-  
perfluities! We are. offered by the tetms of this fale fir  
months credit ; and that; perhaps, has induced fome of us  
to attend it, becaufe we cannot {pare the ready money, and  
hope now to be fine without it. But, ah! think what  
you do when you run in debt, You give to another power  
over your liberty... If you cannot pay at the time, you  
will be athamed to fee your creditor ; yeu will be ist fear

when you {peak to him; you will make poor, «pitifuly  
{neaking excufes, and by degrees come to lofe your vera+  
city, and fink into bafe downright lying ; for, as. poor  
Richard fays, “‘ The fecond vice is lying; the fir is  
running in debt.” And again, to the fame purpofe,  
“« Lying rides upon debt’s back; whereas a free-born  
Englifhman ought not to be afhamed nor afraid to fee or  
{peak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a  
man of all {fpirit and virtue; “ Is is hard for an empty  
bag to ftand upright,” as poor Richard truly fays. What  
would you think of that prince, orthat government, who  
would iffue an edict, forbidding you to drefs like a gentle-  
man or gentlewoman, on pain of imprifonment or fervi-  
tude ? would you not fay, that you were free, have a right  
to drefs as you pleafe, and that iuch an edict, would be  
a breach of your privileges, and fueh government tyranni-  
cal? And yet you are about to put yourfelf-ander that  
tyranny when you run in debt for fuch drefs ! Your credi-  
tor has authority, at his pleafure, to deprive you of your  
liberty, by confining you in goal for life, or by felling you  
for a fervant, if you flould not be able to pay him. When  
you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little  
of payment: but “ creditors (poor Richard tells us). have  
better memories than debtors ;” and in another place he  
fays, “ Creditors are a fuperititious fe&amp;, great obfervers  
of fet days and times.’? The day comes round before you  
are aware, and the demand is made before you are pre-  
pared to fatisfy it. Or if you bear your debt in mind,  
the term which at firft feemed fo long, will, as it leffens,  
appear extremely fhort. Time will feem to have added  
wings to his heels as well as his fhoulders. ‘“ Thofe have  
a fhort Lent (faith poor Richard,) who owe money. to be  
paid at Eafter.” Tiien fince, as he fays, “ The borrower  
is a flave to the ender, and the debtor to the creditor ;’  
difdain the chain, preferve your freedom, and maintain  
your independeacy: be induftrious and free; be frugak  
and free. At prefent,perhaps, you may think yourfelves  
i thriving circumftances, and that you can bear a little  
extrav ce without injury ; but  
“* For age and want fave while you may,  
No morning fun lafts a whole day,”

tfgt- 149  
  
as poor Richard fays. Gain may be temporary and uncer-  
tain; but ever, while you live, expence is conftant and  
  
‘eettain: and * It is eafier to build two chimneys, than to  
  
keep one in fuel,” as poor Richard fays. So * Rather go  
to bed fupperlefs than rife in debt.”  
  
« Get what you can, and what you get hold;  
  
*Tis the ftone that will turn all your lead into gold,”  
as poor Richard fays. And when you have got the phi-  
lofopher’s ftone, fure you will no longer complain of bad  
times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.  
  
This doétrine, my friends, is reafon and wifdom: But,  
after all, do not depend too much upon your own induf-  
try, and frugality, and prudence, though excellent things ;  
for they may be blafted without the blefling of heaven 3  
and therefore afk that blefling humbly, and be not uncha-  
ritable to thofe that at prefent feem to want it, but com-  
fort and help them. Remember Jub fuffered and was af-  
terwards profperous.  
  
And now, to conclude, “ Experience keeps a dear  
fehool ; but fools will learn in no other, and fcarce in  
that ; for it is true, we may give advice, but we cannot  
give conduct,” as poor Richard fays. However, remem-  
ber this, “* They that will not be counfelled, cannot be  
helped,” as poor Richard fays; and further, “ That if  
you will not hear Reafon fhe will furely rap your nuckles.””  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The  
people heard it, and approved the doétrine, and immedi-  
ately practifed the contrary, juft as if it had been a com-  
mon fermon : for the auction opened, and they began to  
buy extravagantiy, notwithftanding all his cautions, and  
their own fear of taxes. I found the good man had tho,  
roughly ftudied my Almanacks, and digetted all I had  
dropped on thofe topics, during the courfe of twenty-five  
years. The frequent mention fe made of me, muft have  
tired any one elfe ; but my vanity was wonderfully de-  
lighted with it, though | was confcious that not a tenth  
part of the wifdom was my own, which he afcribed to me,  
but rather the gleanings that I have made of the fenfe of  
all ages and nations. However, I refolved to be the bet-  
ter for the echo of it; and tho’ I had firft determined te  
buy ftuff for a new coat, I went away, resolved to wear  
my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the

how much I mutt have been gratified by an

ny called to a plain, clean, old man, with  
white locks, ‘ Pray, Farber Abrabam, what

taxes quite ruin the country? How fhall

vernment were the only ones we had to  
pay, we might more eafily difcharge them ;  
but we have many others, and much more  
grevious to fome of us.——We are taxed  
twice as much by our idlenefs, three times  
as much by our pride, and four times as  
much by our folly; and from thefe taxes  
the commiffioners cannot cafe.or deliver us,

hunger looks in, but dares not enter.’’-———  
‘¢ Nor will the bailiff or the conftable enter,  
for, Induftry pays debts, while defpair en-  
creafeth them.’ What though you have  
found no treafure, nor has any rich relation  
left you a legacy, ** Diligence is the mother  
of good-luck, and God gives all things to  
induftry. Then plow deep, while fluggards  
fleep, and you fhall have corn to fell and to  
keep.”? Work while it is called to-day, for  
you know not how much you may be hin-  
dered to-morrow. ‘* One to-day is worth  
two to-morrows,” . as Poor Richard fays ;  
and farther, Never leave that till to. morrow,  
which you can do to-day.’’—If you were a  
fervant, would you not be afhamed that a  
good mafter fhould catch you idle? Are you  
then your own mafter? Be afhamed to catch  
yourfelf idle, when there is fo much to be  
done for yourfeif, your family, your coun-  
Handle your tools  
without mittens: remember that ** The cat  
in gloves catches no mice,” as Poor Richard  
fays. It is truc, there is much to be done  
  
.and perhaps, you are weak handed ;. but  
  
ftick to it fleadily, and you will fee great  
effects ; for ** Conftant dropping wears away  
ftones; and by diligence and patience the  
moule ate intwo the cable ; and little ftrokes  
fell great oaks.”’  
  
¢ Methinks I hear fome of you fay, ** Muft  
a man afford himfelf no Icifure ?’? I will tell  
thee, my friend, what Poor Richard fays;  
Employ thy time well, if thou meaneft to  
gain iciiure, and, fince thou art not fure of  
a minute, throw not away an hour.” Lei.  
fare is me for doing fomething ufeful ; this  
leifure the diligent man will obtain, but the  
lazy man never; for, ‘* A life of leifurc,  
and a life of lazinels are two things.- Many,

‘‘ He that by the plough would thrivé,

‘ And again, *‘ The eye of a mafter will |  
do more work than both his hands; and ©  
again, ** Want of care does us more das  
mage than want of knowledge ;” and —  
again, ** Not to overfee workmen, is to —  
leave them your purfe open.” ‘ Trufting |  
too much to others care is the ruin of many |  
for, in the affairs of this world, men ire ©

jut a man’s own care is profitable; for, &amp;

And farther, “ What maintains one vice,  
would bring up two children.”” You may  
think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little  
eh now and then, diet a little more coft-  
y, clothes a little finer, and a little epter-  
tainment now and then, can be no great  
‘wuatter; but remember, ‘* Many a little  
makes a mickle.”” Beware of little expen-  
ces; ** A fmall leak will fink a great thip,”  
38 Poor Richard fays; and again, ** Who  
‘daintics love, thall beggars prove ;”” and  
‘moreover, ** Fools make feafts,; and wife  
‘men cat them.”” Here you are all got to-  
gether to this fale of finerics and _nick-  
nacks. You call them goods: but if you  
do not take care, they will prove evils to  
fone of you. You expect they will be  
fold cheap, and, perhaps, they may for lefs  
than they coft ; but if you have no occafion  
  
| for them, they will be dear to you. Re-  
  
member what poor Richard fays, “ Buy  
what thou haft no need of, and ere long  
  
thou thalt fell thy neceflaries.”” And again,  
 *#* At a great pennyworth paufe a while.”  
He means that, perhaps, the cheapnefs is ap-  
  
&#x27; t only, but not real; or the bargain,  
firaitening thee in thy bufinefs, may do  
thee more harm than good. For in another  
  
a pics he fays, ** Many have been ruined by  
  
tiying good pennyworths.” Again, * It  
is foolifh to lay out money in a purchafe of  
repentance ;” and yet. this folly is pradctiled  
every day at auctions, for want of minding  
the almanack. Many a one, for the fake  
of finery on the back, have gone with a  
hungry belly and half Rarved their families ;  
  
&#x27; Silks and fattins, fcarlets and ve!vets, put  
out the kitchen fire,”” as Poor Richard fays.  
  
Thefe are not the neceffaries of life, they  
can fearcely be called the conveniences ; and  
  
yet only becaule they look pretty how many  
  
want to have them? By thele and other  
extravagancies, the genteel are reduced to  
poverty, and forced to borrow of thofe whom  
they formerly defpifed, but who, thro’ in-  
duiiry and frugality, have maintained their  
flanding ; in which cafe it appears plainly,  
that * A plonghman on his legs, is higher  
than a gentleman on his knees,” as Poor  
Richard fays.” ‘Pethaps they have a {mall

never putting in, foon comes to the bottom,”’  
as Poor Richard fays ; and then, ** When  
the well is dry, they know the worth of  
the water.” But this they might have  
known before, if they had taken his advice :  
“¢1f you would know the value of money,  
go and try to borrow fome ; for he that  
zoes a borrowing, goes a forrowing,”’ as  
  
oor Richard fays ; and indeed fo does he  
that lends to fuch people, when he gocs to  
get it in again. Poor Dick farther advifes,  
and fays,  
  
‘© Fond pride of drefs is fure a very curfe ;  
‘© Ere fancy you confult, coniult your  
purfe.”’  
  
And again, “ Pride is as loud a beggar as  
want, and a great deal more faucy.’’ When  
you have bought one fine thing, you mutt  
buy ten more, that your appearance may  
be all of a-piece; but Poor Dick fays,  
‘6 It is eafier to fupprefs the firft defire, than  
to fatisfy all that follow it:”’ And ir is as  
truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as  
for the frog to fwell, in order to equal the  
OX. :  
  
‘© Veflels large may venture more,  
*¢ But little boats fhould keep near fhore.”’  
  
It is, however, a folly foon punifhed: for,  
as Poor Richard fays, ‘ Pride that dines on  
vanity, fups on contempt; Pride breakfafled  
with plenty, dined with poverty, aad fupped  
with infamy.’ After all, of what ule is  
this pride of appearance, for which fo much  
is _rifked, fo much is fuffered? It cannot  
promote health, nor eafe pain ; it makes no  
increafe of merit in the perfon, it creates  
envy, it haftens m¢ fortune.  
  
** But what madnefs muft it be to run in  
debt for thefe tuperfluitics ? We are offered  
by the terms of this fale, fix months credit ;  
and that perhaps has induced fome of us to  
attend it, becaufe we cannot fpare the ready  
moncy, and hope now to be fine without it.  
Bat ah! think what you co when you run  
in debt, you give to another power over  
pour liberty. If you cannot pay at the  
time, you will be afhathed to fee your cre-  
ditor; you will be in fear when you {peak  
to him; and you will make poor pitiful  
{neaking excufes, and by degrees, come to  
lole your veracity, and fink into bafe down-  
right lying; for, ** The /ecord vice is ly-  
ing, the ficit is ronning in debt,”’ as Pgor  
Richard fays; again, to the fame purpofe,  
** Lying rides upon Debt’s back ;”” where-  
as 2 free-born Englifhman ought not to be  
afhamed or afraid to fee or fpeak to any  
man living. But poverty often deprives a  
man of ail {pirit and virtue. -**it is hard  
tor an empty bag to ftand upright.” What

would you think of that prince, or of that  
  
yernment, who fhould iffue an edict for-  
bidding you to drefs-like a gentleman or  
gentlewoman, on pain of imprifonment, or  
fervitude? Would you not fay that you  
were free, have a right to drefs as you  
pleafe, and that fuch an edict would be a  
breach of your privileges, and fuch a go-  
vernment tyrannical? And yet you are  
about to put yourlelf under that tyranny,  
when you run in debt for fuch drets! Your  
creditor has authority, at his pleafure, to de-  
  
rive you of om liberty, by confining you  
in gaol for lite, or by felling you for a ter-  
vant, if you fhould not be able to pay him.  
When you have got your bargain, you may,  
perhaps, think little of payment; but, as  
  
| Poor Richard fays, ‘* Creditors have better  
  
memories than debtors; creditors are a  
fuperftitious feat, great obfervers of fet days  
and times.”’» The day ‘comes round belore  
you are aware, and the demand ts made be-

Time will feem to  
  
‘¢ Thole have a fhort lent, who  
owe money to be paid at Eafter.”” At pre-  
  
§ fent, perhaps, you may think yourfelves in  
  
thriving circumftances, and that you can  
bear a little extravagance without injury, but  
  
‘© For age and want fave while you may,  
‘¢ No morning-fun lafts a whole day.”  
  
| © Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but  
  
ever while you live, expenie is conflant and  
  
and, ** It is eafier to build two  
*¢ chimneys, than to keep one in fuel,” as  
  
| Poor Richard fays: fo ** Rather go to bed  
&amp; * fupperlefs than rife in debt. ””  
  
‘* Get what you can, and what you get  
fill hold, [lead into gold ”’  
‘* *Tis the ftone that willturn all your  
  
BS &lt; And when you have got the philofopher’®  
f ftone, fure you will no longer complain o  
  
bad times, or the difficulty of paying  
  
; taxes.’  
  
IV. © This doctrine, my friends, is rea-  
  
| fon and wifdom. But, after all, do net de-  
; pend too much upon your own indultry and  
» frugality, and prudence, though excellent  
| things; for they may all be blafied, with-  
  
out the blefling of Heaven ; and therefore,  
  
| afk that bleffing humbly, and be not un  
| charitable to thofe that at prefent feem to  
  
want it, but comfort and help them. Re-  
  
member Job fufflered, and was afterwards  
| prolperous.  
  
‘ And, now to conclude, ** Experience  
keeps a dear fchool, but fools will Jearn-in

no other,” ‘ as Poor Richard fays, and  
fearce in that; for, it is true, ** We m  
give advice, but -we cannot give condudt y  
However, remember this, ** They that will  
not be counlelled, cannot be helped ;”&quot; and  
fariher, that ** if you will not hear Reafon,  
fhe will furely rap your knuckles,’’ as Poor  
Richard fays,  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his hae  
rangue. The people heard it, and approved  
the doctrine—and immediately practifed the  
contrary, juft as if it had been a common  
fermon; for the auction opened, and they  
began to buy extravagantly—I found the  
good man had thoroughly ftudied my Alma-  
nacks, and digefted all 1 had dropt on thefe  
topics during the courfe of twerity five  
years. The frequent mention he made of  
me muft have tired any one elle; but my  
vanity was wonderfully delighted with it,  
though I was conftious, that not a’ tenth .  
part of the wifdom was my own, which he  
atcribed to me; but rather the gleanings  
that I had made of the {en‘e of all ages-and  
nations. However, 1 relolved to be the  
better for the echo of it; and, thoughl  
had at firlt determined to buy ftuff for a  
new coat, | went away ‘refolved to wear  
my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou  
wilt do the fame, thy profit will be ag  
great as mine.—I am, as ever,  
  
Thine to ferve thee,

poverty foon overtakes him. Drive  
thy bufinefs, let not that drive thee;

yakes a man healthy, wealthy, and  
wile,” as Poor Richard fays.  
  
‘ So what fignifies withing and  
hoping for better times; we may  
make thefe times better, if we beftir  
ourfelves. ‘ Induftry need not with,  
and he that lives upon hope will die  
fafting. ‘There are no gains without  
pains; then help hands, for I have  
no lands, or, if I have, they are  
{martly taxed. He that hath a trade,  
hath an eftate; and he that hath a  
calling, hath an office of profit and  
honour,” as Poor Richard fays; but  
‘then the trade muft be worked at, and  
the calling well followed, or neither  
the eftate nor the office will enable us  
to pay our taxes; for, ‘at the work-  
ing-man’s houfe hunger looks in, but  
dares not enter.” Nor will the bailiff  
or the conftable enter; for, ‘‘ Induftry  
pays debts, while defpair increatet  
them.” What though you have

One to-day is worth two to-mor-

farther, “‘ Never leave that tiil to-

not be afhamed that a good siailer

for, “In the affairs of this world,

the want of it:” but a man’s own care  
is profitable; for “ Lf you would have

you are all got together to this fale  
of fineries and nick-nacks. You call

the cheapnefs is apparent only, and  
not real; or the bargain, by ftraiten-  
ing thee in thy bufinefs, may do thee  
more harm than good. For in ano-  
ther place | he fays, “* Many have been  
ruined by buying good renry-worths.”  
Again, “ It is foolifh to fay out mo-  
ney in a purchafe of repertance ;”  
and yet this fo’ ly is prattifed every  
day at auctions, for want of minding  
the : Almanack. Many a one, for the  
alte of finery on the back, have gone  
wi th a hungry belly, and half ftarved  
their famihes. « Silks and fattins,

‘Thefe are not the neceffaries of hic;

and then, “ When the well is dry,

this they might have known bofore,  
if they had taken his advice: * if  
you would know the value of money,  
go and try to borrow fome ; for he  
that goes a borrowine, goes a forrow-

Poor Dick tartner advifes and fays,  
  
Fond pride of drefs is fure a very curfs;  
Ere fancy you coniult, confult your purte.  
  
«And again, * Pride is as loud a  
beggar as want, and a great deal

one fine thing, you mut buy ten  
moe, that your appearance may be  
all of a piece; but Poor Dick fays,  
“ ]t is eafier to fuppreis the firit de-

Gain may be temporary and uncer-  
tain, but ever while you live, ex-  
pence is conitant and certain ; and,  
«It is eafier to build two chimnies,  
than to keep one in fuel,” as Poor  
Richard fays; fo “* Rather go to bed  
fupperlefs, than rife in debt.”  
  
Get what youcan, and what you get hold,  
*Tis the ftone that will turn all your lead

do not depend too much upon your

ak that blefling humbly, and be not  
uncharitable to thofe that at prefent

was afterward profperous.  
  
« And, now to conclude, “ Experi-  
ence keeps a dear fchool, but fools  
will learn in no other,” as Poor  
Richard fays, and fcarce in that ; for,  
it is tuc, ‘ We may give advice, but  
we cannot give conduct.” However,  
remember tals, « They that will not

and farther, that, “If you will not  
hear yeafon, fhe will furely rap your  
knuckles,”’ as Poor Richard fays.’  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his  
sarangue. ‘The people heard it, and  
approved the doétrine—and immedi-  
azcly practiied the contrary, juft as if  
ut had been a common {ermon ; for

I will give it to you in short, “ for a word to the wise

him, he proceeded as follows :  
  
‘ Friends,’ says he ‘ the taxes are indeed, very hea-

IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wis-  
dom ; but, after all, do not depend too much upo  
your own industry, and frugality, and prudence  
though excellent things: for they maybe blasted,  
without the blessing of heaven; and therefore ask  
that blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to those  
that at present seem to want it. but comfort and help  
them. Remember Job suffered and was afterwards  
prosperous.  
  
* And now, to conclude, “ experience keeps a dear  
school, but fools will learn in no other,” as poor  
Richard says, and scarce in that; for it is true“ we  
may give advice, but we cannot give conduct:”  
however, remember this, “ they that will not be  
jcounselled cannot be helped ;” and farther, that “ if  
you will not hear reason, she will surely rap your  
knuckies,” as poor Richard says.’  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The  
people heard it, and approved the dectrine ; and im-  
mediately practised the contrary, just as if it had  
been a common sermon, for the auction «pened and  
they began to buy extravagantly. I found the good.  
man had thoroughly studied my almanacs. and di-  
gested all I had dropt on those topics during the  
course of twenty-five years ‘The frequent mention  
he made of me must have tired any one else ; but  
my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, h  
1 was conscious, that not a tenth part of the wisdom  
was my own, which he ascribed to me, but rather  
the gieanings that I had made of the sense of all ages  
and nations. However, I resolved to be the better  
  
  
  
If youlfor the echo of it; and, though I had at first deter-

ware of little expenses ; “a small leak will sink a  
at ship,” as Richard says; and again, “ who  
ainties love, shall beggars prove ;” moreover.  
“ fools make feasts, and wise men eat them ”  
  
‘ Here you areall got together to this sale of fine |  
  
rowing goes a sorrewing,” as poor Richard says ;  
  
and indeed so does he that lends to such people,  
world, men are saved, not by faith, but by the want}hen he goes to get it again. Poor Dick further  
  
dvises, and says,  
  
“ Fond pride of dress is sure a curse,  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse,”’.  
  
And again, “ pride is as loud a beggar as want, and  
a great deal more saucy.” When you have bought  
jone fine thing, you must buy ten more, that your ap-  
pearance may be all of a piece ; but poor Dick says,  
“ it is easier to suppress the first desire than to sa-  
tisfy all that follow it ;” and it is as truly folly for  
the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to swell in  
order to equal the ox.  
  
* Vessels large may venture more,  
  
But little beats should kee p near shore.”  
  
It is, however, a folly soon punished ; for, as poo.  
Richard says. “ pride that dines on vanity, sups on  
contempt; pride breakfasted with plenty. dined

il, what use is this pride of appearance, for  
which so much is risked, so much suffered ? It can-  
ot promote health, nor ease pain: it makes no in-  
rease of merit in the person; it creates envy, it

thou meanest to gain leisure ; and since thou are not says, * many have been ruined by buying  
  
sure of a minute, throw not away an hour.’ Leisure  
is time for doing something useful; this leisure the  
diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never ;  
for “a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two  
things. Many, without labour, would live by their  
wits only, but they break for want of stock ;” where-  
as industry gives comfort, and plenty, and respect  
“Fly pleasures, and they will follow you. The dili-  
t spinner has a large shift; and now I have a  
  
pet and a cow, every one bids me good-morrow.”  
  
’ it But with our industry we must likewise be  
steady, settled and careful, and oversee our own af  
fairs with our own eyes, and not trust too much to  
others ; for, as poor Richard says,  
  
“ T-never saw an oft-removed tree,  
  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
  
That throve so well as those that settled be ”  
  
  
  
penny-  
worths.” Again, “it is foolish to lay out money in  
a purchase of repentance ;” and yet this folly is  
practised every day at auctions, for want of minding  
the almanac. Many a one, for the sake of finery  
on the back, have gone with a hungry belly, and  
half starved their families; “ silks and satins, scar-  
let and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,” as poor&#x27;  
Richard says. -‘Vhese are not the necessaries of  
‘ife, they can scarcely be called the conveniences ;  
and yet, only because they look pretty, how many  
want tohave them? By these and other extrava-  
gancies, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and  
forced to borrow of those whom they formerly des-  
  
maintained their standing ; in which case it a

Judge, men, hew much I must have  
bveii gratified by an incident I am going-  
to relate to you. I stopped my horse  
lately, where agieat number of people  
were collccicd, at an auction of mer-  
chant’s goods. T).e hour of the sale not  
being coiik, they were conversing on  
the badness of the linn s ; and one of the  
comp-sny called to a plain clean old man,  
■with white locks. ‘Pi-ay h&#x27;athcr Abraham  
What think you of tiiu ti:u s ? W^iil noi  
these heavy tr-sts niiiic ruin the coun-  
try ? How shall we evter be able to pay&quot;  
them ? What would you advise us to do:’  
Father Abraham stood up, and replied.  
‘ If you would have my advise, I will gi-. c  
it to you in short, “ lor a word to ilu-  
wise is enough,” as Poor Richard says.’  
They joined in des ring him to speak lus  
mind, and gathering round him, he pro  
cceded as follows :  
  
‘ Friends,’ says he, ‘the taxes are in-  
deed, very heavy, and, if those laid on by  
the government were tlie only ones we  
bad to pay, we might more easily dis-  
charge tjiein ; but we have many others,  
and much more grievous to some of us.  
W care taxed twice as much by our idle-  
ness, three limes as much by our pride,  
and four times as much by our folly ;  
and from these taxes the commissioners  
cannot ease or deliver us, by allowing an  
abatement, tlowever, let us hearken to  
good advice, and something may be doi&#x27;.c  
for us; “tiou hcips them that helps them-  
selves,” as poor Richard says.  
  
‘I. It would be thoU-;ht a har-.l gov  
ernmi&#x27;iif that should tax its peopie one  
tenth part of their time, to be employed  
in its service ; but idleness taxes many  
of us much more ; sloth, by bringing on  
diseases, abundantly shortens life. “Sloth,  
like rust, consumes faster than labor  
wears, while the used key is always  
briglit, as poor Richard says “ Hut  
dost thou love life, then do nut squander  
time, for that is the stuff life is ni.tde of,”  
as poor Riciiard says. How much more  
than is necessary do we spend in sleep ?  
forgetting, that “ the sleeping fox catch-  
es no poultry, and that there will be  
sleeping enough in the grave,” us poor  
Richard says.  
  
“ If time be of all things the most  
precious, wasting time must be,” as pom-  
Richard says, “the greatest protligaiity;”  
since, as lie elsewhere tells us, “ lost  
time is never found again ; and what wc  
call time enough always proves little  
enough let us then up and be doing,  
and doing to the purpose ; so by dili-  
gence shall we do more with less per-  
plexity. “ Sloth makes all things diffi-  
cult, but indi:stry all easy ; and he that  
riseth late, must trot ali day, and shall  
scarce overtake his business at night :  
while laziness travels so slowly, that pov-  
erty soon overtakes him. Drive thy  
business, let that not drive thee ; and  
early to bed and early to rise, makes a  
man healthy, wealthy and wise,” as poor  
Richard says

century, my brother-authors in the same way  
(for what reason I know not) have ever been very  
sparing in their applauses; and no other author  
has taken the least notice of me; so that, did not  
my writings produce mesome solid pudding, the  
great deficiency of praise would have quite dis-  
couraged me.  
  
I concluded at length, that the people were the |;  
best judges of my merit, for they buy my works;  
and besides, in my rambles, where I am not per-  
sonally known, I have frequently heard one or  
other of my adages repeated, with “‘ As poor  
Richard says” at the end on’t. This gave me  
some satisfaction; as it showed not only that my  
instructions were regarded, but discovered like-  
wise some respect for my authority: and I own,  
that, to encourage the practice of remembring  
and repeating those wise sentences, I have some-  
  
—  
  
Judge then how much I have been gratified by  
an incident [am going torelateto you. Istopped  
my horse lately where a great number of people  
were collected at an auction of merchants’ goods.  
The hotr of sale not being come, they were con-  
versing on the badness of the times; and one of  
the company called to a plain, clean, old man, with  
white locks, ** Pray, father Abraham, what think  
  
you of the times? Won&#x27;t these heavy taxes quite  
ruin the country? How shall we be ever able to  
pay them? What would you advise us to do?”  
  
Father Abraham stood up, and replied,—“ If you’d  
have my advice, I’ll give it you in short: ‘Fora  
word to the wise is enough; and any words won’t  
filla bushel,’ as poor Richard says.”” They joined  
in desiring him to speak his mind; and gathering  
round him, he proceeded as follows;  
*‘ Friends, (says he), and neighbours, the taxes :  
are indeed very heavy; and if those laid on by  
the government were the only ones we had to pay,  
we might more easily discharge them; but we  
have many others, and much more grevious to  
some of us. Weare taxed twice as much byour  
idleness, three times as much by our pride, and |  
four times as much by our folly; and from these  
taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver  
us, by allowing an abatement. However, let me  
hearken to good advice, and something may be  
  
  
  
  
  
done for us; ‘“*God helps them that help them-  
selves,’ as poor Richard says, in his Almanac.  
It would be thought a hard government that  
should tax its people one-tenth part of their time,  
to be employed in its service; but idleness taxes  
many of us much more, if we reckon all that is  
spent in absolute sloth or doing of nothing, with  
that which is spent in idle employments, or amuse-  
ments that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bring-  
ing on diseases, absolutely shortens life. “Sloth,  
like rust, consumes faster than labour wears;  
while the key used is always bright,” as poor j  
Richard jsays. ‘ But dost thou love life! then  
do not squander time, for that’s the stuff life is  
made of,” as poor Richard says. How much more  
than is necessary do we spend in sleep! forgetting  
that “the sleeping fox catches no poultry, and  
that there will be sleeping enough in the grave,”  
as poor Richard says. ‘If time be of all things  
the most precious, wasting time must be (as poor  
Richard says) the greatest prodigality;” since, as  
he elsewhere tells, ‘‘ Lost time is never found  
again; and what we call time enough, always’  
proves little enough,” Let.usthen up and be do-  
ing, and doing to the purpose; so by diligence  
shall we do more with less perplexity. ‘Sloth  
makes all things difficult, but industry all easy,”  
as poor Richard says; and, ‘‘ he that riseth late,  
must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake his  
  
——=  
  
=  
  
  
  
  
  
buisiness at night; while laziness travels so slow-  
  
in poor Richard; who adds, “ Drive thy buisiness;  
  
ly, that poverty soon overtakes him,” as we read  
  
let not that drive thee;” and, “early to bed, and  
early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and  
wise.”  
  
So what signifies wishing and hoping for bet-  
ter times? We make these times better if we  
bestir ourselves. ‘* Industry need not wish,” as  
poor Richard says; and, “ He that lives on hope,  
will die fasting.” ‘There are no gains without  
pains; then help hands, for I have no lands; or if  
I have, they are smartly taxed;” and, (as poor  
Richard likewise observes), “‘ He that hath a  
trade hath an estate; and he that hath a calling  
hath an office of profit and honour:” but then the  
trade must be worked at, and the calling well fol-  
lowed, or neither the estate nor the office will en-  
able us to pay our taxes. If weare industrious,  
we shall never starve; for, as pooor Richard says,  
“At the working-man’s hovse hunger looks in,  
but dares not enter.” Nor will the bailiff or the  
constable enter; for,‘‘ Industry pays debts, while  
despair increaseth them,” says poor Richard.  
What though you have found no treasure, nor  
has any rich relation left you a legacy? “ Dili-  
gence is the mother of good luck,” as poor Rich-  
ard says; and, “‘ God gives all things to industry;  
then plough deep while sluggards sleep, and you  
shall have corn to sell and to keep,” says poor  
Dick. Work while it is called to-day; for you  
know not how much you may be hindered to-mor-  
row; which makes poor Richard say, ** One to-  
day is worth two to-morrows;” and farther,  
, Have you somewhat to do to-morrow, do it to

‘If you were a servant, would you not be

there isso much to he done for yourself, your

Methinks I hear some of you say, “ must a man  
afford himself no leisure?”—I will tell thee, my  
friend, what poor Richard says: * Employ thy  
time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure; and  
since thou art not sure of a minute, throw not  
away anhour.” Leisure is time for doing some-  
thing useful; this leisure the diligent man. will  
obtain, but the lazy man never; so that, as poor  
Richard.says,.“‘ A life of leisure, and a life of Ja-  
ziness, are two things.” Do you imagine that  
sloth will afford you more comfort than labour?  
No: for, as poor Richard says, “‘ Troubles spring  
from idleness, and grievous toil front needless  
ease: Many without labour would live by their  
wits only; but they break for want of stock:”  
whereas industry gives comfort, and plenty, and  
respect. ** Fly pleasures, and they&#x27;ll follow you,  
the diligent spinner has a large gown; and, now I  
have a sheep and a cow, every body bids me good  
morrow;” all which is well said by poor Richard.  
  
But with, our industry we must likewise be  
steady, settled, and careful, and oversee our own  
affairs with our own eyes,_and not trust too much  
to others; for, as poor Richard says,  
  
J] never saw an oft-removed tree,  
  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve as well as those that settled be.”  
  
And again, * Three removes are as bad asa  
fire; and again, ‘“ Keep thy shop, and thy shop  
will keep thee;” and again, “If you would have

your buisiness done, go; if not, send.” And again,  
«He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.”  
  
And again, “ The eye of a master will do more  
work than both his hands,” and again, ‘* Want  
of care does us more damage than want of know-  
ledge;” and again, ‘‘ Not to oversee workmen, is  
to leave them your purse open.” Trusting too  
much to others’ care, is the ruin of many: for,  
as the Almanac says, ‘In the affairs of the  
world, men are saved not by faith, but by the  
want of it.” But a man’s own care is profitable;  
for, saith poor Dick, ‘“‘ Learning is to the studious,  
and riches to the careful, as well as power to the  
bold, and heaven to the virtuous.” And farther,  
“Tf you would have a faithful servant, and one  
that you like, serve yourself.” And again, he ad-  
viseth to circumspection and care, even in the  
smallest matters, because sometimes ‘* A little  
neglect may breed great mischief;” adding, ‘*For  
want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of a  
shoe the horse was lost, and for want of a horse  
the rider was lost;” being overtaken and slain by  
the enemy; all for want of a little care about a  
horse-shoe nail.  
  
So much for industry, my friends, and attention  
to one’s own business; but to these we must add  
frugality, if we would make our industry more  
certainly successful. A man may, if he knows  
not how to save as he gets, “‘ keep his nose ail  
his life to the grind-stone, and die not worth a  
groat at last.

I wave heard, that nothing gives an author so great pleasure,  
as to fiad his works respectfully quoted by others. Judge,  
then, how much I must have been gratified by an incident I[  
am going to relate to you. I stopped my horse lately, where a  
great number of people were collected, at an auction of mer-  
chants’ goods. ‘The hour of the sale not being come, they  
were conversing on the badness of the times; and one of the  
company called to a plain, clean, old man, with white locks,  
Pray, Father Abraham, what think you of the times? Will  
not these heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How shall we  
ever ro able to pay them? What would you advise us to? —  
Father Abraham stood up, and re plied, If you would have my  
advice, I will give it to you in short, ‘‘ for a word to the wise  
is enough, -as Poor Richard says. ‘They joined in desiring  
him to speak his mind, and ga thering round him, he proceeded  
as follows.  
  
Friends, says he, the taxes are indeed very heavy, and if  
those laid on by the government were the only ones we had to  
pay, we might more easily discharge them ; but we have many  
others, and much more grievous to some ofus. We are t taxed  
twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by our  
pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from these  
taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us, by allow-  
ing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice,  
arid something may be done for us; ‘God helps them that  
help themselves,” as Poor Richard says.  
  
I. It would be thought a hard government, that should tax  
its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its  
service; but idleness taxes many of us much more; sloth, by  
bringing on diseases, absolutely shortens life. ‘‘ Sloth, like  
rust, consumes faster than labor wears, while the used key is  
always bright,” as poor Richard says. ‘‘ But doest thou love  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
116 Poor Richard Revived.  
  
life, then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made  
of,” as poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary  
do we spend in sleep! forgetting, that “‘ the sleeping fox catch-  
es no poultry, and that there will be sleeping enough in the  
grave,” as poor Richard says.  
  
‘“‘ If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time  
must be,” as poor Richard says, ‘‘the greatest prodigality ;”  
since, as he elsewhere tells us, ‘‘ lost time is never found again;  
and what we call time enough, always proves little enough ;”  
let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpose ; so by  
diligence shall we do more, with less perplexity. ‘* Sloth  
makes all things difficult, but industry all easy; and he that  
riseth late, must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake his  
business at night ; while laziness travels so slowly, that poverty  
soon overtakes him. Drive thy business, let not that drive  
thee; and early to bed, and early torise, makes a man healthy,  
wealthy, and wise,” as poor Richard says.  
  
So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times? We  
may make these times better, if we bestir ourselves. ‘‘ Industry  
need not wish, and he that lives upon hope will die fasting.  
There are no gains without pains; then help hands, for I have  
no lands,” or if I have, they are smartly taxed. ‘‘ He that  
hath a trade, hath an estate; and he that hath a calling, hath  
an office of profit and honor,” as poor Richard says ; but then  
the trade must be worked at, and the calling well followed or  
neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes.  
If we are industrious, we shall never starve; for, ‘‘at the  
working man’s house, hunger looks in, but dares not enter.”  
Nor will the bailiff or the constable enter, for ‘‘ industry pays  
debts, while despair increaseth them.” What though you  
have found no treasure, nor has any rich relation left you a  
legacy, ‘‘diligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives  
ali things to industry. Then plough deep, while sluggards  
sleep, and you shall have corn to sell and to keep.” Work  
while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may  
be hindered to-morrow. ‘‘ One to-day is worth two to-mor-  
rows,” as poor Richard says; and farther, “‘ never leave that  
till to-morrow, which you can do to-day.” If you were a  
servant, would you not be ashamed that a good master should  
catch you idle? Are you then your own master? Be ashamed  
to catch yourself idle, when there is so much to be done for  
yourself, your family, your country, and your king. Handle  
your tools without mittens ; remember, that “‘ the cat in gloves  
catches no mice,’”’ as poor Richard says. It is true, there is  
  
  
  
Poor Richard Revived. 117  
  
much to be done, and perhaps you are weak-handed ; but  
stick to it steadily, and you will see great effects, for ‘‘ con-  
stant dropping wears away stones; and by diligence and  
patience the mouse ate in two the cable; and little strokes fell  
great oaks.”  
  
Methinks I hear some of you say, ‘‘ must a man afford him-  
self no leisure?”’ I will tell thee, my friend, what poor Rich-  
ard says; ‘employ thy time well, if thou meanest to gain  
leisure , and since thou art not sure of a minute, throw not  
away an hour.” Leisure is time for doing something useful ;  
this leisure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man  
never; for ‘‘a life of Icisure and.a life of laziness are two  
things. Many, without labor, would live by their wits only,  
but they break for want of stock ;” whereas industry gives  
comfort, and plenty, and respect.  
  
II. But with our industry we must likewise be steady, set-  
tled, and careful, and oversee our own affairs with our own  
eyes, and not trust too much to others; for, as poor Richard  
says,  
  
‘J never saw an oft-removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.”  
  
And again, “three removes is as bad as a fire; ” and again,  
  
“keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee;” and again,  
“if you would have your business done, go, if not, send.” And  
again,  
‘* He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself must either held or drive.”  
  
And again, ‘‘ the eye of a master will do more work than both  
his hands ;” and again, “‘ want of care does us more damage  
than want of knowledge;” and again, ‘‘ not to oversee work-

to others’ care is the ruin of many; for, ‘ in the affairs of this

may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, ‘‘ keep his nose  
all his life to the grindstone, and die not worth a groat at last.  
A fat kitchen makes a lean will;’’ and  
  
‘¢ Many estates are spent in the getting,  
  
Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,  
And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.”  
  
‘Tf you would be wealthy, think of saving, as well as of get-  
ting. ‘The Indies have not made Spain rich, because her out-  
goes are greater than her incomes.”  
  
Away, then, with your expensive follies, and you will not  
then have so much cause to complain of hard times, heavy taxes,  
and chargeable families ; for  
  
“ Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth small, and the want great.”  
  
And farther, ‘‘ what maintains one vice, would bring up two  
children.” You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little  
punch now and then, diet a little more costly, clothes a little  
finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great  
matter ; but remember, ‘‘ many a liitle makes a mickle.” Be-  
ware of little expenses; “‘ a small leak will sink a great ship,”  
as poor Richard says; and again, ‘“‘ who dainties love, shall  
beggars prove ;” and moreover, “ fools make feasts, and wise  
men eat them.”  
  
Here you are all got together to this sale of fineries and nick-  
nacks. You call them goods, but if you do not take care, they  
will prove evils to some of you. You expect they will be sold  
cheap, and perhaps they may, for less than they cost; but if  
you have’ no occasion for them, they must be dear to you. Re-  
member what poor Richard says, ‘‘ buy what thou hast no need  
of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.” And again,  
‘‘at a great penny-worth pause a while.” He means, that  
perhaps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real; or the  
bargain, by straitening thee in thy business, may do thee more  
harm than good. For in another place he says, ‘‘ many have  
been ruined by buying good penny-worths.”’ Again, ‘it is  
foolish to ny out money ina purchase of repentance;” and  
yet this folly is practised every day at auctions, for want of  
minding the almanac. Many a one for the sake of finery on  
the back, have gone with a hungry belly, and half starved their  
families; ‘‘ silks and satins, scarlet and velvets put out the  
kitchen fire,’ as poor Richard says. These are not the neces-  
saries of life, they can scarcely be called the conveniences;  
and yet, only because they look pretty, how many want to have  
them? By these and other extravagancies, the genteel are

reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they  
formerly despised, but who, through industry and frugality,  
have maintained their standing ; in which case it appears plain-  
ly, that ‘* a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman  
on his knees,” as poor Richard says. Perhaps they have had  
a small estate left them, which they knew not the getting of ;  
they think “‘ it is day, and it will never be night; ” that a little  
to be spent out of so much is not worth minding ; but ‘ always  
taking out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, soon comes  
to the bottom,” as poor Richard says; and then, ‘‘ when the  
well is dry, they know the worth of water.” But this they  
might have known before, if they had taken his advice; “if  
you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow  
some ; for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing,” as poor  
Richard says ; and indeed so does he ‘that lends to such peo-  
ple, when he goes to get it again. Poor Dick farther advises,  
and says,  
“ Fond pride of dress is sure a curse ;  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.”  
  
And again, ‘‘pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a great  
deal more saucy.’? When you have bought one fine thing, you  
must buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of a piece;  
but poor Dick says, “‘ it is easier to suppress the first desire  
than to satisfy all that follow it;” and it is as truly folly for  
the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to swell in order to  
equal the ox.  
“ Vessels large may venture more,  
But little boats should keep near shore.”’

says, ‘‘ pride that dines on vanity, sups on contempt; pride  
breakfasted with plenty, dined with poverty, and supped with  
infamy.’ And, after all, of what use is this pride of appear-  
ance, for which so much is risked, so much is suffered? It  
cannot promote health, nor ease pain; it makes no increase of  
merit in the person; it creates envy, it hastens misfortune.  
  
But what madness must it be to run in debt for these super-  
fluities! We are offered, by the terms of this sale, six months’  
credit; and that perhaps has induced some of us to attend it,  
because we cannot spare the ready money, and hope now to be  
fine without it. But ah! think what you do when you run in  
debt ; you give to another power over your liberty. If you  
cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see your cred-  
itor ; you will be in fear when you speak to him, when you will

lose your veracity, and sink into base, downright lying; for,  
** the second vice is lying; the first is running in debt,” as  
poor Richard says; and again to the same purpose, “ lying  
rides upon debt’s back ;” whereas a free-born Englishman  
ought not to be ashamed nor afraid to see or speak to any man  
living. But poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and vir-  
tue. ‘It is hard for an empty bag to stand upright.’””, What  
would you think of that prince, or of that government, who  
should issue an edict forbidding you to dress like a gentle-  
man or gentlewoman, on pain of imprisonment or servitude ?  
Would you not say, that you were free. have a right to dress as  
you please, and that such an edict would be a breach of your  
privileges, and such a government tyrannical? And yet you  
are about to put yourself under that tyranny, when you run in  
debt for such dress! your creditor has authority, at his pleas-  
ure, to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in gaol for  
life, or by selling you for a servant, if you should not be able  
to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, per-  
haps, think little of payment; but, as poor Richard says,  
‘* creditors have better memories than debtors; creditors are  
a superstitious sect, great observers of set days and times.”  
The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand  
is made before you are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bear  
your debt in mind, the term, which at first seemed so long  
will, as it lessens, appear extremely short; time will seem to  
have added wings to his heels as well as his shoulders.  
*‘Those have a short Lent, who owe money to be paid at  
Easter.” At present, perhaps, you may think yourselves in  
thriving circumstances, and that you can bear a little extrava-  
gance without injury ; but  
“‘ For age and want save while you may,  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.”  
Gain may be tempor:ry and uncertain, but ever, while you  
live, expense is constant and certain; and, “it is easier to  
build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel,” as poor Richard  
says ; so, ‘‘rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt.”  
“ Get what you can, and what you get hold;  
&quot;T is the stone that will turn all your lead into gold.”  
  
And when you have got the philosopher’s stone, sure you will  
no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty of paying  
taxes.

after all, do not depend too much upon your own industry, and  
frugality, and prudence, though excellent things; for they may

all be blasted, without the blessing of Heaven; and therefore  
ask that blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to those that  
at present seem to want it, but comfort and help them. Re-  
member Job saffered, and was afterwards prosperous.  
  
And now, to conclude, ‘‘ experience keeps a dear school, but  
fools will learn in no other,” as poor Richard says, and scarce  
in that ; for, it is true, ‘‘ we may give advice, but we cannot  
give conduct ;”’ however, remember this; “‘ they that will not  
be counselled, cannot be helped ;” and farther, that ‘ if you  
will not hear reason, she will surely rap your knuckles,” as  
poor Richard says.  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people  
heard it, and approved the doctrine ; and immediately practised  
the contrary, just as if it had been a common sermon, for the  
auction opened, and they began to buy extravagantly. — I found  
the good man had thoroughly studied my almanacs, and digest-  
ed all that I had dropt on those topics during the course of  
twenty-five years. ‘The frequent mention he made of me must  
have tired any one else; but my vanity was wonderfully de-  
lighted with it, though I was conscious, that not a tenth part of  
the wisdom was my own, which he ascribed&#x27;to me, but rather  
the gleanings that I had made of the sense of all ages and na-  
tions. However, I resolved to be the better for the echo of it;  
and, though, I had at first determined to buy stuff for a new coat,  
I went away, resolved to wear my old one a little longer. Read-  
er, if thou wilt do the same, thy profit will be as great as mine.

But with our industry we must likewise  
be steady, settled and careful, and oversee  
our own affairs with our own eyes, and not  
trust too much to others; for, as Poor  
Richard says,  
  
**T never saw an oft-remove] tree,  
  
Nor yet an olt-removed family,  
  
That thrives so well as those that settled be.”  
And again “three removes is as bad as a  
fire;” and again, ‘keep thy shop, and thy  
shop will keep thee;” and again, “tif you  
would have your business done, go, if not,  
send.” And again,  
  
“He that by the plough woul: thrive,  
  
Himself most either hold or drive.’  
  
And again, ‘the eye of a master will do  
more work than both his hands;”’ and  
again, “ want of care does more damage  
than want of knoWledge;” and again, “not  
to oversee workmen, is to leave them your  
purse open.” ‘Trusting too much to eth-  
ers’ care is the ruin of many: for, ‘‘in the  
affairs of this world, men are saved, not  
by faith, but by the want it;”’ but a man’s  
ewn care is profitable; for ‘if you would  
have a faithful servant, and one that you  
like, serve yourself. A little neglect may  
breed great mischief; for want of a nail  
the shoe was lost, and for want of a shoe  
the horse was lost, and for want of a horse  
the rider was lost,” being overtaken and  
slain by the enemy; all for want of a little  
care about a horse-shoe nail.  
  
So&#x27;much for industry, my friends, and  
attention to one’s own business; but to  
these we must add frugality, if we would  
make our industry more certainly success-  
ful. A man may, if he knows not how to  
save as he gets, “‘keep his nose all his life  
te the grindstone, and die not worth a groat  
at last. &lt;A fat kitchen makes a lean will;”  
and  
  
o estates in the getting,  
  
oon a Beton bocdieghs oo nae og knitting,  
  
Aad men for puach forsook hewing anJ splitting.”  
“If you would be weathy, think of saving,  
as well as of getting. The Indies Lave  
not made Spain rich, because her outgoes  
  
wre greaier than ber incomes.”

Away, then, wit  
and you will not then have so much cause  
to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and  
chargeable families; for  
  
*« Women an! wine, game an | deceit, -  
Make the wealth small, aal the want great.  
And farther, “‘ what maintains one vice,  
would bring up two children.” You may  
think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little  
punch now and then, diet a little more cost-  
ly, clothes a little finer, and a little enter-  
tainment now and then, can be no great  
matter; but remember, “many a little  
makes a mickle.”” Beware of little ex-  
penses; “a small leak will sink a great  
ship,’ as Poor Richard says; and again,  
“who dainties love, shall beggars prove,”  
and moreover, “fools make feasts, and wise  
  
men eat them.”  
  
Here you are all got together to this  
sale of fineries and nicknacks. You call  
them goods, but if you du not take care,  
they will prove evi s to some of you. You  
expect they will be sold cheap, and per-  
haps they may for less than they cost; but  
if vou have no occasion for them, they  
must be dear to you. Remember what  
Poor Richard says, ‘buy what thou hast  
no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy  
necessaries.”’ And again, “at a great  
penny-worth pause awhile.” He means,  
that perhaps the cheapness is apparent on-  
ly, and not real; or the bargain, by strait-  
ening thee in thy business, may do thee  
more harm than good, For in another  
place he says ‘‘many have been ruined by  
buying good penny-worths.” Again, “it  
is tuolish to lay out money in a purchase  
of repentance;”’ and yet this folly is prac-  
ticed every day at auctions, for want of  
minding the Almanac. Many a one for  
the sake of finery on the back, have gone  
with a hungry belly, and half starved their  
families; ‘silks and satins, scarlet and vel-  
vets, pul out the kitchen fire,’’ as Poor  
Richard says. These are not the neces-  
saries of lite, they can scarcely be called  
the conveniences; and yet, only because  
they look pretty, how many want to have  
them? By these and other extravagan-  
cies, the genteel are reduced to poverty,  
and ferced to borrow of those whom they  
formerly despised, but who, through indus-  
try and frugality, have maintained their  
standing, in which case it appears plainly,  
that “a ploughman on his legs ts higher  
than a gentleman on his knees,” as Poor  
Richard says. Perhaps they have a small  
estate left them, which they know not the  
getting of; they think ‘it is day, and it will  
never be night;” that a little to be spent  
out of so much is not worth minding; but  
‘always taking out of the meal tub, and  
never putting in, soon comes to the bot-  
tom,” as Poor Richard says; and then,  
‘‘when the well is dry, they know the worth  
of water.” But this they might have  
known before, if they had taken his ad-  
vice; “if you would know the value of mo-  
ney go and borrow some; for he that goes  
a borrowing goes a sorrowing,” as Poor  
Richard says; and indeed so does he that  
lends to such people, when he goes to get  
it again, Poor Dick farther advises and  
says,  
  
‘* Fond pride of dress is sure a curse;  
  
ire fancy you .onsult, consult your purse;”’  
And again, * pride is as loud a beggar as  
want, and a great deal more saucy.’’—  
When you have bought one fine thing, you  
must buy ten more, that your appearance  
may be all ofa piece; but poor Dick says  
“it is easier to suppress the first desire,  
than to satisfy all that follow it,” and itis  
as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich,  
us for the frog to swel! in order to equal

as Poor Richard says, * pride that dines  
on vanity, sups on contempi; pride break-  
fasted with plenty, dined with poverty, and  
supped with imfamy.”’  
what use is this pride, of appearance, for  
which so much is risked, so much is suf-  
fered? It cannot promote health, nor ease  
pain; it makes no increase of merit in the  
person; it creates envy, it hastens misfor-  
tune.  
  
Bout what madness must it be to run in  
debt for these superfluities! We afe offer-  
ed, by the terms of this sale, six months  
credit; and that pehaps has induced some  
of us to attend it, because we cannot spare  
  
| the ready money, and hope now to be fine  
  
without it. But ah! think what you do  
when you run in debt; you give to another  
power over your own liberty. If you can-  
not pay at the time, you will be ashamed  
to see your creditor; you will be in fear  
when you speak to him, when you will  
make poor, pitiful, sneaking excuses, and  
by degrees come to lose your veracity,  
and sink into base, downright lying; for  
“the second vice is lying; the first is run-  
ning in debt,” as Poor Richard says; and  
again to the same purpose, “lying rides  
upon debt’s back,” ‘whereas a free-born  
Englishman ought not to be ashamed nor  
afraid to see or speak to any man living.  
But poverty often deprives a man of all  
spirit and virtue. “ Itis hard for an eifip-  
ty bag to stand upright.” What would  
you think of that prince, or of that gov-  
ernment, who should issue an edict forbid-  
ding you to dress like a gentleman or gen-  
tlewoman, on pain of imprisonment or ser-  
vitude? Would vou not say that you were  
frec, have a right to dress as vou please,  
and that such an edict would be a breech  
of your privileges, and such a government  
tyrannical? And yet you are about to put  
yourself under that tyranny, when you run  
in debt for such dress! your creditor has  
authority at his pleasure, to deprive you  
of your liberty, by confining you in gaol  
for life, or by selling vou for a servant, if  
you should not be ableto pay him. When  
you have got your bargain, you may, per-  
haps, think little of payment; but, as Poor  
  
h your expensive fullies, |  
  
And, after all, of  
  
  
  
Richard says, “creditors have better mem- |  
ories than debtors; creditors are a super- |  
stitious sect, great observers of set days |  
and times. ‘The day comes round before  
you are aware, and the demand is mace |  
before you are prepared to satisfy it; or, |  
if you bear your debt in mind, the term,  
which at first seemed so long, will, as it |  
lessens, appear extremely short; time will |  
seem to have added wings to his heels as  
well as his shoulders. ‘“ Those have a  
short Lent, whe owe money to be puid at  
Easter.”” At present, perhaps, you may  
think yourselves in thriving circumstances,  
and that you can bear a little extravagance  
without injury; but  
  
* For age aw! want save whi&#x27;e you may,  
  
No morning sun lasts a whole day;”  
  
Gain may be temporary and uncertain but  
ever while you live, expense 13 constant  
and certain; and, “it is easier to build two  
chimneys than to keep one in fuel,” as  
Poor Richard says; sv, “rather go to bed  
supperless than rise in debt.”  
  
“ Get what you can, and what you get hold;  
  
&quot;Tis the stove that will turn all your lead into goll;”’  
And when you have got the philosopher’s  
stone, sure you will no longer complain of  
bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.  
  
This doctrine, my friends, is reason and  
wisdom; but, after all, do not depend too  
much upon your own industy, and frugali-  
ty, and prudence, thuugh excellent things;  
for they may all be blasted, without the  
blessing of Heaven; and therefore ask that  
blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable  
to those that at present seem to want it,  
but comfort and help them. Remember  
Job suffered, and was afterwards prosper-  
ous.  
  
And now, to conclude, ‘ experience  
keeps a dear schools, but fools will learn  
in no other,” as Poor Richard says, and  
scarce in that; fer, it is true, “ we may  
wive advice, but we cannot give conduct ;”  
however, remember this; ‘‘they that will  
not be counselled, cannot be helped;”’ and  
farther, that “if you will not hear reason,  
she will surely rap your knuckles,” as  
Poor Richard says,  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his har-  
ague. The people heard it, and approv-  
ed the doctrine; and immediately practis-  
ed the contrary, just as if it had beena  
common sermon, for the auction opened,  
and they began-to buy extravagantly. I  
found the good man had thoroughly stud-  
ied my almanacs, and digested all that I  
had dropt on those topics during the course  
of twenty five years. The frequent men-  
tion he made of me must have tired any  
one else; but my vanity was wonderlvlly  
delighted with it, though I was courscious,  
that not a tenth part of the wisdom was  
my own, which he ascribed to me, but  
rather the gleanings that I made of the  
sense of all ages and nations. Llowever,  
I resolved to be the better for the echo o”  
it; and, though, I had at first determined  
to buy stuff tor a mew coat, I went away,  
resolved to wear me old one a little longer.  
Reader, if thou wilt do the same, thy profit  
will be as great as mine.

I nave heard, that nothing gives an author so great plea-  
sure as to find his works respectfully quoted by other learned  
authors. This pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for though  
T have been, if r may say it without vanity, an eminent au-  
thor (of Almanacks) annually now a full quarter of a century,  
my brother authors in the saine way (for what reason I know  
not) have ever been very sparing in their applauses ; and no  
other author has taken the least notice of me: so that, did  
not my writings produce me some solid pudding, the great  
deficiency of re would have quite discuuraged me.  
  
I concluded, at length, that the people were the best judges  
of 7 merit, for they buy my works ; and, besides, in my  
rambles, where I am not personally known, I have frequent-  
— one or other of my adages repeated, with ‘As poor  
  
ard says,’ at the end on’t, This gave me some satisfac-  
13*  
  
  
  
tion, as it showed not only that my instructions were regard-  
ed, but discovered likewise some respect for my authority ;  
and I own, that to encourage the practice of reniemberi  
  
reading those wise sentences, 1 — sometimes quoted my-  
self with great gravity, wor}  
  
Judge then how much I have been gratified by an incident  
which I am going to relate to you. I —— my horse lately  
where a great number of people were collected at an auction  
of merchant’s goods. The hour of sale not being come, they  
were conversing on the badness of the times; and one of  
the company called to a plain, clean. old man, with white  
locks, ‘ Pray, father Abraham, what think you of the umes ?  
Won’t these heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How shall  
we be ever ableto pay them? What would you advise us to?  
Father Abraham stood up, and replied,— ‘ If you’d have my  
advice, Pll give it to you in short ; “ for a word to the wise is  
enough ; and many words won’t fill a bushel,” as poor Rich-  
ard says,’ They joined in desiring him to speak his mind ;  
and, gathering round him, he proceeded as follows :  
  
‘Friends (says he) and neighbors, the taxes are indeed  
very heavy ; and if those laid on by the government were the  
only ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge  
them ; but we have many others, and much more grievous to  
some of us, We are taxed twice as much by our idleness,  
three times as much by our pride, and four umes as much by  
our folly ; and from these taxes the commissioners cannot  
ease or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let  
us hearken to good advice, and something may be done for  
us; “ God helps them that help themselves,” as poor Richard  
says in his Almanack. .  
  
‘It would be thought a hard government that should tax its  
people one-tenth part of their time, to be employed in its ser-  
vice ; but idleness taxes many of us much more, if we reckon  
all that is spent in absolute sloth, or doing of nothing, with that  
which is spent in idle employ , oF that  
amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on diseases, abso-  
lutely shortens life. Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than  
labor wears, while the «ey, often used, is always bright,” as  
poor Richard says. ‘ But dost thou love life? then do not  
squander time, for that’s the stuff life is made of,” as poor  
Richard says, How much more than is necessary do we spend  
in sleep! forgetting, that “the sleeping fox catches no poultry,  
and that there wili be sleeping eno R in the grave,” as poor  
Richard says. “If time be of all things the most precious,  
wasting time must be (as poor Richard says) the greatest  
prodigality ;” since, as he elsewhere tells us, ‘‘ Lost time is  
never found again; and what we call time enough always  
proves little enough.” Let us then up and be doing, and do-  
ing to the purpose : so by diligence shall we domore with less  
perplexity. “ Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry all  
easy,” as poor Richard says ; and, “he that riseth late must  
trot all day, and shall scarce overtake his business at night ;  
while laziness travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes  
him,” as we read in poor Richard; who adds, “ Drive thy  
business, let not that drive thee ;” and, “ early to bed, and early  
to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”  
  
‘So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times?  
We make these times better if we bestir ourselves, ‘ Indus-  
try needs not wish,” as poor Richard says; and, “ He that  
lives upon hope will die fasting.” “ There are no gains with-  
out pains ; then help hands, for I have no lands ; or if I have,  
they are yoy ! taxed ;” and (as poor Richard likewise ob-  
serves), “ He that hath a trade hath an estate, and he that  
hath a calling hath an office of profit and honor ;” but then  
the trade must be worked at, and the calling well followed, or  
neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes.  
Ifwe are industrious we shall never starve ; for, as poor Rich-  
ard says, “ At the working man’s house hunger looks in, but  
dares not enter.” Nor will the bailiff or the constable enter ;  
for “ Industry pays debts, but despair increaseth them,” says  
oy Richard. What though you have found no treasure, nor  
  
nas any rich relation left you a legacy? “ Diligence is the  
mother of good luck,” as poor Richard says ; and “ God gives  
all things to industry ; then plough deep while sluggards sleep,  
and you will have corn to sell and to keep,” says poor Dick.  
Work while it is called to-day; for you know not how much  
you may be hindered to-morrow ; which makes poor Richard  
say, “One to-day is worth two to-morrows,” and farther,  
“ Have you somewhat to do to-morrow, do it to-day.” “If  
you were a servant, would you not be ashamed that a gooa  
master should catch you idle? Are you then your own mas-  
ter, be ashamed to catch yourself idle,” as poor Dick says.  
When there is so much to be done for yourself, your family,  
and your Dasa king, be up by peep of day ; “ Let not the  
sun look down, and say, Inglorious have he lies !” Handle  
your tools without mittens ; remember, “ that the cat in gloves  
catches no mice,” as poor Richard says, It is true, there is  
much to be done, and perhaps you are weak-handed ; but stick  
to it steadily, and you will see great effects ; for, “ continual  
dropping wears away stones, and by diligence and patience  
the mouse ate into the cable ; and light strokes fell great oaks,”  
as poor Richard says im his Almanack, the year I cannot just  
now remember.  
  
‘Methinks I hear some of you say, “ Must a man afford  
himself no leisure ?”—I will tell thee, my friend, what poor  
Richard says: “Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to  
gain leisure; and since des art not sure of a minute, throw  
not away an hour.” Leisure is time for doing something use-  
ful: this leisure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man  
never ; so that, as poor Richard says, “ A life of leisure and  
a life of laziness are twothings.” Do you imagine that sloth  
will afford you more comfort than labor? No; for, as poor  
Richard says, “‘ Troubles spring from idleness, and grievous  
toils from needless ease : many without labor w live by  
their own wits only; but they break for want of stock.  
Whereas industry gives comfort, and plenty, and respect.  
F&#x27;ly pleasures, and they’l! follow you ; the diligent spinner has  
  
  
  
  
  
a large shift; and, now I have a sheep and a cow, every body  
bids me good morrow ;” all which is well said by poor  
Richard, woes  
  
‘ But with our industry, we must likewise be steady, and set-  
tled, and careful, and oversee our own affairs with our own eyes,  
and not trust too much to others ; for, as poor Richard says,  
  
**T never saw an oft-removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
Thai throve so well as one that settled be.”  
  
‘And again, “Three removes are as bad as a fire 2” and  
again, “ Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee ;” and  
again, “ If you would have your business done, go; if not,  
send.” And again,  
  
‘* He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.”  
  
And again, “ The eye of the master will do more work than  
both his hands ;” and again, “ Want of care does us more  
damage than want of knowledge ;” and again, ‘ Not to over-  
see workmen is to leave them your purse open.” Tustin  
too much to other’s care is the ruin of many : for, as the A  
manack says, “ In the affairs of the world,men are saved not  
by faith, but by the want of it;” but a man’s own care is pro-  
fitable ; for, saith poor Dick, “ Learning is to the studious, and  
riches to the careful, as well as power to the bold, and heaven  
to the virtuous.” And, farther, “If you would have a fruit-  
ful servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.” And  
again, he adviseth to circumspection and care, even in the  
smallest matters, because sometimes, “ A little neglect may  
breed great mischief ;” adding, “ For want of a aad the shoe  
was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; and for  
want of a horse the rider was lost ;” being overtaken and  
slain by the enemy, all for want of care about a horse-shoe  
nail.  
  
‘So much for industry, my friends, and attention to one’s  
own business ; but to these we must add fugality, if we would  
make our industry more certainly successful. A man may,  
if he knows not how to save as he gets, “ keep his nose all  
his life to the grindstone, and die not worth a groat at last.’”  
“A fat kitchen makes a lean will,” as poor Richard says ;  
  
4 Many estates are spent in the getting ;  
Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,  
And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.”  
  
* If you would be wealthy (says he, in another Almanack),  
think of saving as well as of getting: the Indians have not  
made Spain rich, because her out-goes are greater than her  
incomes.”  
  
‘ Away then with your expensive follies, and you will not  
have much cause to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and  
chargeable families ; for, as poor Dick says,  
  
“Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth small, and the want great.”  
  
‘ And, farther, “ What maintains one vice, would bring up  
two children.” You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or  
a little punch now and then, diet a little more costly, clothes  
a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be  
no great matter; but remember what pe Richard says,  
“ a a little makes a meikle ;” and farther, “ Beware of  
little expenses ; a small leak will sink a great ship ;” and again,  
“ Who dainties love, shall beggars prove ;” and, moreover,  
« Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.”  
  
‘Here you are all got together at this sale of fineries and  
nicknacks. You call them goods ; but if you do not take care,  
they will prove evils to some of you. You expect they will  
be sold cheap, and perhaps they may for less than they cost:  
but if you have no occasion for them, they must be dear to  
  
‘ou. Remember what poor Richard says, “ Buy what thou  
  
ast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.”  
And again, “ At a great pennyworth pause a while.” He  
means, that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only, or not  
real ; or the bargam, by straitening thee m thy business, may  
do thee more harm than good. For in another place he says;  
“ Many have been ruined by buy i pennyworths.’  
Again, as poor Richard says, “ It is foolish to lay out money  
in a purchase of repentance ;” and yet this folly is practised  
every day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanack.  
“ Wise men (as Dick says) learn by others’ harms, fools  
scarcely by their own; but Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula  
cautum.” Many a one, for the sake of finery on the back,  
have gone with a hungry belly, and half starved their fami-  
lies: “ Silk and satins, scarlet and velvets (as poor Richard  
says), put out the kitchen fire.” These are not the necessa-  
ries of life, they can scarcely be called the conveniences ; and  
yet only because they look pretty, how many want to have  
them? The artificial wants of mankind thus become more  
numerous than the natural; and, as

‘* Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse ;  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.”  
And again, “ Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great  
deal more saucy.” When you have bought one fine thing,  
you must buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of  
a piece; but poor Dick says, “It is easier to suppress the  
first desire, than to satisfy all that follow it.” And it is as  
iruly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as the frog te swell in  
order te equal the ox.  
*¢ Vessels large may venture more,  
But little boats should keep near shore.”  
  
’Tis, however, a folly soon punished ; for, “Pride that dines  
on vanity, sups on contempt,” as poor Richard says. And,  
in another place, “ Pride breakfasted with Plenty, dined with  
Poverty, and supped with Infamy.” And, after all, of what  
use is this pride of appearance, for which so much is risked,  
so much is suffered? [t cannot promote health, or ease pain,  
it makes no increase of merit in the person; it creates envy ;  
it hastens misfortunes,  
  
** What is a butterfly? at best,  
  
He’s but a caterpillar drest ;  
  
The gaudy fop’s his picture just,”  
as poor Richard says.  
  
‘ But what madness must it be to run in debt for these su-  
periluities! We are offered by the terms of this sale six  
months’ credit; and that perhaps has induced some of us to  
attend it, because we cannot spare the ready money, and hope  
now to be fine without it, But, ah! think what you do when  
you run in debt. You give to another power over your liber-  
iy. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to  
see your creditor: you will be in fear when you speak to him ;  
you will make poor, pitiful, sneaking excuses, and by degrees  
come to lose your veracity, and sink into base downright ly-  
ing; for, as poor Richard says, “the second vice is lying ;  
the first is running in debt.” And again, to the same pur-  
pose, “ Lying rides upon debt’s back ;” whereas a free-born  
Englishman ought not to be ashamed nor afraid to speak to  
any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all spi-  
rit and virtue: “Tt is hard for en empty bag to stand u  
right,” as poor Richard truly says. What’ would you think  
of that prince, or that government, who would issue an edict,  
forbidding you to dress like a gentleman or a gentlewoman,  
on pain of imprisonment or servitude? Would you not say,  
that you were free, have a right to dress as you please, and  
that such an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and  
such a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to  
put yourself under that tyranny when you run in debt for such  
: Your creditor has authority, at his pieasure, to de-  
  
dress!  
prive you of your liberty, by confining you in jail for life, or  
by selling you for a servant, if you should not be able to pay  
him. When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps,  
think little of payment ; but “ Creditors (poor Richard tells  
us) have better memories than debtors ;” and in another place  
he says, “ Creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers  
of set days and times,” The day comes round before you  
are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared  
to satisfy it. Or if you bear your debt in mind, the term which  
at first seemed so long, will, as it lessens, appear extremely  
short. Time will seem to have added wings to his heels as  
well as at his shoulders. .“ Those have a short Lent (saith  
poor Richard) who owe money to be paid at Easter.” Then  
since, as he says, “ The borrower is a slave to the lender,  
and the debtor to the creditor ;” disdain the chain, preserve  
your freedom, and maintain your independency: be indus-  
trious and free; be frugal and free. At present, perhaps,  
you may think yourselves in thriving circumstances, and that  
you can bear a little extravagance without injury; but  
‘For age and want save while you may,  
No morning sun lasts a whole day,”  
  
as poor Richard says. Gain may be temporary and uncer-  
tain; but ever, while you live, expense is constant and cer-  
tain: and ‘‘it is easier to build two chimneys, than to keep  
one in fuel,” as poor Richard says. So “Rather go to bed  
supperless than rise in debt.”  
  
‘- Get what you can, and what you get hold,  
  
*Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold,”  
as poor Richard says. And when you have got the philoso-  
pher’s stone, sure you will no longer complain of bad times,  
on the difficulty of paying taxes.  
  
“This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom ; but, af=  
ter all, do not depend too much upon your own industry, and  
frugality, and prudence, though excellent things ; for they may  
be blasted without the blessing of Heaven: and therefore ask  
that blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to those that at  
— seem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remem-  
  
er Job suffered, and was afterward prosperous.  
  
‘ And now, to conclude, “ Experience keeps a dear school ;  
but fools will learn in no other, and scarce in that; for it 1s  
true, we may give advice, but we cannot give conduct,” as  
poor Richard says. However, remember this, “They that  
will not be counselled, cannot be helped,” as poor Richard  
says; and, farther, that “If you will not hear Reason, she  
will surely rap your knuckles.”  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue, The people  
heard it, and approved the doctrine, and immediately prac-  
tised the contrary, just as if it had been a common sermon;  
for the auction opened, and they began to buy extravagantly,  
notwithstanding all his cautions, and their own fear of taxes,  
I found the man had thoroughly studied my Almanacks,  
and digested all I had dropped on those topics, during the  
course of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made  
of me, must have tired every one else: but my vanity was  
wonderfully delighted with it, though I was conscious that not  
a tenth part of the wisdom was my own, which he ascribed  
to me, but rather the gleanings that I had made of the sense  
  
  
  
of all ages and nations. However, I resolved to be the bet-  
ter for the echo of it; and though I had first determined to  
buy stuff’ for a new coat, 1 went away, resolved to wear my  
old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the same,  
thy proiit will be as great as mine.

* Methinks I hear some of you say,  
&quot; must a man afford himself no leisure ?&quot; I  
will tell thee, my friend, what poor Richard  
says; &quot; employ thy time well, if thou meanest  
to gain leisure; and since thou art not  
sure of a minute, throw not away an hour.&quot;  
Leisure is time for doing something useful;  
this leisure the diligent man will obtain, but  
the lazy man never; for &quot;a life of leisure  
and a life of laziness are two things. Many,  
without labor, would Jive by their wits  
only, but they break for want of stock  
whereas industry gives comfort, and plenty,  
and respect. &quot; Fly pleasures, and they will  
follow you. The diligent spinner lias a  
large shift; and now I have a sheep and a  
  
cow, every one bids me good-morrow.&quot;  
&#x27;H. But with our industry we must likewise.be  
steady, settled, and careful, and oversee  
our own affairs with our own eyes, and  
not trust too much to others; for, us pour  
Richard says,  
&quot; I never saw nu oft-removed tree,  
In or yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve as well as those settled be.&quot;  
And again, &quot; three removes is as bad as a  
fire;&quot; and again &quot;keep thv shop, and thy  
shop will keep thee;&quot; and again,&quot;if you  
would have your business done, go, if not,  
send.&quot; And again,  
&quot; lie that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.&quot;  
And&#x27; again, &quot; the eye of a master will do  
more work than botli his hands;&quot; and again

Courteous Reaper,—I have heard, that nothing  
gives an author so great pleasure, as to find his works  
respectfully quoted by others. Judge, then, how much  
I must have been gratified by an incident I am going to  
relate to yon. Istopped my horse lately, where a great  
number of people were collected, at an auction of mer-  
chants goods. The hour of the sale not being come,  
they were conversing on the badness of the times; and  
one of the company called to a plainclean old man, with  
white locks, ‘Pray, Father Abraham, what think you  
of the times ? Will not these heavy taxes quite ruin the  
country? How shall we ever be able to pay them ? What  
would you advise us to?’—Father Abraham stood up,  
and replied, ‘If you would have my advice, I will give  
it to you in short, “for a word to the wise is enough,”  
as Poor Richard says.’ They joined in desiring him to  
speak his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded  
as follows:  
  
‘Friends,’ says he, ‘ the taxes are, indeed, very heavy  
and, if those laid on by the government were the only  
ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge  
them; but we have many others, and much more grie-  
vous to some of us. We are taxed twice as much by  
our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four  
times as much by our folly; and from these taxes the  
commissioners cannot ease or deliver us, by allowing an  
abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice,  
and something may be done for us; “God helps them  
that help themselves,” as poor Richard says.  
  
‘I. It would be thought a hard government that should  
tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be employ-  
ed in its service: but idleness taxes many of us much  
more; sloth, by bringing on diseases, absolutely shor-  
tens life. “Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than la-  
bor wears, while the used key is always bright,” as  
poor Richard says. “ But dost thou love life, then do  
not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of,” as  
poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary  
do we spend insleep! forgetting, that “the sleeping fox  
catches no poultry, and that there will be sleeping  
enough in the grave,” as poor Richard says.  
  
‘“Tf time be of all things the most precious, wasting  
time must be,” as poor Richard says, “ the greatest pro-  
digality ;” since, as he elsewhere tells us, “lost time is  
never found again; and what we call time enough al-  
ways proves little enough ;” let us then up and be do-  
ing, and doing to the purpose ; so by diligence shall we  
do more with less perplexity. ‘Sloth makes all things  
difficult, but industry all easy; and he that riseth late,  
must trotall day, and shall scarce overtake his business  
at night; while laziness travels so slowly, that poverty  
soon overtakes him. Drive thy business, let not that  
drive thee; and early to bed, early torise, makes a man  
healthy, wealthy, and wise,” as poor Richard says

‘So what signifies wishing and hoping for better  
times? We may make these times better, if we bestir  
ourselves. “Industry need not wish, and he that lives  
upon hope will die fasting. There are no gains with-  
out pains; then help hands, for I have no lands,” or, if  
I have, they are smartly taxed. “He, that hatha trade,  
hath an estate ; and, he that hath a calling, hath an office  
of profitand honor,” as poor Richard says ; but then the  
trade must be worked at, and the calling well followed,  
or neither the estate nor the office will enable to us pay  
our taxes. If we are industrious, we shall never starve ;  
for, “at the working man’s house, hunger looks in, but  
dares not enter.” Nor will the bailiff or the constable  
enter, for “industry pays debts, while despair in-  
creaseth them.” What though you have found no trea-  
sure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, “ dili-  
gence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all  
things to industry. Then plough deep, while sluggards  
sleep, and you shall have corn to sell and to keep.”—  
Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how  
much you may be hindered to-morrow. “ One to-day is  
worth two to-morrows,” as poor Richard says ; and far-  
ther, “never leave that till to-morrow, which you can  
do to-day.” If you were a servant, would you not be  
ashamed that a good master should catch you idle? Are  
you then your own master? Be ashamed to catch your-  
self idle, when there is so much to be done for yourself,  
your family, yourcountry, and yourking. Handle your  
tools without mittens; remember, that “the cat in  
gloves catches no mice,” as poor Richard says. It is  
true, there is much to be done, and perhaps you are  
weak-handed; but stick to it steadily, and you will see  
great effects, for “ constant dropping wears away stones ;  
and by diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the  
cable; and little strokes fell great oaks.”  
  
‘ Methinks I hear some of you say, “ must a man af-  
ford himself no leisure?” I will tell thee, my friend,  
what poor Richard says; “employ thy time well, if  
thou meanest to gain leisure; and since thou are not  
sure of a minute, throw not away an hour.” Leisure  
is time for doing some thing useful ; this leisure the dili-  
gent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for “a  
life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things.—  
Many, without labor, would live by their wits only, but  
they break for want of stock ;” whereas industry gives  
comfort, and plenty, and respect. ‘“ Fly pleasures, and  
they will follow you. The diligent spinner has a large  
shift; and now I have a sheep and a cow, every one  
bids me good-morrow.”  
  
‘II. But with our industry we must likewise be stea-  
dy, settled, and careful, and oversee our own affairs  
with our own eyes, and not trust too much to others;  
for, as poor Richard says,  
  
‘*T never saw an oft-removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.”  
  
And again, “three removes is as bad as a fire;” and  
again, “keep thy shop, and thy shep will keep thee ;”  
and again, “ if you would have your business done, go, if  
not, send.” And again,  
‘He that by the plongh wonld thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.”  
  
And again, “the eye of a master will do more work  
than both his hands ;” and again, “ want of care does us  
more damage than wantof knowledge and ;” again, “ not  
to oversee workmen, is to leave them your purse open.”  
Trusting too much to other’s care is the ruin of many;  
for, “ in the affairs of this world, men are saved, not by  
faith, but by the want of it;” but a man’s own care is  
profitable; for, “if you would have a faithful servant,  
and one that you like, serve yourself. A little neglect  
may breed great mischief; for want of a nail the shoe  
was lost, and for want of a shoe the horse was lost, and  
for want of a horse the rider was lost,” being overtaken  
and slain by the enemy; all for want of a little care  
about a horse-shoe nail.  
  
‘III. So much for industry, my friends, and attention  
to one’s own business; but to these we must add fru-  
gality, if we would make our industry more certainly  
successful. A man may, if he knows not how to save  
as he gets, “ keep his nose all his life to the grindstone,  
and die not worth agroat at last. A fat kitchen makes  
a lean will;” and  
  
‘* Many estates are spent in the getting,  
  
Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,  
  
And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.”  
“Tf you would be wealthy, think of saving, as well as  
of getting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, be-  
cause her outgoes are greater than her incomes.”  
  
‘ Away then, with your expensive follies, and you will  
not then have so much cause to complain of hard times,  
heavy taxes, and chargable families; for,  
  
*¢ Women and wine, game and deceit,  
  
Make the wealth rand and the want great.”’  
And farther, “ what maintains one vice, would bring up  
two children.” You may think, perhaps, that a little  
tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more  
costly, clothes a little finer, and a little entertainment  
now and then, can be no great matter; but remember,  
“many a little makes a mickle.” Beware of little ex-  
penses ; “a small leak wiH sink a great ship,” as poor  
Richard says; and again, “ who dainties love, shall beg-  
gars prove ;” and moreover, “fools make feasts, and wise  
men eat them.”  
  
‘Here you are all got together to this sale of fineries  
and nick-nacks. You call them goods, but if you do not  
take care, they will prove evils to some of you. You  
expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may, for  
  
less than they cost; but, if you have no occasion for  
  
  
  
them, they must be dear to you. Remember what poor  
Richard says, “ buy what thou hast no need of, and ere  
long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.” And again, “ata  
great penny-worth pause a while.” He means, that per-  
haps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real ; or the  
bargain, by straitening thee in thy business, may do thee  
more harm than good. For in another place he says,  
“ many have been ruined by buying good penny-worths.”  
Again, “it is foolish to lay out money in a purchase of  
repentance ;” and yet this folly is practised a at  
auctions, for want of minding the almanac. Many a  
one, for the sake of finery on the back, have gone with  
a hungry belly, and half starved their families ; “silks  
and satins, scarlet and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,”  
as poor Richard says. These are not the necessaries of  
life, they can scarcely be called the conveniencies ; and  
yet, only because they look pretty, how many want to  
have them? By these and other extravagancies, the  
genteel are re:juced to poverty, and ferced to borrow of  
those whom they formerly despised, but who, through  
industry and fiugality, have maintained their standing ;  
in which case it appears plainly, that “a ploughman  
on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees,” as  
poor Richard says. Perhaps they have had a small es-  
tate left them, which they knew not the get&#x27;ing of; they  
think “it is day, and it will never be night; that a Iit-  
tle to be spent out of so much is not worth minding ; but  
always taking out of the meal-tub, and never putting in  
soon comes to the bottom,” as poor Richard says; and  
then, “when the well is dry, they know the worth of  
water.” But this they might have known before, if they  
had taken his advice; “if you would know the value of  
money go and try to borrow some; for he that goes a  
borrowing goes a sorrowing,”’ as poor Richard says;  
and indeed so does he that lends to such people, when  
he goes to get itagain. Poor Dick farther advises, and  
says,  
  
‘‘Fond pride of dress, is sure a curse,  
  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.”  
And again, “pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a  
great dea! more saucy.” When you have bought one  
fine thing, you must buy ten more, that your appear-  
ance may be all of a piece; but poor Dick says, “it is  
easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that  
follow it;” and itis as truly folly for the poor to ape the  
rich, as for the frog to swell in order to equal the ox.  
  
‘* Vessels large may venture more,  
  
But litle boats should keep near shore.”  
It is, however, a folly soon punished ; for, as poor Rich-  
ard says, “ pride that dines on vanity, sups on contempt;  
pride breakfasted with plenty, dined with poverty, and  
supped with infamy.” And, after all, of what use is  
this pride of appearance, for which so much is risked,  
so much is suffered? Itcannot promote health, nor ease  
pain; it makes no increase of merit in the person; it  
creates envy, it hastens misfortune.  
  
‘ But what madness must it be to run in debt for these  
superfluities! We are offered by the terms of this sale  
six months credit; and that perhaps has incuced some  
of us to attend it, because we cannot spare the ready  
money, and hope now to be fine without it. But ah!  
think what you do when you run in debt; you give to  
another power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at  
the time, you will be ashamed to see your creditor, you  
will be in fear when you speak to him, when you will  
make poor pitiful sneaking excuses, and by degrees  
come to.lose your veracity, and sink into base, down-  
right lying ; for, “the second vice is lying; the first is  
running in debt,” as poor Richard says; and again to  
the same purpose, “lying rides upon debt’s back ;”  
whereas a free-born Englishman ought not to be asham-  
ed nor afraid to see or speak to any man living. But  
poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue.  
“Itis hard for an empty bag to stand upright.” What  
would you think of that prince, or of that government,  
who should issue an edict forbidding you to dress like a  
gentieman or gentlewoman, on pain of imprisonment or  
servitude? Would you not say, that you were free,  
have a right to dress as you please, and that such an  
edict would be a breach of your privileges, and such a  
government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put  
yourself under that tyranny, when you run in debt for  
such dress! your creditor has authority, at his pleasure,  
to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in a  
gaol for life, or by selling you fora servant, if you should  
not be able to pay him. When you have got your bar-  
gain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but, as  
poor Richard says, “ creditors have better memories than  
debtors; creditors are a superstitious sect, great obser-  
vers of set-days and times.” The day comes round be-  
fore you are aware, and the demand is made before you  
are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in  
mini, the term, which at first seemed so long, will as it  
lessens, appear extremely short; time will seem to have  
added wings to his heels as well as his shoulders.—  
“Those havea short lent, who owe money to be paid at  
Easter.” At present, perhaps, you may think your-  
selves in thriving circumstances, and that you can bear  
a little extravagance without injury ; but  
  
‘‘ For age and want save while you may,  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.”  
Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while  
you live, expense is constant and certain; and, “it is|  
easicr to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel,” |  
as poor Richard says; so, “ rather go to bed supperless  
than rise in debt.”  
‘*Get what you can, and what you get hold,  
Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold.”’  
  
  
  
163  
And when you have got the philosopher’s stone, sure you  
will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty ot  
paying taxes.  
  
‘IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom ;  
but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own in.  
dustry, and frugality, and prudence, though excellent  
things; for they may all be blasted, without the bless  
ing of heaven; and thereforeask that blessing humbly,  
and be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to  
want it, but comfort and help them. Remember Job  
suffered, and was afterwards prosperous.  
  
‘And now, to conclude, “experience keeps a dear  
school, but fools will learn in no other,” as poor Rich-  
ard says, and scarce in that; for, it is true, “we may  
give advice, but we cannot give conduct:” however, re-  
member this, “ they that will not be counselled cannot  
be helped ;” and father, that “if you will not hear rea-  
son she will surely rap your knuckles,” as poor Rich-  
ard says.’  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The  
people heard it, and approved the doctrine ; and imme-  
diately practised the contrary, just as if it had been a  
common sermon, for the auction opened and they began  
to buy extravagantly.—I found the good man had tho-  
roughly studied my almanacs, and digested all I had  
dropt on those topics during the course of twenty-five  
years. The frequent mention he made of me mast have  
tired any one else: but my vanity was wonderfully de-  
lighted with it, though I was conscious, that not a tenth  
part of the wisdom was my own, which he ascribed to  
me, but rather the gleanings that I had made of the sense  
of all ages and nations. However, I resolved to be the  
better for the echo of it; and, though I had at first de-  
termined to buy stuff for a new coat, I went away, re-  
solved to wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if  
thou will do the same, thy profit will be as greatas mine.  
  
I am as ever, thine toserve thee,  
  
RICHARD SAUNDERS.

gous Reaper,—I have heard, that nothing gives  
PA pee: so great pleasure, as to find his works respect.  
fully quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I must  
have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate to  
ou. I stopped my horse lately, where a great number of  
z ople were collected, at an auction of merchants goods.  
The hour of the sale not being come, they were conversing  
on the badness of the times ; and one of the company  
called to a plain clean old man, with white locks, * Pray,  
Father Abraham, what think you of the times? Will not  
these heavy taxes quite ruin the country ? How shall we  
ever be able to pay them 2? What would you advise us to?”  
—Father Abraham stood up, and replied, ‘If you would  
have my advice, I will give it to you in short, ‘* for a word  
to the wise is enough,” as Poor Richard says.” They  
joined in desiring him to — his mind, and gathering  
round him, he proceeded as follows: _  
  
‘Friends,’ says he, ‘the taxes are, indeed, very heavy  
and, if those laid on by the government were the only ones  
we had to pay, we might more easily discharge them ; but  
we have many others, and much more grievous to some of  
us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleness, three  
times as much by our pride, and four times as much by  
our folly ; and from these taxes the commissioners cannot  
ease or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However,  
let us hearken to good advice, and something may be done  
for us ; “God helps them that help themselves,” as poor  
Richard says.  
  
‘* It would be thought a hard government that should  
tax its people one tenth part of their time, tobe employed  
in its service : but idleness taxes many of us much more ;  
sloth, by bringing on diseases, absolutely shortens life.  
** Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor wears, while  
the used key is always bright,” as poor Richard says.—  
** But dost thou love life, then do not squander time, for  
that is the stuff life is made of,” as poor Richard says.—  
How much more thanis necessary do we spend in sleep !  
forgetting, that “the sleeping fox catches no poultry, and  
that there will be sleeping enough in the grave,” as poor  
Richard says.  
  
‘+ Tf time be of all things the most precious, wasting time  
must be,” as poor Richard says, “‘ the greatest prodigali-  
y ;” since, as he elsewhere tells us, “ lost time is never  
  
ound again; and what we call time enough always proves  
little enough ;” let us then up and be doing, and doing to  
the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less  
perplexity. ‘‘ Sloth es all things difficult, but indus.  
try all easy; and he that riseth late, must trot all day, and  
shall scarce overtake his business at night; while laziness  
travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakeshim. Drive  
thy business, let not that drive thee; and early to bed,  
early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,”  
as poor Richard says.  
  
‘ So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times?  
We may make these times better, if we bestir ourselves.  
‘‘ Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon hope will  
die fasting. ‘There are no gains without pains ; then help  
hands, for I have no lands,” or, if I have, they are smart-  
ly taxed. ‘‘ He, that hath a trade, hath an estate ; and,  
he that hath a calling, hath an office of profitand honor,”  
as poor Richard says ; but then the trade must be worked  
at, and the calling well followed, or ncither the estate nor  
the office will enable tous pay our taxes. If we are in-  
  
dustrious, we shall never starve ; for, ‘‘ at the working  
man’s house, hunger locke in, but dares not enter.” Nor  
will the bailiff or the constable enter, for ‘‘ industry pays  
debts, while despair increaseth them.” What though you  
have found no treasure, nor has any rich relation left you  
a legacy, “diligence is the mother of good luck, and  
God gives all things to industry. Then plough deep,  
while sluggards sleep, and you shall have corn to sell and  
to keep.” Work while it is called to-day, for you know  
not how much you may be hindered to-morrow. ‘“ One  
to-day is worth two to-morrows,” as poor Richard says;  
and farther, “ never leave that till to-morrow, which you  
can do to-day.” If you were a servant, would you not be  
ashamed that a good master should catch you idle? Are  
you then your own master? Be ashamed to catch your-  
self idle, when there is so much to be done for yourself,  
your family, your country, and your king. Handle your  
tools without mittins ; remember, that ‘the catin gloves  
catches no mice,” as poor Richard says. It is true, there  
is much to be done, and perhaps you are weak-handed ;  
but stick to it steadily, and you will see great effects, for  
“constant dropping wears away stones; and by diligence  
and patience the mouse ate in two the cable; and little  
strokes fell great oaks.”  
  
* Methinks I hear some of you say, “‘ musta man afford  
  
  
  
* Dr. Franklin for many years published the Pennsylvania Almanac,  
called Poor Richard (Saunders,| and furnished it with various senten-  
ces and proverbs, which had principal relation to the topics of “ indus

himself no leisure?” I will tell thee, my friend; what  
poor Richard says ; ‘‘ employ thy time wellif thou mean.  
est to gain leisure ; and since thou are not sure of a min.  
ute, throw not away an hour.” Leisure is time for doin  
some thing useful; this leisure the diligent man will ob.  
tain, but the lazy mannever; for ‘‘a life of leisure anda  
life of laziness are two things. Many, without labor,  
would live by their wits only, but they break for want of  
stock ;” whereas industry gives comfort, and plenty, and  
respect. ‘ Fly pleasures, and they will follow you. The  
diligent spinner has a large shift ; and now I have a sheep  
and a cow, every one bids me gbod-morrow.”  
  
‘II. But with oufindustry we must likewise be steady,  
settled, and careful, and oversee our own affairs with our  
own eyes, and not trust too much to others ; for, as poor  
Richard says,  
  
“ T never saw an oft-removed tree,  
  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.”  
  
And again, “three removes is as bad as a fire ;” and  
again, ‘‘keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep the ;” and  
again, “if you would have your business done, go, if not,  
send.” And again,  
  
“ He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.”  
  
And again, “the eye of a master will do more work than  
both his hands ;” and again, ‘‘ want of care does us more  
damage than want of knowledge, and ;” again, “not to  
oversee workmen, is to leave them your purse open.”—  
Trusting too much to other’s care is the ruin of many ;  
for, “in the affairs of this world, men are saved, not by  
faith, but by the want of it ;” but a man’s own care is  
profitable ; for, “if you would have a faithful servant,  
and one that you like, serve yourself. A |little neglect  
may breed great mischief; for want of a nail the shoe  
was lost, and for want of a shoe the horse was lost, and  
for want of a horse the rider was lost,” being overtaken  
and slain by the enemy ; all for want of a little care about  
a horse-shoe nail.  
  
‘III. So much for industry, my friends, and attention  
to one’s own business ; but to these we must add frugality,  
if we would make our industry more certainly successful.  
A man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets,  
‘*keep his nose all his life to the grindstone, and die not  
worth a groat at last. A fat kitchen makes a lean will ;”  
and  
  
“ Many estates are spent in the getting,  
Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,  
And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.”  
“If you would be wealthy, think of saving, as well as of  
stting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, because  
her outgoes are greater than her incomes.”  
  
‘Away then, with your expensive follies, and you will  
not then have so much cause to complain of hard times,  
heavy taxes, and chargable families ; for,  
  
“ Women and wine, game and deceit,  
  
Make the wealth small, and the want great.”  
And farther, “ what maintains one vice, would bring up  
two children.” You may think, perhaps, that a little tea,  
or a little punch now and then, diet a little more costly,  
clethes a little finer, and a little entertainment now and  
.then, can be no great matter ; but remember, “‘ many a  
little makes a mickle.” Beware of little expenses; “a  
small leak will sink a great ship,” as poor Richard says ;  
andagain, “who dainties love, shall beggars prove ;” and  
moreover, ‘fools make feasts, an’ wise men eat them.”  
  
‘Here you are all got together to this sale of fineries  
and nick-nacks, You call them goods, but if you do not  
take care, they will prove evils to some of you. You ex-  
  
ect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may, for  
ess than they cost; but, if you have no ocoasion for them  
they must be dear to you. member what poor Richard  
says, “‘ buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou  
shalt sc ll thy necessaries.” And again, “ata great pen-  
ny-worth pause awhile.” He means, that perhaps the  
Ho Bio el is apparent only, and notreal; or the bargain  
by straitening thee in thy business, may do thee more  
harm than good. For in another place he says, ‘“‘ many  
have been ruined by buying good penny-worths.” Again,  
“it is foolish to ey. out money ina purehase of repentance;”  
and yet this folly is practiced every day at auctions, for  
want of minding the almanac. Many aone, for the sake

But little bens chaakd Keep aan shore.”  
It is, however, a folly soon punished ; for, as poor Richard  
says, ‘* pride that dines on vanity, sups on contempt ; pride  
breakfasted with plenty, dined with poverty, and supped  
with infamy.” And, after all, of what use is this pride of  
appearance, for which so much is risked, so much is suf.  
fered? It cannot A arorsv health, nor ease pain; it  
makes no increase of merit in the person; it creates envy,  
it hastens misfortune.  
  
* But what madness must it be to run in debt for these  
superfiuities! We are offered by the terms of this sale six  
months credit; and that perhaps has induced some of us  
to attend it, because we cannot spare the ready money,  
and hope now to be fine without it. Butah! think what  
you do when you run in debt ; you give to another power  
over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you  
will be ashamed to see your creditor, you will be in hear  
when you speak to him, when you will make poor pitiful  
sneaking excuses, and by degrees come to lose your vara-  
city, and sink into base, downright lying; for, the  
second vice is lying ; the first isrunning in debt” as poor  
Richard says ; and again tothe same pu » “lyi  
rides upon debt’s back ;” whereas a free-born Englishman  
ought not to be ashamed nor afraid to see or to any  
man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all spir-  
it and virtue. ‘“ Itis hard for an empty bag to stand up-  
right.” What would you think of that prince, or of that  
  
ernment, who should issue an edict forbidding you to  
Ties like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of impri-  
sonment or servitude ? ould you not say, that you were  
free, have a right to dress as you please, and that such an  
edict would be a breach of your privileges, and such a  
government tyrannieal? And yet you are about to put  
yourself under the tyranny, when you run in debt for such  
dress! your creditor has authority, at his pleasure, to de-  
prive you of your liberty, by sree you in a gaol for  
life, or by selling you for a servant, if you should not be  
able to pay him. When youhave got your bargain, you  
may, perhaps, think little of payment; but, as poor Rich.  
ard says, ‘‘ creditors have better memories than debtors ;  
creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set  
days and times.” The day comes round before you are  
aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared  
to satisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term,  
which at first seemed so long, will as it lessens, appear  
extremely short ; time wil! seem to have added wings to  
his heels as well as his shoulders. ‘+ Those have a short  
lent, who owe — to be paid at Easter.” At present,  
perhaps, you may think yourselves in thriving eircum.  
stances, and that you can bear a little extravagance with.  
out injury ; but  
. and want i  
Se mottion sua weseuie  
Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while you  
live expense is constant and certain ; and, “ it is easier  
to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel,” as poor  
maw oe says; so, “ rather go to bed supperless than rise  
in debt.”  
  
“ Get what an, aod w  
“The the stone t that will turn ah peed eed te gold.”  
  
And when you have got the philosopher’s stone, sure you  
will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty of  
  
ing taxes,  
  
‘IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom ;  
but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own in.  
dustry, and frugality, and ar gp though excellent  
things ; for they may all be blasted, without the blessing  
of heaven ; and therefore ask that blessing humbly,  
be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want  
  
and was afterwards prosperous.  
‘And now, to conclude, “ experience keeps a dear  
school, but fools will learn in no other,” as poor Richard  
says, and scarce in that ; for, it is true, ‘““we may give  
advicc, but we cannot give conduct:” however, remem.  
ber this, ‘‘ they that will not be counselled cannot be  
ed;” and farther, that “if you will not hear reason she  
will surely rap your knuckles,” as poor Richard says,’  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. T  
ple heard it, and approved the doctrine; and

I have heard, that nothing gives an author so great  
pleasure as to find his works respectfully quoted by  
others. Judge, then, how much I must have been  
gratified by an incident I am going to relate to you.  
I stopped my horse lately where a great number of  
people were collected at an auction of merchants’  
goods. The hour of the sale not being come, they  
were conversing on the badness of the times; and  
one of the company called to a plain, clean old man,  
with white locks, Pray, father Abraham, what think  
you of the times? Will not these heavy taxes quite  
ruin the country? How shall we ever be able to pay  
them? What would you advise usto? Father Abra-  
ham stood up, and replied, If you would have my  
advice, I will give it to you in short, ‘‘ for a word  
the wise is enough,” as Poor Richard says. They  
joined in desiring him to speak his mind, and gather-  
ixg round him, he proceeded as follows:  
  
‘riends, says he, the taxes are indeed very heavy,  
and if those laid on by the government were the only  
ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge  
them; but we have many others, and much more  
grievous to some of us. Weare taxed twice as much  
by our idleness, three times as much by our pride,  
and four times as much by our folly ; and from these  
taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us, by  
allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to  
good advice, and something may be done for 08;  
“ God helps them that help themselves,” as Poor Ri-  
chard says.  
  
I. It would be thought a hard government that  
should tax its people one-tenth of their time, to  
employed in its service; but idleness taxes man  
us much more; sloth, by bringing on diseases,

office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are in. |

“If you would be wealthy, think of saving, as well  
as of getting. The Indies have not made Spain

Away, then, with your expensive follies, and you

hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families ; for  
  
“Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth smull, and the want great.’’

more costly, clothes a little finer, and a little enter-  
tainment now and then, can be no great matter ; but  
remember, “ many a little makes a mickle.” Beware

fortune.  
  
But what madness must it be to run in debt for  
these superfluities! We are offered, by the terms of  
this sale, six months’ credit; and that perhaps hasin-  
duced some of us to attend it, because we cannot  
spare the ready money, and hope now to be fine with-  
out it. Butah! think what you do when you run in  
debt; you give to another power over your liberty.  
If you cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed  
to see your creditor ; you will be in fear when you  
speak to him, when you will make poor, pitiful,  
sneaking excuses, and by degrees come to lose your  
veracity, and sink into base, downright lying; for  
“the second vice is lying; the first is running in  
debt,” as Poor Richard says; and again, to the same  
purpose, “ lying rides upon debt’s back;” whereas a  
free-born Englishman ought not to be ashamed nor  
afraid to see or speak to any man living. But po-  
verty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue.  
|“ Ttis hard for an empty bag to set upright.” What  
| would you think of that prince, or of that  
  
ment, who should issue an edict forbidding you to  
| dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of  
| imprisonment or servitude? Would you not say that  
| you were free, have a right to dress as you please,  
| and that such an edict would be a breach of your  
privileges, and such a government tyrannical? .And  
yet you are about to put yourself under that tyranny,  
when you ran in debt for such dress! your creditor  
has authority, at his pleasure, to deprive you of your  
liberty, by confining you in jail for life, or by selling  
| you for a servant, if you should not be able to pay  
him. When you have got your bargain, you may,  
perhaps, think little of payment; but, as Poor Ri

What though you have found no treasure, nor has |  
any rich relation left you a legacy, “ diligence is the  
mother of good luck, and God gives all things to in-  
dustry. Then plough deep while sluggards sleep,  
and you shall have corn to sell and to keep.” Work |  
while it is called to-day, for you know not how much  
you may be hindered to-morrow. ‘One to-day is |  
worth two to-morrows,” as Poor Richard says ; and |  
farther “ never leave that till to-morrow, which you |  
can do to-day.”’ If you were a servant, would you  
not be ashamed thata good master should catch you  
idle? Are you then your own master? Be ashamed |  
tocatch yourself idle, when there is so much.to be |  
done for yourself, your family, your country, and your |  
king. Handle your tools without mittens ; remember |  
that “ the cat in gloves catches no mice,” as Poor Ri-  
chard says. It is true there is much to be done, and |  
perhaps you are weak-handed; but stick to it stea-  
dily, aad you will see great effects, for “ constant  
dropping wears away stones;’’ and “ by diligence and |  
patience the mouse ate in two the cable ; and little  
strokes fell great oaks.”  
  
Methinks I hear some of you say, “‘ must a man  
afford himself no leisure?” I will tell thee, my  
friend, what Poor Richard says; “ employ thy time

known before, if they had taken his advice; “ if you  
would know the value of money, go and try to borrow  
some; for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrow-  
ing,’’ as Poor Richard says; and indeed so does he  
that lends to such people, when he goes to get it  
again. Poor Dick further advises, and says,  
  
* Fond pride of dress is sure a curse ;  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.”  
  
And again, “ pride is as loud a beggar as want, and  
great deal more saucy.” When you have bought one  
fine thing, you must buy ten more, that your appear-  
ance may be all of a piece; but Poor Dick says, “ it  
is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all  
that follow it;” and it is as truly folly for the pdor to  
ape the rich, as for the frog to swell inorder to equal  
the ox.  
“ Vessels b ure  
But little boats si odd bapame. the shore.”  
  
It is, however, a folly soon punished; for, as Poor  
Richard says, “ pride that dines on vanity, sups on  
contempt ; pride breakfasted with plenty, dined with  
poverty, and supped with infamy.” And, after all,  
of what use is this pride of appearance, for which so  
much is risked, so much is suffered ? it cannot pro

time will seem to have added wings to his heels as  
  
| well as hisshoulders. “ Those will have a short lent,  
| who owe money to be paid at easter.” At present,  
| perhaps, you may think yourselves in thriving cir-  
cumstances, and that you can bear a little extrava-  
gance without injury; but  
“ For age and want save while you may,  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.”  
  
|Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever  
while you live, expense is constant and certain; a  
  
| “itis easier to build two chimneys than to keep one  
in fuel,” as Poor Richard says; so, “ rather go to bed  
superless than rise in debt.”  
  
“ Get what you can, and what you get hold;  
&quot;Tis the stone that will vurn all your lead into gold.”  
  
| And when you have got the philosopher’s stone, sure  
you will no longer complain of hard times, or the dif-  
| ficulty of paying taxes.  
  
IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wis-  
dom ; but, after all, do not depend too much upon  
your own industry, and frugality, and prudence,  
though excellent things; for they may all be blasted,  
without the blessing of heaven; and therefore ask  
that blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to those  
that at present seem to want it, but comfort and help  
them. Remember Job suffered, and was afterwards  
prosperous.  
  
And now, to conclude, “experience keeps a dear  
school, but fools will learn in no other,” as Poor Ri-  
chard says, and scarce in that; for, it is true, “ we  
may give advice, but we cannot give conduct ;” how-  
ever, remember this; ‘they that will not be coun-  
selled, cannot be helped ;” and farther, that “if you  
will not hear reason, she will surely rap your  
knuckles,” as Poor Richard says.  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The  
people heard it, and approved the doctrine ; and im-  
mediately practised the contrary, just as if it had  
been a common sermon ; for the auction o » and  
they began to buy extravagantly. I fou Pas. gned  
man had thoroughly studied my almanacs, di-  
gested all that I had dropt on those topics during the  
course of twenty-five years. The frequent mention  
he made of me must have tired any one else; butm  
vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, though 1  
was conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom was  
my own, which he abscribed to me, but rather the  
gleanings that I had made of the sense of all  
and nations. However, I resolved to be the better for  
the echo of it; and, though I had at first determined  
to buy stuff for a new coat, I went away resolved to  
wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt

Couateocs ReAders:  
I have heard that nothing gives an author so  
much pleasure as to find his works respectfully  
quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I must  
have been gratified by an accidont I am going to re­  
late to you. I stopped my hore lately, where great  
number of people were collected an auction of mer­  
 chant&#x27;s goods. The hour of sale not being come,  
they were conversing on the baduess of the times;  
and one of the company called to a plain, clean old  
man, with white locks, &quot;pray, father Abraham, what  
think you of the times? Will not these heavy taves  
quite ruin the country? How shall we ever be able  
to pay thein? What would you advise uis to do?&quot;  
Father Abraham stood up and replied,  If you would  
have my advice, I will give it you in short, for  
a word to the wise is enough,&quot; as poor Richard  
says.&quot;  
They joined in desiring him to speak his mind  
and gathering around him, he proceeded as follows  
Friends, says, the taxes are indeed very heavy;  
and if those laid on by the Government were the on  
ly ones we had to pay, we might easily dischaige  
them; but we have many others, and much more  
grevious to some of us. We are taxed twice as  
much by our idleness, three times as much by our  
pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from  
these faxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver  
us by allowing an abatement  
However, let us hearken to good advice, and  
something may be done for us; &quot;Ged helps them that  
help themselves,&quot; as Poor Richard says.  
In the &quot;Carolinian,&quot; published in Sumt er district  
South Carolina, of the 10th inst., we find a letter  
written from Philadelphia, describing a spectacle  
once witnessened here, an dwhich may refresh the

Poor Richards says. It is trje, there ii

ing something useful; &#x27;.his leisure the dili­

they break for want of -stock;&quot; whereas

likewise oversee our own affairs with our  
own ey; and not trust too much to others

- Head quarters, April 27tb, 1779.  
It would be thought a hard government  
that should tax its people ona-tenth part  
of their time to be employed in its service;  
but idleness taxes many much more, if we  
reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth,  
or doing nothing, with that which is spent  
ra idle amusements, or employ meats that  
amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing  
diseases, absolutely shortens life.—  
Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor  
wears, while the key often used is always  
bright. — Franklin.

respectfully quoted by othen. Judge,  
then, hoar much I mutt have been  
gratified by an incident I am going to  
relate to you. I itopped my hone lately,  
where a great number of people were  
collected, at an auction of merchant!&#x27;  
goodt. Tbe hour of the tale not being  
come, they were converting on the  
badnets of the limes; and one of tbe  
company called to a plain clean old man,  
with white locki, ? Pray, Father  
Abraham, what think you of the timet ?  
Will not tuese heavy taxis quite ruin  
the country ? How shall we ever be able  
to pay them ? What would you advise ut  
to ?&#x27; Father Abraham btood up, and  
reDlied. ? If vou would have my advice,  
I will give it you in ihort, &#x27; for a  
word to the wite is rnough,&#x27; as poor  
Richard says.&#x27; They joined in detiring j  
him lo tpeak liis mind, and, gathering  
round j him, he proceeded at followt :—  
? Friend,1 says he, ? the taxes are,  
indeed, very heavy, and, if those laid  
on by the government were the only ones  
we bad to pay, we might more eaiily  
discharge them ; but we have many othen,  
and aiuch more grievoui to some &#x27; of ui.  
We are tated twice as much by our &#x27;  
idleness, three timei as much by our  
piide, and four times at much by our  
folly ; and from these Uses tbe  
conimiuionen cannot ease or deliver ut,  
by allowing an abatement. However, let  
ut hearken to good advice, and something  
may be done for us; &#x27;God helps them that  
help themtelvei,&#x27; at poor Richard tays.  
I. It would be thought a hard government  
that should lax tbe people one-tenth  
part of their time, to be employed in  
its service : but idleness uses many of  
us much more ; tlotk, by bringing on  
diseases, absolutely shortens life. &#x27;  
Sloth, like rust, coatumet ratter than  
labour wean, while the used key is  
alwayt bright,&#x27; as poor Richard tays. ?-  
But doit thou love life, then do not  
tquander time, for that it the Muff life  
it made of,&#x27; as poor Richard says. How  
much wore tban it necessary do we tpend  
in sleep! forgetting, that ?? the  
tleeping fox catches no poultry, and  
that there will be sleeping enough in  
the grave,&#x27; as pool Richard says. ?- If  
time be or all things the meat precict,  
wasting titue mutt be,&#x27; as poor Richard  
tays, &#x27; tbe greatest prodigality ;&#x27;  
tincc. at he elsewhere tells ut, &#x27; lull  
time it never found again; and what we  
call tiuie enough provet little enough :  
&#x27; let ut then up and be doing, and doing  
to the purpose ; so by diligence stall  
we do more with less perplexity. &#x27;?  
Sloth makes all things difficult, but  
industry all easy ; and he that ritcth  
late must trot all the day, and ihall  
scarce overtake hit buiinets at night;  
while laiineu travels so slowly, that  
poverty soon overtakes him. Drive thy  
business, let not that drive thee: and  
eaily to bed.andearlv to rite, niaket a  
man healthy, wealthy, and wise,&#x27; at poor  
Kichard says. ? So what tignifiei  
wishing and hoping for belter times t We  
may make these times better, if we  
bestir ourselves. &#x27; lodusiry need not  
wish, and be that lives upon hops will  
die failing. There are no gains without  
paint; then help bands, for I have no  
landt,&#x27; or, if I have, they are imartly  
taxed. -? He that hatb a trade, hath an  
ettate i and he that hath a calling,

poor Richard says ; but then the trade  
must be worked, and the calling well  
followed, or neither the estate nor the  
oBce will enable ut to pay our taxes. If  
we are industrious, we shall never  
starve ; for, &#x27; at the working man&#x27;s

you otay be hindered to-morrow. -? One  
to-day it worth two to-morrows,&#x27; as poor  
Richard says; and, farther, &#x27; never  
leave that till to-Bwrrow, which you can  
do to-day.&#x27; If you were a tenant, would  
you not be ashamed tliat s good niabtci  
tliuulil Caleb you idle ? Are you then  
your own master ? Be ashamed to catch  
younelf iillr, when tbrie ii. so much to  
be done for younelf. your family, your  
countiy, and your king. Hundle jour  
tools without mittens remember, &#x27;that  
the cat in gloves catcbes no mice,&#x27; as  
poor Ricliaid tayt. It is true Ibere it  
much lo I* done, and priliaptyou are  
wrak-liaoJed ; but slick lo it steadily,  
and you nil! tee great effect i, for  
&#x27;constant dropping wean away ttones ;  
and by diligrncc and patience the mouse  
ate in two the cable; and little stroket  
fell great oaks.&#x27; ? Melhinkt 1 hear mme  
of you lay, &#x27;roust a man afford himself  
no leisure ?&#x27; I will tell thee, my  
friend, what poor Richard tayt; &#x27;employ  
thy time well, if thou meanest to gain  
leisure ; and tince thou art not lure of  
a minute, throw not away tn hour.&#x27;  
Leiture it lime for doing tometkiiiL&#x27;  
uteful ; this leisure the diligent man  
will obtain, but the laiy man never; for  
&#x27;? a lire of leiiure and a life of lazi.  
ness are two things. Many, without  
laboui, would live by their witt only,  
but they break for want of stock ;&#x27;  
whereas industry givct comfort, and  
plenty, and retpect. &#x27;? Fly pleasures,  
and they will follow you. The diligent  
spinner hat a large shift ; and now I  
have a tbeep and a cow, eveiy body bids  
me good? II. But with our industry we  
must likewise be steady, settled, and  
careful, and oversee our own affairs  
witb our own eyes, and not trust too  
much to othen; for, at poor Richard  
says, 11 I never saw an oft-removed  
tree, Nor yet an oft-rempved family.  
That throve so well at those that  
settled be.&#x27; And again, &#x27; three removes  
are as bad at a Ere ;&#x27; and again, &#x27; keep  
thy tho|i, anil Ihy thop will keep thee  
;&#x27; and again, &#x27; if you would have your  
buiiuejt done, go; if not, lead.&#x27; And  
attain — &#x27; He that by tbe plough would  
thrive. Himself muit either hold or  
drive.&#x27; And again, &#x27; the eye of a mailer  
will do more work than both bis hands ;&#x27;  
and again, &#x27; want of care does ut more  
damage tban want of knowledge ;&#x27; and  
again, &#x27; not to oversee workmen, it to  
leave them your pane open.&#x27; Trust, ing  
too much to others&#x27; care is the ruin of  
many ; for, &#x27;? in the affairs of the  
world, men are laved, not by faith, but  
by the want of it;&#x27; but a man&#x27;s own care  
is profitable ; for, &#x27; if you would have  
a faithful tervaut, and one you like,  
serve younelf. A little neglect may  
breed great mischief; for want of a nail  
tbe iboe was lost, and for want of a  
iboe the hone was lost, and for want of  
a boree the rider was lost,&#x27; being  
overtaken and ilain by the enemy ; all  
for want of a little enre abjul a horse  
-iboe nail. ? III. So much for induttry,  
my friendt, and attention to one&#x27;s own  
butinen; but to these we must add  
frugality, if we would make our industry  
more successful. A man may, if he knows  
not how to tare at he gett, &#x27;? keep hit  
note all hia life to the grindstone, and  
die not worth a groat at lait. A fat  
kilcben makes a lean will ;&#x27; and ?? Many  
estates are spent in the getting, Since  
women for tea forsook spinning and  
knitting. And men for punch forsook  
hewing and splitting.&#x27; &#x27; If you would be  
wealthy, think of saving, at well at of  
getting. The Indies have not made Spain  
rich, because her outgoes are greater  
than her incomes.&#x27; ? Away, then, with  
your expensive follies, and you will not  
then have so much cause to complain of  
bard times, heavy taiet, and chargeable  
families ; for &#x27; Women and wine, game  
and deceit, Make the wealth small, and  
tbe want great.&#x27; And farther, &#x27;? what  
maintains one vice, would bring up two  
children.&#x27; You may think, perhaps, that  
a little tea. or a little punch now aud  
then, diet a little more costly, clot  
bet a little finer, and a little  
entertainment now and then, can be no  
great matter; but remember, &#x27; many a  
little make! a mirkle.&#x27; Beware of little  
expenses ; &#x27; a imall leak will link a  
great iliip,&#x27; at poor Richard says ; and  
again, &#x27; who dainties love, shall  
beggars prove ; and moreover, &#x27;fools  
make feattt, and wite men eat them.&#x27; ?  
Here you are all got together to thit  
sale of fnerietand knick.nacki. You call  
them roo-f-.-but, if you do not take  
care, they will piove tvili to tome of  
you. You eipect they will be told cheap,  
and perhapt they may, for leu than they  
cost; but, if you have no occasion for  
them, they mutt be dear to you. Remember  
what poor Richard taj-, &#x27; buy what tbou  
hast no need of, and ere long thou thalt  
tell thy neceiiaries.&#x27; And again, ?&#x27; at  
a great penny, worth pause a while.&#x27; He  
meant, that perhaps the cheapness ii  
apparent only, and not real ; or the  
bargain, by itraitcning thee in thy  
buiinen, may do thee more harm than  
good. For in another place be lays, &#x27;  
many bate been ruined by buying good  
penny-worths.&#x27; Again, &#x27; it is foolisb to  
lay out money in a purchase or  
repentance;&#x27; and yet tbii folly is  
practised every day at auctions, for  
want of minding tbe almanack. Many a  
one, for the sake of Gnery on the back,  
bate gone with a hungry belly, and half  
starved their families ; &#x27; silks and  
satim, scarlet and velvets, put out tbe  
kitchen fire,&#x27; as poor Richard says.  
These are not the oecestariet of life,  
they can scarcely be called the  
conveniences ; and yet, only became they  
look nrettv. how man* want tn ha** Ihpn,  
By these and other extravaganciet, the  
genteel are reduced to poverty, and  
forced to borrow of those whom they  
formerly detpiied, but who, through  
industry and fiugality, have main,  
laioed their standing ; in wbicb case it  
appears plainly, that &#x27; a ploughman on  
bis legs it higher than a gentleman on  
hit kneet,&#x27; at poor Richard ssyt.  
Perhaps the) have bad a small estate  
left them, which they knew not the  
getting of; they think &#x27;it ii day, and  
never will be night;&#x27; that a little to  
be tpent out of so much is not worth  
minding; but &#x27;always taking out of the  
meal-tub, and never putting in, soon  
comet to the bottom,&#x27; as poor Richard  
says ; and then, &#x27; when tbe well it dry,  
they know the worth of water.&#x27; But thii  
they might have known before, if they  
had taken bit advice: &#x27;if you would know  
the value of money, go and try to borrow  
some ; for he that goes a borrowing goes  
a sorrowing,&#x27; at poor,&#x27; Richard says ;  
and indeed so does be that lends to sucb  
people, wnen he goes to get it in again.  
Poor Dick farther advises, and says— &#x27;  
Fond pride of dress it sure a very  
curse. Ere fancy you consult, consult  
your purse.&#x27; Aod again, &#x27; pride it at  
loud a beggar at want, and a great deal  
more saucy.&#x27; When you have bought one  
tiling fine, you mutt buy ten more, that  
your appearance may be all or a piece  
but poor Dick sayt, &#x27; it is easier to  
tuppresi the Snt desire tban to latiify  
all that follow it :&#x27; and it ii at truly  
folly for the poor to ape the rich, at  
for the fivg to twell, in order to equal  
the ox. &#x27; Vessels large mty venture  
more. But little boats should keep near  
shore.&#x27; It it, however, a folly soon  
puniihed ; for, as poor Richard says, &#x27;  
pride that dines on vaoity, sups on  
contempt: pride breakfasted witb plenty,  
dined with poverty, and supped with  
infamy.&#x27; And, after all, of what uk it  
thit pride of appearance, for which so  
much is i isked, to much is tuffered ?  
It caaaot promote health, nor case pain  
; it taakes ad increase of merit in the  
person ; it creates ei^y, it hatlcni  
misfortunes. ? But what madness Bust It  
W to raw in debt tot these tuperluilies!  
We are offered) by the tcrau of thii  
tale, til months&#x27; credit | and that,  
pcihaps, has induced some of us t»  
attend it, because we cannot spare the  
ready money, and hope now to be Ina  
without it. But ah ! think what you do  
when you run in debt; you give to  
another power over your liberty. If you  
cannot pay at the tiuie, you will be  
ashamed to tee your creditor ; you will  
be in fear whan you ipaak to him ; you  
will aaks poor, pitiful, sneaking  
eicutet ; and, by legieet, come to lose  
your veracity, and link into bute,  
downrijjlit lying j fur &#x27;the second «ice  
is lying, lie frit is running in debt,&#x27;  
at poor Richard says; and again, to the  
tame purpo-e, &#x27; lying rides upon debt&#x27;s  
back ;&#x27; whereas a free-born Englishman.  
ought nut to be ashamed, nor afraid to  
see or tpeak to any wan living. But  
poverty often depii«ci a man of all  
spirit and virtue. &#x27; It it hard for an  
empty bag tn stand upright.&#x27; What would  
you think or that prince, or oftliat  
government, who should issue an edict,  
forbidding; you to drcu like a gentleman  
or gentlewoman, on pain of imprisonment  
or temtude? Would you not lay, that )ou  
were free— have a right to drew as you  
pleaie— aud that such an edict would be  
a-breach of your privilege!, and tuch a  
government tyrannical ? And yet you are  
about to put yourself under that  
tyranny, when you run in debt for such  
dre.i &#x27;. Your creditor hat authority, at  
his pleasure, to deprive you or your  
lilierty, by confining you in gaol for  
lire, or by selling you fol&#x27; a servant,  
if you should oot be able lo pay iiitu.  
When you have got your bargain, you may,  
perhaps, think little or payment ; but,  
as poor Richard says, &#x27;ciedilors have  
better memories than debtors&#x27; —  
&#x27;citditors are a lUDerstitiout ifk-great  
obterveit of set dayt and times.&#x27; The  
day comes round before you are aware,  
and the demand is made before you are  
prepared to ?atiifyit; ur. if you bear  
the debt in mind, the term which at Grst  
seemed so long, will, as h Insert,  
appear extremely tuort ; tine will mUn  
to have added wings to his beds at well  
at kit tlioulden. &#x27; Those have a short  
Lent, who owe nioney to be paid at  
Easter.&#x27; At present, perhaps, you may  
think yourselves in thriving  
circumstance!, and thai you can bear a  
little extravagance without injury ; but  
&#x27;? For age and want save while you may,  
No luorninn tun lasts a whole daw.&#x27; Bain  
may be temporary and uncertain, but  
ever, while you live, eipente it  
constant and certain ; and &#x27; it ii  
easier to build two chimneys tban to  
keep one in fuel,&#x27; as poor Richard tayt:  
so &#x27; rather go to bed supperless tban  
rise jn debt.&#x27; &#x27;? Get what you can, and  
what you get hold ; &#x27;Tis the stone that  
will turn all your lead into gold&#x27; And  
when you have got tbe  
pbilosophei&#x27;rstone, sure you will no  
longer complain of bad timci, or the  
difficulty of paying taxes. ? IV. This  
doctrine, my friends, it reason and  
wiidoai: but, after all, do not depend  
too much upon your own industry, and  
frugality, and piudence, though  
excellent things; for they may all be  
blasted, without the blesting from  
Heaven ; and therefore ask that blessing  
humbly, and be not uncharitable to those  
that at present seem to want it, but  
comfort and help them. Remember Job  
suffered, aud was afterward! prosperous.  
? And now, to conclude, &#x27; experience  
keeps a dear school, but fools will  
learn in no other,&#x27; at poor Richard  
says, and scarce in that ; for, it is  
true, &#x27; we may give advice, but we  
cannot give conduct :&#x27; however, remember  
thit, ?? they that will oot be  
counselled cannot be helped ;&#x27; and  
farther, that &#x27;if you will not bear  
reason, ?he will turely rap your  
knuckles,&#x27; as poor Kichard says.&#x27; Tbut  
the old gentleman ended his harangue.  
The poor people heard it, and approved  
the doctrine ; and immediately practised  
the contrary, just ai if it had been a  
common sermon. for the auction opened,  
and they began to buy eitiavagantly. I

any one else ; but my vanity was  
wonderfully delighted with it, though I

to me, but rather the gleanings that I

Ps Covrrgous Reaver:—I have heard, that nothing gives an author so great pleasure,

Peatas| have been gratified by an incident I am going torelate to you. I stopped my horse

| goods. The hour of the sale not being come, they were conversing on the badness of 2  
  
Perize| the times;and one of the company called to a plain clean old man, with white locks, | #  
  
saeee:| “Pray, Father Abraham, what think you of the times? Will not these heavy taxes [40%  
s=%| quite ruinthe country?’ How shall weever be able to pay them? What would you [gre  
| advise us to?”’—Father Abraham stood up, and replied, “If you would have my ad- (24a  
  
PPzEmG| Vice, I will give it to you in short, ‘for a word 2 the wise is enough,’ as poor Rich. a  
  
ppeees| ard says. They joined in desiring him to speak his mind, and gathering around him, [ey  
  
p—| he proceeded as follows: pao  
  
“Friends,” says he, ‘the taxes are indeed, very heavy, and, if those laid on by the  
government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge ems  
but we have many others, and much more grievous to some of us. We are taxed  
twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four times as  
much by our folly; and from these taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us  
by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice and something  
may be done for us; “God helps them that help themselves.”  
  
1. “It would be thought a hard government that should tax its people the one tenth  
part of their time, to be employed in its service; but idleness taxes many of us much  
more; sloth, by bringing on diseases, absolutely shortens life. “Sloth, like rust, eon-  
sumes faster than laber wears, while the used key is always bright. “But dost thou  
love life, then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of.” How much  
more than is necessary do we spend in sleep! forgetting, that “the sleeping fox ca’  
es no poultry, and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave,” as poor Ric  
says.  
  
“If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be the greatest prod-  
igality; since “lost time is never found again;and what we call time enough alwa  
proves little enough;” let us then be up anddoing, and doing to the purpose; so by  
diligence shall we do more with less perplexity. ‘Sloth makes all things “hifficalt, but  
industry, all easy; and he that riseth late, must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake  
his business at night: while laziness travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes him.  
Drive thy business, let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to rise, makes  
men healthy, wealthy, and wise,” as poor Richard says.  
  
“So what — wishing and hoping for better times? We may make these times  
better, if we tir ourselves. “Industry need not wish, and he that lives-upon

hope will die fasting There are no gains without pains; then help hands, for I have  
no lands,”’ or, if I have, they are smartly taxed. ‘He that hath a trade, hath an estate;  
and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honor;’”? but then the trade  
must be worked at, and the calling well followed, or neither the estate nor the office  
will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are industrious, we shall never starve; for, “‘at  
the working man’s house, hunger looks in but dares not enter.’’ Nor will the bailiff  
  
_ or the constable enter, for industry pays debts, while despair increaseth them.’’ What  
though you have found no treasure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, “dili-  
gence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to industry. Then plow  
deep, while sluggards sleep, and es shall have corn to sell and to keep.”” Work  
  
while it is called to-day, for youknow not how much you may be hindered to-morrow.  
*‘One to-day is worth two to-morrows,” and farther ‘“‘never leave that till to-morrow,  
which you can do to-day.”” If you were a servant, would you not be ashamed that a  
good master should catch you idle? Are you then your own master? Be ashamed te  
catch yourself idle, when there is so much to be done for yourself, your family, your  
country, and yourGod. Handle your tools without mittens; remember that “the cat  
in gloves catches no mice,” as poor Richard says. It is true, there is much to be  
done, and perhaps you are weak-handed; butstick to it steadily, and you will see  
great effects, for “‘constant dropping wears away stones; and by diligence and patience  
the mouse ate in two the cable; and little strokes fell great oaks.”’  
  
“Methinks I hear some of you say, “must a man afford himself no leisure?”’ I will  
tell thee, my friend, what poor Richard says: “employ thy time well, if thou meanest  
to gain leisure; and since thou art not sure of a minute, throw not away an hour.”  
Leisure is time for doing something useful; this leisure the diligent man will obtain,  
but the lazy man never; for “alife of leisure and a life of laziness are two things.—  
Many, without labor, would live by their wits only, but they break for the want of  
stock ;”” whereas industry gives comfort, and plenty, and respect. “Fly pleasures,  
and they willfollow you. The diligent spinner has a large shift; and now I have a  
sheep and a cow, every one bids me good morrow.”  
  
“II. But with our industry we must likewise be steady, settled and careful, and  
oversee our own affairs with,our own eyes, and not trust too much to others; for, as  
poor Richard says:  
  
“T never saw an oft-removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.”  
  
And again, ‘three removes are bad asa fire;’’ and again, “keep thy shop, and thy

OeRRS “Away then, with your expensive follies, and you will not then have so much  
pees} cause to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and c families; for  
= “Women and wine, game and deeeit, .  
ane Make the wealth small, and the want great.”  
et:| And farther, “what maintains one vice, would bring up two children”’ You may  
— think, perhaps, that-a little tea, ora little punch, now and then, diet a little more  
  
‘|  
  
costly, clothes a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great  
matter; but remember, ‘“‘many.a little makes a mickle.”” Beware of little expenses:—  
“a small leak will sink a t ship,” as poor Richard says; and again, ‘who dainties  
love shall beggars prove;’’ and moreover, “fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.’  
“Here you are all got together to this sale of fineries and nick-nacks. You call  
them Goons, but if you do not take care, they will prove EviLs to some of you. You  
expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may, for less than they cost—but if  
= have no occasion for them, they must be dear to you. Remember what Poor  
ichard says, “buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy neces-  
saries.” And again, “at a great penny-worth, pause awhile.” He means, t per-  
haps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by straitening thee  
in thy business, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place, he sa  
“many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths.” Again, “‘it is foolish to lay  
out money in a purchase of repentance;’; and yet this folly is practiced every day at  
| auctions, for want of minding the almanac. Many a one, forthe sake of finery on the  
back, have gone with a hungry belly, and half starved their families; “silks and satins,  
scarlet and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,’ as poor Riehard says. Theseare not the  
necessaries of life, doy can scarcely be called the conveniences; and yet, only because  
| they look pretty, how many want to have them? By these and other extravagancies,  
%;| the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly  
| despised, but who, through industry and frugality have maintained their standing; in  
which case it appears plainly, that “a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentle-  
man on his knees. Perhaps they had a small estate left them, which they knew not  
the getting of; they think “it is day, and it will never be night;” that a little to be  
spent out of so much is not worth minding; but always taking out of the meal tub  
| and neve? putting in, soon comes to the bottom,” and then, “when the well is dry,  
they know the worth of water.”” But this they might have known before, if they had  
taken the advice: “if you would know the value ofmoney, go and try to borrow some;  
for he that’ goes a borrowing, goes a sorrowing,”’ as poor Richard says; and indeed so  
does he that lends to such people, when he goes to get it again. Poor Dick farther  
advises, and says, a  
“Fond pride of dress is sure a curse,  
Ere faney you consult, consult your purse.”

be all of a piece; but poor Dick says, “‘it is easier to suppress the first desire, than to  
satisfy all that follow it;” and itisas truly folly forthe poor to ape the rich, as for the  
frog to swell in order to equal the ox.  
  
“Vessels large, may venture more,  
  
But little boats should keep near shore.”  
It is, however, a folly soon punished; for as poor Richard says, “pride that dines on  
  
‘| vanity, sups on contempt; pride breakfasted with pienty, dined with poverty, and sup-  
| ped with infamy.” And afterall, of what use is this pride of appearance, for which  
  
so much is risked, so much is suffered? It cannot promote health, nor ease pain; it  
makes no increase of merit in the person; it creates envy, it hastens misfortune.  
  
“But what madness must it be to RUN IN DEBT for these superfluities! We are offer-  
ed by the terms of this sale six months credit; and that perhaps has induced some of  
us to attend it, because we cannot spare the ready money, and hope now to be fine  
without it. But ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another  
power over yourliberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see  
  
‘your creditor: you will be in fear when you speak to him, when you will make poor,  
  
itiful, sneaking excuses, and by degreescome to lose your veracity, and sink into  
downright lying; for, ‘the second vice is lying; the first is running in debt,” as  
poor Richard says; and again to the same purpose, “lying rides upon debts back ;’’—  
whereas a free-born man ought not to be ashamed nor afraid te see or speak to any  
  
| man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue. “It is hard  
| for an empty bag to stand upright. What would yon think of that prince, or of that  
  
government, who should issue an edict forbidding you t&gt; dress like a gentleman or  
  
} agentleweman, on pain of.imprisonment or servitude? Would you not say, that you  
  
were free, have a right to dress as you please, and that such an edict would be a  
  
| breach of your privileges,and such a government tyrannical? And yet you are about  
  
to put yourself under that tyrrany, when you run in debt forsuch dress! Your cred-  
itor has authority, at his pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in  
= for life, or by selling yeu for a servant, if you should not be able to pay him—  
  
hen you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but  
“creditors have better memories than debtors; creditorsare a superstitious sect, great  
observers of set days and times.’’ The day comes around before you are aware, and  
the demand is made before you are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in  
mind, the term, which at first seemed so long, will as it lessens, appear extremely  
short; time will seem to have added wings to his heels as well as his shoulders. ‘Those  
have a short lent, who owe money to be paid at Easter.’ At present, perhaps, you  
  
| may think yourselves in thriving circumstances, and that you can bear a little extrav-  
  
agance without injury; but  
“For age and want save while you may,  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.”  
  
- Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while you live, expense is constant  
  
and certain; and, “it is easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel;’’ se,  
rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt.”  
“Get what you can, and what you get hold,  
*Tis the stone that will turn your lead into gold.”  
And when you have got the Philosopher’s stone, sure you will no longer complain of  
bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.  
IV. “This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom; but afterall, do not depend  
  
| too much upon your own industry, and frugality, fand prudence, though excellent  
| things; for th

Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and approved

had thoroughly studied my almanacs, and digested all I had dropped on those topics  
during the course of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made of me must  
have tired any one else; but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, though I

have been gratified by an incident I amg­  
ing to relate to you. I stopped my horse  
lately, where a great number of people  
ere collected, at an auction of merchant&#x27;s  
goods. The hour of sale not being come,  
they were conversing on the badness of the  
times; and one of the company called to a  
plain clean old man, with white locks,  
&quot;Pray, Father Abraham, what think you of  
the times? Will not these heary taxes  
quite ruin the country? How shall we ever  
be able to pay them? What would you ad­  
ise us to do?&quot;--Father Abraham stood up  
and replied. &quot;If you would have my ad­  
ice, I will give it to you in short, &quot;for a  
word to the wise is enough,&quot; as Poor Rich­  
ard says. They joined in desiring him to  
peak his mind, and gathering round him  
he proceeded as follows:  
&quot;Friends,&quot; says he, &quot;the taxes are, in­  
deed very heavy, and if those laid on by  
the Government were the only ones we had  
to pay, we might more easily discharge  
thein; but we have many others, and much  
more grievous to some of us. We are tax­  
ed twice as much by our idleness, three  
times as much by our pride, and four time  
as much by our folly; and from these taxes  
the commissioners cannot ease or deliver  
us, by allowing an abatement. However,  
let us hearken to good advice, and som­  
thing may be done for us, &quot;God helps them  
that help themselves,&quot; as Poor Richard  
says.  
&quot;1. It would be thought a hard govern­  
ment that should tax its people one tenth  
part of their time, to be empioyed in itsser  
but idleness taxes many of us much  
more; sloth, by bringing on diseases, abso­  
lutely shortens life. &quot;Sloth, like rust con­  
sumes faster than labor wears, while the  
used key is always bright, as Poor Richard  
says. &quot;But dost thou love life, then do not  
squander time, for that is the stuff life is  
made of,&quot; as Poor Richard says. How  
much more than is necessary do we spend  
in sleep! forgetting that &quot;the sleeping lox  
catches no poultry, and that there will be  
sleeping enough in the grave,&quot; as Poor  
Richard says.  
&quot;If time be of all things the most pre-  
cious, wasting time must be,&quot; as Poor Rich  
ard says, &quot;the greatest prodigality,&quot; since,  
as he elsewhere teils us, &quot;lost time is never  
found again; and what we call time enough  
always proves little enough;&quot; let us then up  
and be doing, and doing to the purpose; so  
by diligence shall we do more with less per­  
plexity. &quot;Sloth makes all things difficult,  
but industry all easy; and he that riseth late  
must trot all day and and scarce overtake  
his business at night; while laziness travels  
so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him,  
Drive thy business, let not that drive thee,  
and early to bed and early to rise, makes a  
man healthy, wealthy, and wise,&quot; as Poor  
Richard says.  
&quot;So what signifies, wishing and hoping  
for better times? We may make these  
times better if we bestir ourselves. &#x27;Indus­  
try need not wish, and he that lives upon  
hope will die fasting. There are no gains  
theittt watitst thor hole hands for I have  
ot pals, then beil hats tt u  
no lands,&#x27; or, if I have, they are smartly  
taxed. &quot;He, that hath a trade, hath an estate;  
and he that hath a calling, hath an office of  
profit and honor,&#x27; as Poor Richard says;  
but then the trade must be worked at, and  
the calling well followed, or neither the  
estate nor the office will enable us to pay  
our taxes. If we are industrious, we shall  
never starve; for, &#x27;at the working man&#x27;s  
house, hunger looks in, but dares not en­  
ter.&quot; Nor will the bailiff or the constable  
enter, for industry pays debts, while de­  
spanf increaseth them.&quot; What though you  
have found no treasure, nor has any rich re­  
lation left you a legacy, &#x27;diligency is the  
mother of good luck, and God gives all  
things to industry. Then plough deep while  
Sluggards&#x27;sleep, and you shall have corn to  
sell and to keep.&quot; Work while it is called  
to-day, for you know not how much you  
may be hindered to-morrow. &quot;One to-day  
is worth two to-morrows,&quot; as poor Richard  
says; and farther, &quot;never leave that till to  
  
morrow, which you can do to-day. If you  
were a servant, would you not be ashamed  
that a good master should catch you idle?  
Are you then your own master? Be asham­  
ed to catch yourself idle, when there is so  
much to be done for yourself, your family,  
your country and your king. Handle your  
tools without mittens; remember, that &quot;the  
cat in gloves catches no mice, as Poor  
Richard says. It is true, there is much to  
be done and perhaps you are weak handed;  
but stick to it steadily, and you will see  
great effects, for &quot;constant dropping wears  
away stones; and by diligence and patience  
the mouse ate in two the cable; and little  
strokes fell great oaks.&quot;  
  
&quot;Methinks I hear some of you say, &#x27;must  
not a man afford himself any leisure?&quot; I  
will tell thee, my friend, what Poor Rich­  
ard says; &#x27;employ thy time well, if thou  
meanest to gain leisure; and since thou art  
not sure of a minute, throw not away an  
hour.&quot; Leisure is time for doing something  
useful; this leisure the diligent man will  
obtain, but lazy men never; for a life of  
leisure and a life of laziness are two things  
lany, without labor, would live by their  
wits only, but they break for want of stock;&quot;  
whereas industry gives comfort, plenty, and  
respect. &quot;Fly pleasures, and they will fol  
 e e e e o  e  
  
eee e e e a e  eeitor yon wi be in fear when yo speak to  
shift; and now I have a sheep and cow, him when yon will make poor, pitiful,  
every one bids me good morrow.eking excuses and by degrees come to  
&quot;H. But with our industry we must like lose your veracity, and sink into base down­  
wise be steady, settled, and careful, and right lying; for,  the second vice is lying;  
oversee our own affairs with our own eves e e e a i e a o ie  
  
and not trust  
too much to others; for as  
Poor Richard says.  
&quot;I never saw an oft removed tree  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.  
And again, &#x27;three removes is as bad as a  
fire;&quot; and again, &#x27;keep thy shop, and thy  
shop will keep thee;&quot; and again, &#x27;if you  
would have your business done, go, if not  
send.&quot; And again,  
&quot;He that hy the plough would thrive,  
Htinself must either hold or drive.&quot;  
And again, &#x27;the eye of a master will do  
more work than both his hands; and again,  
&#x27;want of care does us more damage than  
want of knowledge; and again, tnot to  
oversee workmen, is to leave them your  
purse open.&#x27; Trusting too much to others&#x27;  
care is the ruin of many; for, &#x27;in the affairs  
of this world, men are saved, not by faith  
but by the want of it?&#x27; but a man&#x27;s own care  
is profitable; for, &quot;if you would have a faith­  
ful servant, and one that you like, serve  
yourself. A little neglect may breed great  
mischief; for want of a nail the shoe was  
lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost,  
and for want of a horse the rider was lost,&quot;  
being overtaken and slain by the enemy; all  
for want of a little care about a horse-shoe  
nail.  
&quot;HI. So much for industry, my friends,  
and attention to one&#x27;s business; but to these  
we must add frugality, if we would make  
our industry more certainly successful. A  
man may, if he knows not how to save as  
he gets, &quot;keep his nose all his life to the  
grindstone  
last. A ta

&quot;Away then, with your expensive fol­  
lies, and you will not then have so much  
cause to complain of hard times, heavy  
taxes, and chargeable families; for  
&quot;Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth small, and the want great.&quot;  
And farther, &quot;what maintains one vice would  
bring up two children.&quot; You may think,  
perhaps that a little tea or a little punch,  
now and then, dict a little more costly,  
clothes a little finer, and a little entertain­  
ment now and then, can be no great matter;  
but remember, &quot;many a little makes a  
mickle.&quot; Beware of little expenses; &quot;a small  
leak will sink a great ship,&quot; as poor Richard  
says; and again, &#x27;who dainties love shall  
beggars prove,&quot; and moreover, &quot;fools make  
feasts, and wise men eat them.&quot;  
&quot;Here you are all got together to this  
sale of fineries and nick-nacks. You call  
them goods, but if you do not take care,  
they will prove evils, to some of you. You  
expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps  
they may, for less than they cost; but, if  
you have no occasion for them, they must  
be dear  
to you. Kemember what l&#x27;oor  
Richard says, &quot;buy what thou hast no need  
of, and ere long thou shalt sell they neces­  
saries.&quot; And again, &quot;at a great pennyworth  
pause awhile.&quot; He means that perhaps the  
cheapness is apparent only, and not real; or  
the bargain by straitening thee in thy busi­  
ness, may do thee more harm than good.

ries of life ther can searely be called thee to we t o on a ite onger e  
  
conveniencies; and yet, only because they  
o oe eee e eee e eeeeee e  
0 tfety  thy whht10 hate thit  
By these and other extravagencies, the gen­  
teel are reduced to poverty, and forced to  
borrow of those whom they formerly de  
spised, but who, through industry and fru  
gality, have maintained their standing; in  
which case it appears plainly, that &#x27;a plough-  
man on his legs is higher than a gentieman  
on his knees,&quot; as poor Richard says. Per-  
haps they have had a small estate left them  
which they knew not the getting of; they  
think &#x27;it is day, and it will never be night;  
that a little to be spent out of so much is  
not worth minding; but &#x27;always taking out  
of the meal-tub, and never putting in, soon  
comes to the bottom,&quot; as poor Richard says,  
and then, &quot;when the well is dry, they know  
the worth of water.&quot; But this they might  
have known before, if they had taken his  
advice: &quot;if you would know the value of  
money go and try to borrw some; for he  
that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing, &#x27;as  
poor Richard says; and indeed so does he  
that lends to such people, when be goes to  
get it again. Poor Dick father advises, and  
says,  
Fond pride of dress is sure a curss,  
Bre sancy you consult, consult your purse.&quot;  
And again, &quot;pride is as loud a beggar as  
  
want, and a great deal more saucy.&quot; When  
you have bought one fine thing, you must  
buy ten more, that your appearance may be  
all of a piece; but poor Dick says, &#x27;it is  
easier to suppress the first desire than to  
satisfy all that follow it; and it is truly fol­  
ly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the  
frog to swell in order to equal the ox.  
Vessels large may venture more.  
But little boats should keep near shore.&quot;  
It is, however, a folly soon punished; for, as  
poor Richard says, &quot;pride that dines on  
  
vanity, sups on contempt; pride breakfast  
ed with plenty, dined with poverty, and sup  
ped with infamy.&quot; And, after all, of what  
use is the pride of appearance, for which so  
much is risked, so much suffered? It cane  
not promote health, nor ease pain; it makes  
no increase of merit in the person; it creates  
envy, it hastens misfortune.  
&quot;But what madness must it be to ran i  
debt for these superfluities! We are offer-  
ed by the terms of this sale six months cred­  
it; and that perhaps has induced some of  
us to attend it, because we cannot spare the  
roady money and hone now to be fine with-  
out it. But ah! think what you do when  
run in debt; you give to another power  
f your liberty. If you cannot pay at the  
lime, you will be ashamed to see your cred  
ee eeeee eeeee  e e  
 ft  ti y  
to the same puthiise  
ard says  
 o oooo oooe e  
&quot;lying rides upon debt&#x27;s back,&quot; whereas a  
free-born Englishman ought not to be asha­  
med nor afraid to see or speak to any man  
living. But poverty often deprives a man  
of all spirit and virtue. &quot;It is hard for an  
empty bag to stand upright. What would  
you think of that prince, or of that govern  
ment, who should issue an edict forbidding  
you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewo  
man on pain of imprisonment or servitude!  
Would you not say, that you were free, have  
a right to dress as you please, and that such  
an edict would be a breach of your privil­  
eges, and such a government tyrannical?  
And yet you are about to put yourself under  
that tyranny, when you run in debt for such  
dress! your creditor has authority, at his  
pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty, by  
confining you in jail for life, or by selling  
you for a servant, if you should not be able  
to pay him. When you have got your bar­  
gain, you may perhaps, think little of pa­  
ment; but, as poor Richard says, &quot;credit­  
ors have better memories than debtors; cred­  
itors are a superstitious sect, great observ  
ers of set-days and times.&quot; The day comes  
round before you are aware, and the demand  
is made before you are prepared to satisly  
it; or, if you bear your debt in mind, the  
term which at first seemed so long, will as  
it lessens appear extremely short; time will  
seem to have added wings to his heels as  
well as to his shoulders. &quot;Those have a  
short Lent, who owe money to be paid at  
Easter.&quot; At present, perhaps, you may think  
ourselves in thriving circumstances, and  
hral yof  
ut i!  
can bear  
little extravagance with-  
ry butooo  
want save while you may,  
norning sun lasts a whole day.&quot;   
ty be temporary and uncertain, but  
hile you live, expense is constant and  
and, &quot;it is easier to build two chim-  
Gain   
ef,  
certalll  
neys th  
ard say  
  
seep one in fuel,&quot; as poor ich­  
rather go to bed supperless  
than  
rise in debt.  
Get what you can and what you get hold,  
Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold.&quot;  
And when you have got the philosopher&#x27;s  
stone, sure you will no longer complain of  
bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.  
&quot;1V. This doctrine, my friends, is rea­  
son and wisdom; but after all, do not de­  
pend too much upon your own industry, and  
frugality, and prudence, though excellent  
things; for they may all be blasted, without  
the blessing of Heaven; and therefore ask  
that blessing humbly, and be not uncharita­  
ble to those that at present seem to want it,  
but comfort and help them. Remember Job  
suffered, and afterwards was prosperous.  
And now, to conclude, &quot;Experience­  
keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in  
no other,&#x27; as poor Richard says, and scarce  
in that; for it is true, &quot;we may give advice,  
but we cannot give conduct;&#x27; however, re-  
member this, &quot;they that will not be counsel-  
ed cannot be helped;&quot; and farther, that &quot;If  
you will not hear reason she will surely rap  
your knuckles,&quot; as poor Richard says  
ur knuckles, as poof wlchard says-  
Thus the old gentleman ended his har  
angue. The people heard it and approved  
the doctrine; and immediately practiced the  
contrary, just as if it had been a common  
sermon, for the auction opened, and they  
began to buy extravagantly. I found the  
good man had thoroughly studied my alma­  
nacks, and digested all I had dropt on those  
topies during the course of twenty-live veals.

The way to Wealth.  
CouitTF.ous Ukadkii: I have heard that  
notliing gives an author , so great pleasure  
as ti tiud hi works respectfully quoted by  
  
others. Judge then, how much I must  
  
have been gratified by an incident I am go  
  
ing to relate to yov,. 1 stopped my horse  
lately where a great number of people were  
collected at an auction of merchant&#x27;s&#x27; goods.  
Tho hour of the salo not being come, they  
were conversing on the badness of the times;  
and ono of tho company called to a plain,  
clean old man, with whito locks &quot;Pray,  
father Abraham, what think yoa of the  
times? Will not theso heavy taxes quite  
ruin the country ? How shall wo ever be  
able to pay them ? What would you ad­  
vise us to V Father Abraham stood up  
and replied, &#x27; If you would have my ad­  
vice, I will give it you in short; for, a  
word to the wise is enough, as poor Richard  
nays.&quot; They joined in desiring him to  
.vpeak his mini, and gathering arouud him,  
ho proceeded as follows :  
&quot; Friends,&quot; says he, &quot; the taxes are in  
  
deed very heavy, and if those laid on by  
tho government were tho only ones we had  
  
to pay, wo might more easily discharge  
them; but wo have many others, and much  
moro grievous to some of us. We are tax­  
ed twice as much by pur idleness, three  
times as much by our pride, and four times  
as much by our folly, and from these taxes  
tho commissioners cannot case or deliver  
us, by allowing an abatement. However, let  
nray&#x27;PiVrjue iui &quot;17 VTTocr&quot;Tie&#x27;Ips&#x27;Ttie uT  
that helps themselves, as poor Ttichard says.  
I. It would be thought a hard govern­  
ment that should Ux its people one tenth  
of their time, to be employed in its service ;  
but idleness taxes many of us much more.  
Sloth, by bringing cn diseases, absolutely  
shortens life. Sloth, liko rust, consumes  
faster than labor wears ; while the useel key  
is always bright, as poor llichard says.  
But do.st thou love life and then do not  
squander time, for that is the stuff life is  
made of, as poor llichard says. How much  
more than is necessary do we spend in  
sleep, forgetting that the sleeping fox catch  
  
es no poultry, an 1 that there will be sleep­  
ing enough in the grave, a3 poor llichard  
says.  
&quot; If timo be of all things the most pre­  
cious, wasting time must be, as poor llich­  
ard says, tho greatest prodigality ; since, as  
ho elsewhere tells us, lost time is never  
found again; and what wo call time enough,  
always proves little enough. Lot us then  
up and be doing, and doing to tho purpose;  
fl -, by diligence, shall we do more with less  
perplexity. Sloth makes all things difficult,  
but industry all easy ; and ho that riscth  
late must trot all day, and shall scarcely  
overtake his business at night; while lazi­  
ness travels so slowly that poverty soon  
  
overtakes him. Drive thy business, let not  
that drive thee : aud early to bed and early  
  
to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and  
  
wise, as poor Kichard says.  
  
&quot; So, what signifies wishing and hoping  
fir better times ? Wo may make these  
  
times better, if we bestir, ourselves. In  
dustry need not wish ; and he that lives u

tell thee, my.,. friend, what rpoor Richard  
says :K.mploy thy time well, if thou mean­  
est to gain leisure ; and since thou art not  
fcure of a minute, throw not away an hour;  
Leisure is time for doing something useful.  
This leisure the diligent man will obtain,  
but the lazy man never ; for a life of leis­  
ure and a life of laziness are too things.-1  
many without- labor, would live by their  
  
wits only, but they breafc tor w.ant ot stock ;  
whereas, industry gives comfort, and plen­  
ty, and respect. . Fly pleasures, and they  
will follow jou. - The diligent spinner has  
a largo shift; and now I have a sheep and  
a cow, every body bids me good-morrow  
&#x27;II. But with our industry we must  
likewise be steady, settled, and careful ;  
  
and oversee ouf own affairs with our &quot;own  
  
eyes, and not trust too much to others ; for  
  
as poor Richard says  
. I never saw an oft removed tree  
Nor yet an oft removed family,  
Jhat throve eo well as those that settled he.  
  
And again, three removes are as bad . as  
  
a fire ; and again, keep thy shop, and thy  
  
shop will keep. thee&quot;; and again, if you  
would have your business done, go ; if not,  
send ; and again . .

And again, the eye of a master will do  
moro work than both his hands ; and again,  
want of care does us more harm than a

is the ruin of many ; for in the affairs of  
  
this world, men are saved, not by taith, but  
by the want of it ; but a man&#x27;s own care is  
profitable ; for if you would have a faith­

yourself ; a little neglect may breed great  
mischief; for want of a nail the shoe was

that perhaps the cheapness is apparent  
only, and not real; or the bargain, by  
  
straitening thee in thy business, may do  
thee more harm than good. For in another  
place he says, &#x27; many have been ruined by

If you would know the value of money,  
go and try to borrow some; for he that goes  
a borrowing goes a sorrowing, as Poor  
Richard soys; and, indeed, so does he that  
lends to such people, when he goes to get  
it again. Poor Dick further advises, and  
says  
&quot;Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse;  
Ere fabrie you consult, consult your purse.  
And again, &quot;Pride is as loud a beggar  
as want, and a great deal more saucy.&quot;  
When you have bought one fine thing, you  
must buy ten more, that your appearence  
may all be of a piece; but poor Dick says,  
&quot;It is easier to suppress the first desire,  
than to satisfy all that follow it.&quot; And it  
it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the  
rich, as for the frog to swell in order to o­  
qual the ox.  
&quot;Vessels large may venture more,  
But little boats should keep near shore.  
It is, however, a folly soon punished:  
for, as Poor Richard says, &quot;Pride that dines  
on vanity, sups on contempt; Pride break­  
fasted with Plenty, dined with Poverty, and  
supped with infamy.&quot; And after all, of  
what use is this pride of appearance, for  
which so much is risked, so much is suf­  
fered? It cannot promote health, or ease  
pain: it makes no increase of merit in the  
person, it creates envy, it hastens misfor­  
tune.  
But what madness it must be to run in  
debt for these superfluities! We are offer­  
ed by the terms of this sale, six months  
credit; and that perhaps, has induced some.  
of us to attend it, because we cannot spare  
the ready money, and hope to be fine with­  
out it. But ah! think what you do when  
you run in debt; you give to another pow  
er over your liberty. If you cannot pay  
at the time, you will be ashamed to see  
your creator; you speak to him; you will  
make poor, pitiful sneaking excuses, and,  
by degrees, come to lose your veracity, and  
sink into base, downright lying; for, &quot;the  
second vice is lying, the first is running  
in debt,&quot; as Poor Richard says; and again,  
to the same purpose, &quot;lying rides upon  
debt&#x27;s back; whereas a freeborn English­  
man ought not to be ashamed or afraid to  
see or speak to any man living. But pov­

virtue. &quot;It is hard for an empty bag to

proves little enough. Let us then up and  
be doing, and doing to the purpose; so  
by diligence shall we do more with less  
perplexity. Sloth makes all things disli-­  
cult, but Industry all easy; and he that  
riseth late must trot all day, and shall  
scarco overtake his business at night  
while laziness travels so slowly, that poy-­  
erty soon overtakes him. Drive thy busr-­  
ness, let not that drive thee; and earlyt  
bed, and early to rise, makes a man hea  
thy wealthy, and wise.

PRELIMINARY ADDRESS  
To the Pennsylvania Almanac, entitled  
“Toor Richard&#x27;s Almanac, Jor 1758.”  
BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.  
I have heard that nothing gives an author  
  
sn great pleasure ns to nml his works respect­  
fully quoted by other learned authors, This  
pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for though 1  
have beeu, if I may say it without vanity, au  
eminent author (ot Almanacs) annually now  
a full quarter of a ceutury, my brother au­  
thors iu the same way (for wlint reason I  
know not) have ever been sparing iri their ap­  
plauses; aud no other author lias taken the  
least notice of me; so that, did not my wri­  
tings produce me some solid pudding, the  
great defieieuty of praise would have quite  
discouraged me.  
I concluded, at length, that the people were  
the best judges of my merit, for they buy my  
works; and besides, in my rambles, where I  
jam not personally known, I have frequently  
heard one or other of my adages repeated,  
wilh “ as poor Richard says,&quot; at tnc end o’nt.  
This gave me some satisfaction, as it showed  
not only that my instructions were regarded,  
but discovered likewise some respect for my  
authority; and I own that to encourage the  
practice of remembering and repeatiug those  
wise sentences, I have sometimes quoted my­  
self with gravity.  
Judge then how mueh I have been gratified  
by an incident which I am going to relate tc  
you, I stopped my horse lately where a  
great many people were collected at an auc­  
tion of merchants’ goods. The hour of sale  
not beiug come, they were conversing on the  
badness of the times; and one of the company  
called to a plain, clean, old man; with white  
locks, “ Pray, father Abraham, what think  
ye of the times? Won’t these fieavy taxei  
quite ruiu the country? How shall we evn  
be able to pay them? What would you ad  
vise us to? ’ bather Abraham stood up, and  
replied,If you have my advise, I’ll give 1  
to you iu short; “ for a word to the wise ii  
ensugb; and many words wont fill a bushel,  
»8 poor Richard says.” They joined in de  
siring him to speak his mind; and, gathering  
round him, bo proceeded as follows:  
  
I “ Friends (says be) and neighbors, the tax­  
[es are indeed very heavy; and if those laid  
: on by the goverment were the only ones we  
I had to pay, we might more easily discharge  
them: hut we have many others, and much  
more previous to some of us. We are tux&#x27;tl  
twice as much by our idleness, three times as  
much by our pride, and four times as much  
by our folly; and from those taxes the c&lt;&gt;m­  
, mis-intiors canuot case or deliver us, bv allow­  
ing an abatement. However let us hearken  
to good advice, and something may be done  
: f( r us; 1 God helps thftn that helps them­  
selves,’ as poor Richard says in his Alma­  
nac.  
“ ft would be thought a hard government  
that should tax its people one-teuth part of  
! their time, to bo employed in its services; but  
j idleness taxes many of us much more, if we  
j reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth, or  
| doing of nothing, with that, which is spent in  
j idle employments, or amusements that amount  
i to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on diseases,  
; absolutely shortens life. ‘ Sloth, like rust,  
j consumes faster than labour wears, while the  
. ki y often used is always bright,’ as poor  
i Richard says. ‘ Hut dost thou love life? tin n  
do not squander time, for that’s the stuff life  
is made of,’ as poor Richard says. ‘ IIow  
j much more than is necessary do we spend in  
I sleep! forgetting, that ‘ the sleeping fox CBtch­  
! cs uo poultry, aud that there will be sleep­  
ing enough iu the grave,’as poor Richard  
j.-ays. * Jf time be of all things the most pre­  
cious, wasting time must be (as poor Rich­  
ard says) the greatest prodigality;’ since, as  
lie cist whore tells us, • Lost, time is never  
found again; and what wo vail time enough,  
! always proves little enough.’ Lot us then  
up and bo doing, and doing to the purpose;  
so by diligence shall wade more with less  
j perplexity. ‘ SI’ tli makes a!J things difficult,  
hut industry all easy,’ as poor Richard says;  
! and ‘ he that riselh late must trot till day,  
| and shall scarce overtake his business at  
| night; while laziness travels so slowly, that  
j pevt-rty soon overtakes him,’ as we read in  
poor Richard; who adds, ‘Drive thy business&#x27;,  
; let not that drivo thee;’ and,  
Early to bed, and early to rise,  
| Makes a man healthy, wealth, r.r.d wise.

c - - Q-- - jC O­  
! better tioiCM We make* these times better  
i! wc In stir ourselves. ‘Industry needs nut  
; wish, as poor llichard says: ‘ lie that lives  
upon hope will die lasting.’ ‘There are no  
I go:ns without pains; then help hands, for 1  
have no lands;’ aud, (as poor llichard like­  
wise observes.) ‘ He that hath a trade hath  
: an estate, and tie that hath a calling hath an  
, office of profit and honor;’ hut thou the trade  
j must he wot lieu at. aud the calling well fol­  
lowed, Or toother vUeo’d&#x27;ate or the office will  
enable us to pay our taxes. If we are iu­  
dusurious wc shall never starve; for a3 poor  
j llichard says, ‘ At the working man’s house  
j hunger looks in, but dares not enter.’ Nor  
; will the bailnf or the eodstablc enter; for  
1 ludustry pays dents, hut despair increaseth  
them,’ says poor llichard. What though  
: you have found no treasure, nor has any rich  
relation left you a legacy? ‘ Diligence is the  
j mother of good luck,’ as poor llichard say’s:  
&#x27; and ‘ Hod gives all tilings to industry; then  
plough deep while sluggards sleep, and you  
i will have corn to sell aud to keep,’ says poor  
. Dick. Work while it is called to-day; for  
you know not how much you may be bin­  
j dered to-morrow; which makes poor llichard  
Isay, ‘One to-day is worth two to-morrowV;  
and, farther, ‘ Have you somewhat to do to­  
morrow, do it to-day.’ ‘ If you were a ser­  
: vaut, would you not. he ashamed that a good  
j master should catch you idle? Are you theu  
: your own master, be ashamed to catch your­  
j self idle, as pour Dick says. When there is  
j so much to bo doue for yourself, your family,  
j and your gracious kiug, be up by peep of  
day: ‘ Li t riot the sun look down, and say,  
j ‘luglorius here he lies!’ Handle your tools  
| wittiuut mittens; remember, ‘ that the cat in  
gloves catches no iriice,’ us poor Dick says. It  
is true, there is much to bo douc, and perhaps  
you are weak-handed; but stick to it steadily,  
and you will see great effects; for, contiuual  
diuppiug wears away stones, aud by diligence  
aud patience tiie mouse ate iuto the cable:  
and light strokes fell great osks,’ as poor  
llichard says in his Almanac, the year 1 can­  
  
iici* just now ruuiumuer.  
“ .Metliinks I hear some, of you say, ‘ must  
a man afford himself no leisure?’ 1 will tell  
(hoc, my friend, what poor Rickard says;  
‘ Employ thy time well, if thou meunst to  
gain leisure; and since thou art not sure of a  
minute, throw not away au hour.’ Leisure  
is time for doing something useful; this lei­  
sure the diligent man will ohtaiu, hut the lazy  
man uever; so that, as poor Richard says, ‘A  
life of leisure and a life of laziness are two  
things.&#x27; Do you imagine that sloth will af­  
ford you more comfort than labor? No; for,  
as poor Richard says. ‘Troubles spring from  
idleness, and grevious toils from needless  
east: many without labor would live by their  
own wits only; but they break for wuut of  
stock.’ Wbcras industry gives comfort, aud  
plenty, and respect. ‘ Fiy pleasures, aud  
they’ll follow you; the diligent spinner has a  
large shift,.and, now I have a sheep and a  
. cow, everybody bids me good-morrow;’ all  
which is wall said by poor Richard,  
“But with our industry, wo must likewise  
be steady, aud settled, aud careful, and over­  
see our own affairs with our own eyes, aud  
not trust too much to others; for, as poor  
Richard say?,  
‘I never saw an oft-vemoved tree,  
Nor yet au oft removed family,  
That throve so well as one that settled be.’  
“ And again, ‘ Three removes are as bad  
as a fife: and again, ‘ Keep thy shop, and  
thy shop will keep thee;’ aud again, ‘If you  
would have your business done, go; if not,  
send.’ And again.  
‘lie that by the plow would thrive  
Himself must cither hold or drive.*  
And again, ‘ The&quot;eye of the master will do  
I more work than both his hands;’ and again,  
‘ Want of care does us more damage than  
want of knowledge;’ and again, ‘ £iot to over­  
see workmen is to leave them your purse  
open.’ Trusting too much toother’s care is  
the ruin of many; for, os the Almauuc says,  
‘ In the affairs of the world, men are saved  
not by faith, but by the want of it; but a  
mau’3 own care is profitable; for, saith poor  
  
Dick, ‘ Learning is to tne studious, and rich­  
es to the careful, as well ns power to the  
bold, and Leaven to the virtuous. And, fur­  
ther, ‘ If you would have a faithful servant,  
and ont that you like, serve yourself.’ And  
i again, heauviseth to circumspection and cure,  
! even in the smallest matters, because some­  
times, ‘ A little neglect may breed great mis­  
chief; adding, ‘ l’er want of a nail the shoe  
was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost;  
and’for want of a horse the rider was lost,  
being overtaken an 1 slain by the enemy, all  
for want of care about a horse-shoe nail.  
“ So much f«r industry, niy friends, and  
attention to one’s own business; but to these  
we must add frugality, if we would make our  
industry more certainly, successful. A man  
i may, if he knows nut how to save as he gets,  
I ‘keep his nose all bis life to the grindstone,  
and die not worth a groat at last.’ ‘ A fat  
kitchen makes a lean will,’ as poor Itichard  
says: and,  
‘Many estates are spent in the getting;  
Since women fur lea forsook spinning aud knit­  
ting,  
-4nd men for punch for »rk hewing and splitting.  
“If you would be wealthy, (says be, in  
another Almanac) think of saving as well a;  
of getting; the Indies have not made Spain  
ricb, because her out goes are greater tbau  
1 her incomes.’  
‘ Away then with your expansive folios,  
! and you will not have much cause to &lt;  
; plain of bard times, heavy faxes, and ehatge­  
j able families; f r. as poor Dick says,  
‘Women mul ■wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth small, and the want great.’  
“ And, farther, ‘ What maintainsona-.vice,  
! would bring up two children.’ You may  
j think, pol,ups, that a little ton, or a little  
1 punch now and then, diet a little more cost­  
ly, clothes a little liner, and a little entertain­  
ment how and then, can be no great matter;  
| but remember what poor Richard says, ‘ ?da­  
t.y a little makes a miek&#x27;e;’ and fart hi r, ‘ Re­  
ware of little expenses; a small leak will  
j sink a great ship;’and again, ‘Who dain­  
| ties love, shall beggars prove;’ and more,  
over, ‘ rods make feasts, aud wise men cat  
them.’  
“Here vet: are all c-ot together .of this s«%  
  
I of fineries and nick-nacks. You rail them  
; goods; hut if you do not take care, they will  
prove evils to some of von. You expect tin y  
will he sold cheap, ami perhaps they may 1. ;■  
less than cent; but it you have no occasion  
i for them, they must he dear to you. Re­  
; member what poor Richard says, ‘Buy what  
thou hast no need e.f, and ere long tluiu shall  
I sell thy ncees-aries.’ And ttg-tin, ‘At a:  
| jjri-at penny worth pause awhile.’ He nt-atis  
J that perhaps the cheapness is epj arent ottlv.  
; or not real; er the bargain, by straitening  
; i hoc in thy business, may do thee more harm  
j than good. For in another place lie savs,  
i ‘-Many have been ruined by buying good pen*  
■ uyswarths.’ Again, as poor Richard says,  
j ‘It. is foolish to lay out money in a purchase  
i of repentance; and yet this fully is practised  
every day at auctions,for waut of minding the  
Almanac. ‘Wise melt (as pior J &gt;iek stays)  
learn by other’s harms, fools scarcely by their  
own; hut F/:.v qnam Jaa&#x27;uiit ctlinna prri­  
culx cuutum.’ .Many a one, for the sake of  
finery on the back, have gone with a hungry  
belly, and half starved their families: ‘Silk  
• and satins, scarlet and velvets, (as poor Rich­  
ard says) put out the kitchen fire.’ These  
are not the necessaries of lift ; they can scarce­  
ly be call&#x27; d the courunicnciesj and yet only  
because they look pretty, how many want to  
have them? The artificial wants of mankind  
thus become more numerous than the natural  
and as poor D:ek says, ‘For one person there  
sre a hundred indigent.’ By these and other  
extravagances the genteel arc reduced to  
poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom  
they formerly despise, but who, through in­  
dustry and frugality, have maintained their  
standing; in which case, it appears plainly.  
‘A ploughman on his legs is higher than a  
gentleman on his knees,’ as poor Richard  
says. Perhaps they have had a small estate  
left them, which they knew not the getting  
of; they think, ‘It is day, and will never be  
night;—that a little to be spent out of so  
much, is not worth minding, ‘A child and a  
fool (as poor Richard Says) imagine twenty  
shillings and twenty years can never be sp^ut;  
but always he taking out of the meal tub,  
  
ami never be putting in, soon comes to the  
i bottom;’ tu n, us poor Dick says, ‘When the  
I well is dry they know the worth of water.’  
] Hut tbis they might havo known before, if  
! they had taken his advise: ‘if you would  
■ know the Value of money, go and try to bor­  
row some; for lie tiiat goes &quot;a borrowing goes  
a sorrowing; and indeed, so does lie that lends  
to such people, when tie goes to get it again.’  
Poor Dick farther advises, and says.  
‘Fond pride of dress is sure a very-curse:  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.’  
* Aud again, ‘Pride is ns loud a beggar as  
} Want, and a great deal more saucy.’ Wbeu  
| you have bought one tine thing you must buy  
: ten more, that your appearance may be al! of  
a-piece; but poor Dick says, ‘it is easier to  
suppress the first desire, titan to satisfy all  
that follow it.’ And it is as truly folly for  
the poor to ape the rich, as the frog to swell,  
in order to c-tjual the ox.  
Vessels large may venture more,  
But little boats should keep near shore.’  
&#x27;Tin, however, a folly soon punished; for,  
‘ Pride that dines on vanity, sups on cou­  
tempt,’ as poor Diehard says. And in another  
place, ‘Pride breakfasted with Plenty, dined  
with Poverty, and supped with Infamy.’—  
And, after all, of what use is the pride of ap­  
pearance, for which so much is risked, so  
much is suffered? It cannot promote health,  
or case pain, it makes no increase of merit in  
the person; it hastens misfortune.  
‘ What is a butterfly? at best,  
He’S but a oatterpillar drest;  
The gaudy fop&#x27;s bis picture just,’  
as poor Diehard says  
“ But what niadness&#x27;must it be to run in  
debt for these superfluities! We are offered  
by the terms of this sal# six months’ credit,  
aud that perhaps has induced some of us to  
attend it, beouuso wo cuuuot spare the ready  
rnouey, aud hope now to be fine without it.—  
But, ah, think what you do when you ruu in  
debt. You give to another power over your  
liberty. If you cauuot pay at the time, you  
will be ashamed to see your creditor; you  
  
j will be in fear when you speak to him; you I  
. wifi tnakc poor, pitiful, /ntakiDg erensos, and j  
j degrees come to lose your verueitv, and  
■ sink into base downright lying; for, as poor |  
I lliehanj fays, ‘The second vice is lying; the j  
| first is running in debt.’ And again, to the i  
; fame purpose, * Lying rides up- n debt’s back;’ ;  
whereas a free-born Englishman ouvbt not  
! to be ashamed nor afraid to speak to any n.r.n  
j.living. Lot poverty often deprive- a man a!  
, all spirit and virtue: ‘ It is bar.: for or; empty

; his plea-ure, to deprive you of your liberty,  
j by confining] you in jail f.»r life,01 by selling :  
! you for u servant, if you should n t ho abb |  
j to pay him. When you have g t y ; r bar­  
| gain, you may, perhaps, think little of pay- 1  
j incur; but ‘ Creditors&#x27; (poor i’i chard t. in u-j |  
i have better mem. rie. than d- I&#x27;ors;’ and in j  
; another place he say?, ‘ Creditors are a supc r­  
■ sfi&#x27;ious feet, great olv-rrvcrs of ret days and  
times.’ The day conies round before ycu n-o  
aware, and the demand is -tirade before you  
are prepared to satisfy it. Or if you bear  
| your debt ia mind, the term wLieb at tu.-t

; u u 1/  
1 Fi.r age and want save while y a r.ivv,  
No ra: ruing run 1 ts a whole day/  
as poor Richard savs. Gaiu may Le temper- ;  
ary and unetrta.ii: but ever while v u live, j  
expense is con.-ta-it and certain; ar,J ‘ it is  
easier to build two chimneys, than to ’o ip  
one in fuel,’ as poor Richard say s. So *Rutu­  
er go to bed supperksM than rise in debt.’  
‘ Get what you can, and what you get liohi,  
’1&#x27;is the stem* that will turn nil your lea 1 into geld,’  
as poor Richard says. And when you have  
got the philosopher&#x27;s si nr, aura you will no  
longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty  
of paying t txes.  
This doctrine, my friends, is reassn &#x27; and  
wisdom; but, after-ail, donut depend too much  
upon your own industry, and frugality, and  
prudence though cxcelieut thing-; f r they ,  
may be blasted without the blessing of lleav- j  
en; and therefore ask taut blessing humbly, !  
aud be not uncharitable to those that at pres- I  
cut seem to want it, but comfort and -help j  
them. Kememlvr Job suffered, and was af­  
terwards prosperous.  
“ And now, to conclude, ‘ Experience kaeps  
a dear school; but fouls will learn in no other,  
and scarce in that; for it is true, we may  
give advice, but wo emmet give conduct,’ as  
poor Richard says. However, remember this.  
‘ They that will not be counselled, cannot be  
helped,’ as poor Richard says; and further,  
that ‘ If you will not hear Reason, she will  
surely rap your knuckles.’  
Thus the old gentleman ended his bar­  
rangue. The people heard it aud approved  
the doctrine, and immediately practised the  
contrary, just as if is had been a common ser­  
mon, fur t-he auction opened, and they began  
to buy extravagantly, notwithstanding all  
his cautions, aud their now f ar of taxes. I  
found the good man had thoroughly studi o] ;  
my Almanacs, and digested all i had’droppetl !  
on these topics, during the course of f.vuty- ;  
five years. The frequent mention he made  
of me, must have tired every one els.; but my j  
vanity was wonderfully delighted with it. !  
though I was conscious that not a tenth pail i  
of the wisdom was my own, which he ascribed |  
to me, but rather the gleanings that i hud 1  
made of the sense of all ag-&#x27;s and nations.—  
  
However, I resolved to bo the better for the  
echo of it, and though I had first ‘detirmim d j  
to buy stuff for a new coat, I went away, re­  
solved to wear uiv old one a little longer.—  
Header, if thou wilt do the same thy profit ;  
will be great as mine.

Pooii RICHARD&#x27;S VIEWS OF TIME.—If time  
be of all things the most precious, wasting time  
must be the greatest prodigality, since lost time  
is never found again: aud what wc call time  
enough always proves little enough. Let us then  
up and be doing, and doing to the purpose; so  
by diligence shall we do more wit h less perplex­  
ity. Sloth makes all things difficult,but Indus­  
try all easy ; and he that riscth late must trot  
all day, and shall scarce overtake his business  
at night; while laziness travels so slowly, that  
poverty soon overtakes him. Drive thy busi­  
ness, let not that drive thee ; and early to bed  
and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy,  
and wise.

ry day at auctions, for want of minding the al-  
manac. Many a one, for the sake of finery on  
the back, have gone witha hungry belly and  
half starved their families. ‘ Silks and satins,  
scarlets and velvets, put the kitchen fire out,’  
as Poor Richard says.  
  
These are not the necessaries of life; they  
can sexrcely be called the conveniences, and yet  
only because they look pretty, how many want  
to have them? By these and other extravagan-  
nd for-  
ced to borrow from those whom they formerly  
  
ces, the gentcel are reduced to poverty, a  
despised, but, who, through industry and fru-  
gality, have maintained their standing, in which  
case it appears plainly that ‘A ploughman on  
his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees,’  
as Poor Richard says. Perhaps they have had  
a small estate left them, which they knew not  
the getting of ; they think ‘It is day and it will  
never be night,’ that a little to be spent out of  
ling;  
  
so much is not worth minding; but ¢ Always ta-  
king out of the meal tub and never putting in,  
soon comes to the bottom,’ as Poor Richard  
says; and then, ‘ When the well is dry, they  
know the worth of water’? But this they might  
have known before if they had taken his advice.  
‘if you would know the value of money, go and  
try to borrow some, for he that goes a borrow-  
as Poor Richard says;  
and indeed so does he that lends to such people,  
s to getit again. Poor Dick fur-  
ther advises and says,  
  
‘Fond pride of dress is  
  
Ere faney you consult, consult your purse.’  
  
ing goes a sorrowing,’  
  
when he goe  
sure &amp; very Carse,  
  
and  
and  
bought one fine thing, you must buy ten more,  
that your appearances may be all of a price;  
but Poor Dick says, ‘It is easier to suppress  
the first desire than to satisfy all that follow  
it. And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape  
the rich, as for the frog to swell in order to  
equal the ox.’  
  
again, § Pride is as loud a beggar as want  
  
a great deal more saucy.” When you have  
  
‘Vessels large may venture more,  
But little boats should keep near shore.’  
  
It is, however, a folly soon punished, for as  
Poor Richard says, § Pride that dines on vanity,  
sups on contempt. Pride breakfasted with  
plenty, dined with poverty and supped with in-  
famy.’ And after all, of what use is this pride  
of appearance, for which so much is risked, so  
lt cannot promote health,  
nor ease pain; it makes no increase of merit in  
the person; it creates envy; it hastens misfor-  
tunes.

for these superfluities ? We are offered by the  
terms of this sale, six month’s credit, and that,  
perhaps, has induced some of us to attend it,  
beause we cannot spare the ready money, and  
hope now to be fine without it. But ah! think  
what you do when you run in debt ; you give to  
another power over your liberty. If you can-  
not pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see  
your creditor, and will be in fear when you  
you speak to him; you will make poor, pitiful,  
sneaking excuses, and, by degrees, come to lose  
your veracity, and sink into base, downright ly-  
ing; for, ‘The second vice is lying, the first is  
running in debt,? as Poor Richard says, and  
again, to the same purpose, ‘Lying rides on  
debts back,’ whereas a free born ought not to  
be ashamed, or afraid to see or speak to any  
man living. But poverty often deprives a man  
of all sprit and virtue. -It is hard for an  
empty bag to stand upright.2 What would you  
think of that prince or that government who  
should issue an edict forbidding you to dress  
like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of  
Would you not  
say that you were free, have a right to dress as  
you please, and that such an edict would be a  
breach of privileges, and seuh a government ty-  
ranical? And yet you are about to put your-  
self under such tyranny, when you run in debt  
for such dress! Your creditor has authority at  
his pleasure to deprive you of your liberty, by  
confining you in jail till you shall be able to pay  
him. When you have got your bargain, you  
may, perhaps think little of payment, but as  
Poor Richard says, § Creditors have better mem-  
ories than debtors; creditors are a supersti-  
  
imprisonment or servidggde ?  
  
tious set, great observers of set days and times.’  
The day comes round before you are aware, and  
the demand is made before you are prepared to  
satisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind,  
the time, which at first seemed so long, will, as  
it lessens, appear extremely short. Time will  
seem to have added wings to his heels as well  
as his shoulders. * Those have a short Lent who  
owe money to be paid at Easter.’ At present,  
you may think yourselves in thriving cireum-  
stances, and that you can bear a little extrava-  
cance without injury, but  
  
‘For age and want save while you may;  
  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.’  
  
‘Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but  
even while you live, expense is constant and cer-  
tain. ‘Itis easier to build two chimneys than  
to keep one in fuel,’ as Poor Richard says, 80,  
  
| € Rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt.’

and wisdom, but, after all, do not depend too  
much upon your industry, and frugality and  
pradence, though excellent things, for they will  
all be blasted without the blessing of heaven,  
and, therefore, ask that blessing humbly, and  
be not uncharitable to those that at present  
seem to want it, bat comfort and help them.—  
Remember, Job suffered, and was afterwards  
prosperous.  
  
* And now to conclude, ‘Experience keeps a  
dear school but fools will learn in no other,’ as  
Poor Richard says, and scarce in that, for it is  
true, ‘ We may give advice, but we cannot give  
conduct.’ However, remember this, § They that  
will not be counselled cannot be helped ;? and  
further, that, * If you will not hear Reason, she  
will rap your knuckles,’ as Poor Richard says.”  
  
“Thus the old man ended his harangue. The  
people heard it and approved the doctrine, and  
immediately practised the contrary, just as if  
it had been a common sermon; for the auction  
opened, and they began to buy extravagantly.  
I found the good man had thoroughly studied  
my almanacs, and digested all I had dropped on  
these topics during the course of twenty-five  
years. The frequent mention he made of me  
must have tired any one else, but my vanity was  
wonderfully delighted with it, though I was  
conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom  
was my own which he ascribed to me, but rath-  
er the gleanings that I had made of the sense  
of all ages and nations. However, I resolved  
to be the better for the echo of it, and, though  
1 had at first determined to buy stuff for a new

Sayrines or Poor Ricuarp.*—It would be thought a hard government that  
should tax its people one-tenth part of their time, to be employed in its service ;  
but idleness taxes many of us much more: sloth, by bringing on diseases, abso-  
lutely shortens life. ‘Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor wears, while  
the used key is always bright,” as Poor Richard says. But dost thou love life,  
  
  
  
  
  
then do not squander time, for ‘that is the stuff life is made of,” as Poor Ric!  
ard says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep! forgetting  
that “the sleeping fox catches no poultry,” and that “there will be sieoping  
enough in the grave;” as Poor Richard says.  
  
If time be of all things the most precious, ‘ wasting time must be,” as Poor  
Richard says, ‘the greatest prodigality ;”’ since, as he elsewhere tells us, ** Lost  
time is never found again; and what we call time enough, always proves little  
enough. Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpose, so by diligence  
shall we do more, with less perplexity. Sloth makes all things difficult, but  
industry, all easy;” and ‘the that riseth late, must trot all day, and shall  
scarcely overtake his business at night :”  
poverty soon overtakes him. Drive thy business, let not that drive thee; and

while ‘laziness travels so slowly, that  
  
early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,” as  
Poor Richard says.  
  
So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times? We may make these  
times better, if we bestir ourselves. ‘Industry does not wish, and he that lives  
upon hope will be fasting. There are no gains without pains; then help, hands,  
for I have no lands, or if I have, they are smartly taxed. He that hath a trade  
hath un estate; and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honor,”  
as Poor Richard says; but then the trade must be worked at, and the calling  
well followed, or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes.  
If we are industrious, we shall never starve; for ‘at the working man’s house  
hunger looks in, but dares not enter.’’ Nor will the bailiff, or the constable  
enter; for industry pays debts, while despair increaseth them. What though  
you have found no treasure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, ‘ Dili-  
gence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to industry. Then  
plough deep while sluggards sleep, and you shall have corn to sell and io keep.”  
Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hin-  
dered to-morrow. ‘One to-day is worth two to-morrows,’”’ as Poor Richard  
says; and farther, ‘‘ Never leave that till to-morrow, which you can do to-day.”  
Tf you were a servant, would you not be ashamed that a good master should  
catch you idle? Are you then your own master? be ashamed to catch yourself  
idle, when there is so much to be done for yourself, your family, your country,  
and your king.—Franklin.  
  
Scorn OF THE WORLD.—Be not ashamed to wait upon others, and to be thought  
poor in this world for the love of Jesus. Boast not of thyself, but put all thy  
  
hope in God:—doing what thou canst, and he will be pleased with thy good-will.

Ir would be thought a hard government that  
should tax its people one-tenth part of their time,  
to be employed in its service; but idleness taxes  
many of us much more; sloth, by bringing on dis-  
  
eases, absolutely shortens life. Sloth, like rust,  
consumes faster than labor wears; while the used  
key is always bright. Dost thou love life, then  
do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is  
made of. How much more than is necessary do  
we spend in sleep, forgetting that the sleeping fox  
catches no poultry, and there will be sleeping  
enough in the grave!— Franklin,

Courteous reader, I have heard, that  
nothing gives an author so great a picas  
ure as to nnd works respectfully quote  
Dy otiicrs. Judge, then, bow much  
must have been gratified by an inciden  
liiat 1 am about to relate to you  
A 1 t ... &#x27;  
atoppcu my norso lately, wnore a grea  
number of peoplo were collected, at an  
auction of merchants&#x27; goods. The hou  
of the sale not being come, they were  
conversing on the badness of the times;  
and one of the company called to a plain  
clean old maD, with whito locks, &quot; Pray  
Father Abraham, what think you of the  
timex? Will not these heavy taxes quite  
ruin tho country? How shall we ever be  
able to pay them? What would you ad  
vino us to dor lather Abraham stoo  
op and replied, &quot;If you would have my  
advice, I will give it you in short; for&#x27;A  
word to tho wiso is enough, as poor Ilich  
ard says.&#x27;. I hcv joined in desiring Inn  
to speak his mind, and gathering round  
mm, uo proceeded as follows:  
&#x27; &quot;Friends,&quot; said he, &quot;the taxes are in  
deed very heavy, and, if those laid on by  
the government were tho only ones wo  
had to pay, we might moro easily dis  
charge them, but we bavo many others,  
and much more grievous to soiuo of us  
We aro taxed twico as much by ouridlc&#x27;  
ness, three times as much by our pride,  
and four times at much by our folly; and  
from tlie.so taxes the commissioners can  
not easo or deliver us, by allowing an  
abatement. However, let us hearken to  
good advice, and something may be done  
lor us; Uod helps them that hum them  
selves, as poor Hichard says.  
&quot;I. It would be thought a hard gov  
ernment, that would tax its people one-  
tenth part of their time, to be employed  
in its service; but idlciess taxes many of  
us much more; sloth, by bringing on dis  
eases, absolutely shortens lite. Moth,  
like rust, consumes faster than labor  
wears; whilst the used key is always  
bright, as Poor Richard says. How much  
more than is necessary do wo upend in  
sleep, forgetting, that Tho sleeping fox  
catches no poultry, and that There will  
bo sleeping enough m tho grave, as Poor  
Richard says.  
&quot;If time be of all things the most pre  
cious, wasting time must be, as poor Rich­  
ard says, tho greatest prodigality; since,  
as he elsewhere tolls us, Lost time is never  
found again; and what we call time  
enough, always proves littlo enough.-  
Let us then up and be dointr. and doiuir  
to tho purpose so by diligence shall we  
do moro with less perplexity. . Sloth  
makes all things difficult, but industry all  
easy; and He that riseth late must trot  
all day, and shall scarce overtake his busi­  
ness at night; whilo laziness travels so  
slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him.  
Drivo thy business, let not that drive  
thee; and Early to bod, and early to rise,  
makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.  
as Poor Richard says. .  
&quot;So what signifies wishing and boring  
for better times ? We may make these  
times belter, if wo bestir ourselves. In­  
dustry need not wish, and bo that lives  
upon hopes will die fasting. Ihero are  
no gains without pains; then help, hands;  
for I have no lands; or, if I have, they  
are smartly taxed. Ho that hath a trade  
has au estate; and he that has a calhug,  
bath an office of profit and honor, as Poor  
Richard says: but then the1 trade must be  
worked at, and tho calling followed, or  
neither tho cfitntd ricfr the office will ena  
ble us td rar odr taxed. If wd arti in  
dustrious we shall novcr starve; for, At  
tho working man a house hunger looks in  
but docs not enter. Nor will the bailiff  
or tho cdnatable enter, for industry pays  
debts, while despair iiic&#x27;f&#x27;e&#x27;ascth them.  
What though you have found no treasure,  
nor has any-rjeh relation left you a legacy.  
Diligence is tho mother of good liiok.and  
God gives all things to industry. Then  
plough deep whilo sluggards&#x27; sleep; and  
you shall have corn to sell rind to keep.  
Work while it is called to day, for you  
know not how much you maybe hindered  
to-morrow; One to-day ig worth two to­  
morrows, as Poor Richard, says; rind  
further, Never leave that till to morrow  
which you can do to-day. If you were a  
servant; would not you bo ashamed that a  
good master should catch you idle? Are  
you then your own master? Be ashamed  
to catch , yourself idle, when there is so  
much to be doiiei for yourself; your family;  
your country; and your king. Handle  
your tools without mittens remember;  
that The cat in gloves catches no mice,  
as Poor Richard says. Ii is trite there is  
much to be done, and perhaps you are  
weak-handed, but stick to it steadily, and  
you will see great effects ; for Constant  
dropping wears away stones; arid Uy dili­  
gence and patience the mouso ate in two  
thocable: and Little strokes full grcatoaks.  
Mcihinks I bcrir io&#x27;nlo of yod say,  
&#x27;Must a niau afford himself no leisure?&#x27;  
I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor  
Richard says: Employ thy time well, it  
thee means to gain leisure: and, since  
thee art not tare of a minute,&#x27; throw riot  
away an hour. Leisure&#x27; is time for doing  
something nseful; this leisure the diligent  
rifafl will obtain, but the lazy man never;  
for A life of leisure and a life of laziness  
are . two things. Many, without labor,  
would livo by their witfi only but they  
break fot viant of Stock; whereas iriddt­  
try gives comfort,- and plenty, and res­  
pect. Fly pleasures, and they will follow  
you. Tbo diligent spinner has a large  
shift; ttnd now 1 have a sheep aud a cow,  
everybody bids&#x27; me good morrow.  
&quot; II; But with our industry we must  
likewise be steady, settled and careful,  
rind oversee our own affairs, with our own  
eye-, and not trust too much to others ;  
for, as Poor Richard says, 7 . .  
&#x27; I nover saw an oft-romoved troo,  
Nor yet sa oft-removed fsmily,  
I bat fhrrrere? we!l as those that settle! to.  
  
-aim again, liirce removes are n Dad as  
  
a fife; and rigairJ; Keep thy shop, and thy  
shop will keep tbee; and again, If you  
Would have your bnfinesa done, ao: if  
not, send.  
ivim again,  
He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself rfrut cither jdnngli or drive.  
And again, Tho cyo of a niaster Will do  
more work than both of his hands ; and  
again, Want of care doesus inoiedainngo  
than want of knowledge; and again, Not  
tooveittee workmen lsTo&quot;KAvc Ihemyour  
purso open. 1 rusting to&quot;o much to others  
care is tho ruin of many; for ta the affairs  
r .i.: ...i i i i . r i  
ui mi wuun in vii nru rbvcii, not uy iuiiu  
uui iy me want ot it; out a man h own  
care is profitable; for, If you would have  
a faithful servant, and ono tlirft voti like  
servo yourscii. jituo neglect may  
breed great mischief; for want of a tiatl  
tho blioo was loit; for wailt of a shoe the  
horse was lost; and for want of a horse  
the rider was lost, being overtaken and  
Main by the enemy; all for want of a little  
care about tho horse-shoe&#x27; naii;  
&quot;II f- So much for industry, mv friend  
and attention to one&#x27;s own business; but  
to these wo must add frugality, if we  
would mako our industry more certainly  
successful. A man may if he knows not  
how to savo as he gets, keep his nose all  
his lifo to the grindstone, nnd dro not  
worth a groat at last. A fat kitchen  
makes a lean will; and  
Many estates are spent in the getting  
Since women for tea forsook spinning und knilHng,  
Ana men lor puncii lorsook bewing and splitting.  
If you would be wealthy,think of saviifg  
as well as ot getting. I lie Indies have  
not made Spain rich, because her outgoes  
were larger thau her tneomesi  
&quot;Away then with your expensivo fol  
icfl, and you will not then have so much  
cause to complain of hard times, heavy  
taxes, and chargeable families; for  
Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Mako the wealth small and tbo want groat.  
And further, What maintains one vice,  
would bring up two children, xou may  
think, perhaps; that a little tea, or a little  
punch now and then, diet a littlo moro  
costly, clothes a little finer, and A little  
entertainment now and then can bo no  
great matter; but remember, Many a littlo  
makes a mickle. Bewaro of little ex­  
penses. A small leak will sink a great  
ahipf as Poor Richard saysj and again;  
V ho dainties love shall beggars prove;  
and moreover, Fools make feasts, and  
wise men eat therm  
&quot;Here you are all got together at this  
sale of fineries and knick-knacks. You  
call tlietii goods&#x27; but, if toit do not take  
oars thoy will prove evils to some of you.  
i ou expect iney win be sou cheap, ana  
perhaps they may for less than they cost;  
but ii you have no occasiotl fdr them,  
they must be dear to you. Remember  
what Poor Richard says; Buy what thou  
hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt  
sell thy necessaries. And again, At a  
great pennyworth pauso a while. He  
means, that perhaps tho cheapness is ap­  
parent only, and not real; or the bargain,  
by straitening tbeo in thy business, may  
do thee moro barm than good. For in  
another place be says. Many have been  
ruined by buying good pennyworths.  
Again( It is foolish to lay ovlt money iri A  
purchase of repentrinco: and yet this folly  
is practiced every day at auctions, for  
want of minding tho Almanac. Many a  
onb for the sake of finery on the baok,  
havo gone with a hungry belly rind half  
starved thoir families, rnlks and satius,  
scarlet and velvets, put out the kitchen  
lire, As Poor Richard says.  
&quot;These are not the necessaries of life;  
they can scarcely bo called the conveni­  
ences; and yet only becausa they look  
pretty, how many want to have them!  
By these? and. other extravagances; the  
genteel are reduced io poverty, and forced  
to borrow of thoso whom they formerly  
despised, but who; through industry and  
frugality, have maintained their standing,  
iri which caso it appears plainly; that A  
pldugllttiirt ort his legs ii higher than a  
gentleman on his knees&#x27;, as Poor Richard  
says. . Perhaps they have bad a small es­  
tato left them, which they knew dot tho  
getting of; they think It is day, and will  
never be night; that a littlo td bo spctit  
out of so much is not worth minding; but  
Always taking out of the meal-tub; and  
never putting iri; sood cdracs to the bot­  
tom, as Poor Richard 6ays; and then;  
When tho well is dry, they know tho  
worth of water. But they might hive  
kndwn beforo if they had taken his ad­  
vice. If you would know the Value of  
money; go and try to borrow some ; for  
he that goes a borrowing goes a Borrow­  
ing, ad Poof Richard says; arid indeed 6o  
does he that lends to such people, when he  
goes to gctit in again. Poor Dick further  
advises and says;  
Fond prido of dress Is sure a very curse ;  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purso.  
And again, Pride is as loud a beggar as  
Want, and a great deal more . saucy.  
When you have bought one fine thing,  
you must biiyteti more, that your appear  
ance may be all of si piece; but I&#x27;oor Dick  
says, It is easier to suppress the first de­  
sire, than to satisfy all that &#x27;follow it  
And it is as trnly folly for the poor to ape  
the rich, as for tho frog to swell in order  
to equal tho ox.  
Vessels large rtay venture triore,  
Bat liUle boats inould keep nearsboro.  
it is, however, a folly soon punished; for  
as Poor Richard says, Pride that dines on  
vanity, sups on contempt. Pride break­  
fasted with Plenty, dined with Poverty,  
and supped with Infamy Arid, after  
all, of what nse is this pride of appear  
ance,1 for which so ronoh is naked, ao  
much is suffered? It cannot promote  
health, or ease pain; it makes no iucreaso  
of merit in the person; it creates envy;  
it hastens misfortune. -  
&quot;But what madness must it be to run  
in debt fyr these superfluities? Wc aro  
  
ofTended; by iho iefms 6f this sale, six  
month&#x27;s credit; and that perhaps; has in­  
duced some of us to attend it, because  
we cannot spare the rtady money, and  
hope now to be fine without it. But, aid  
think what you do when you run in debt;  
you giye to another power dvef your lib  
erty. If you cannot pay at the time, yod  
will bo ashamed toseo your creditor; you  
will be in fear when you speak to him;  
yod will make poor, pitiful, sneaking ex­  
cuses, and by degrees, come to lo9e your  
veracity, and sink into base, downright  
lying; fat Tho second vice is lying, tho  
first ii running id debt, a Poor Richard  
  
ways; and again, to tho same purpose,  
Lying rides upon Debt&#x27;s back; whereas a  
free-born Englishman ought not to bo  
ashamed ndr afraid to see or Kpeakto any  
man living: But poverty often deprives  
a man of all spirit arid virtue. It is hard  
for an empty bag to stand upright.  
&quot;What would you think of that prince,  
or of that government, who should issuo  
an edict forbidding you to dress liko n  
gentleman&quot; or gentlewoman, on pain of  
imprisonment or servitude? Would you  
not say that you are free, havo a right to  
dress as you please, and that such an  
edict would be a breach of your privileges,  
and such a government tyrannical? And  
yet you are about to put yourself under  
such tyranny, when you run in debt for  
such a dross! YoUr creditor has author­  
ity, at his pleasnrewto deprive you of your  
liberty by confining you in jail till you  
shall bo able to pay him. When you  
have gol your bargain, you may, pcrhapR,  
think little of payment j but, as Poor  
Richard says.Creditors have better mem  
ories thrin debtors; creditors aro a super­  
ftitious sect, great observers of set days  
and times. Thd day comes around be  
fore you aro aware, and tho demand U  
made before you are prepared to satibfy  
it; or, if you bear your debt irt mind, tho  
term which at first seemed so long, will,  
as it lessens, appcrir extremely short­  
Time will seem to have added wings to  
his heels as well as to his shoulders.  
Those havo a short Lent, who owe money  
to be paid at Easter. At present, per­  
haps, you may thirtk yourselves in thriv  
ing Circumstances, and that you can bear  
a littlo extrAvaganco without injury; but  
For age and Want save what may ;  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.  
Criia tniy be temporary and uncertain,  
but ever while yod live, expense is con­  
stant and certain; and It is easier to  
build two chimneys, than to keep ono iu  
ftlel: as Podr Richard says ; so, Rather  
go to bed mpperless, than rise in debt.  
Get what yod can, arid What yon cab get hold ;  
&#x27;Tis tho stone that will turn all your lead into gold.  
And when you have got the Philosopher&#x27;s  
stone, sure you will no longer complain  
of bad times, or tho difficulty of paying  
taxes.  
&quot;IV. This ddclrinejmy frieuds, is rea  
son rind wisdom; but, after all, do not  
depend too much upon your own indus­  
try, and frugality, and prudence, though  
excellent things, for they may all bo  
blasted, without tho blessing of Heaven,  
and, therefore, ask that blessing humbly,  
and bo not uncharitablo to those that at  
present seem to want it; but comfort and  
help them. Remember Job suffered and  
was afterwards prosperous.  
&quot;And noW; to conclude, Exporienco  
keeps a dear School, but fools will learn in  
no other, as Poor Richard says, and scarco  
in that; for, it is true, Wo may give ad­  
vice, but we cannot give conduct. How­  
ever, remember this; They that will not  
bo connselled, cannot bo helped; and  
further, that, if you will riot hear Reason,  
sho will surely rap ydur knuckles; as Poor  
Hick says.&quot;  
Thus the old gcntloman ended his ha­  
rangue: Tho peoplo heard itand approved  
the doctrine; and immediately practiced  
the contrary, just as if it had been a com­  
mon sermon; for tho auction opened, aud  
they began to buy extravagantly, t found  
the old man had thoroughly studied my  
Almanacs, and digested all I had dropped  
on these topics during the course oftwenty-five  
years: The frequent mention ho  
in ado of me must have tired any one else;  
but my vanity wa$ wonderfully delighted  
with it, though I Was conscious that not  
a tenth part of the wisdom was my own,  
Whicli he ascribed to me: but rather tho  
gleanings that I had made of tho sense  
of all ages and nations. However; I re­  
solved to be the better for the echo of it;  
and, though I bad at first determined to  
buy stuff for a new coat, I Wont away rc-  
solvod to wear my old ouo a littlo longer.  
Header, if tliott wilt do tbo iimo, thy  
profit will be ii great as mine. 1 am, as  
ever, thine to serve thee,

tlie gander. Oness that chap came away  
with a siiteli in his side  
  
The MVmy to Wcaltj^  
  
ConrtvouH reader, I linvc heard, that  
nothing gives an author so great a pleas­  
use as to Hnd his works respectfully quo­  
ted by others. Judge, then, how mudi  
I must have been gratified by an incident  
that lam about to relate to you. I stop­  
ped my hursc lately where u number of  
people were collected, at an auction of  
mcreliaul’s goods. The hour of the sale  
not being come, they were conversing on  
the badness of the limes; and one of the  
company called to a plain, dean old man,  
with white locks, •• Pray Father Abra­  
ham,what think you of the times? Will  
not these heavy taxes quite ruin the coun­  
try ? What would you advise us to do ?&quot;  
Father Abraham stood up and replied ;  
“Ifyou would have my advice, I will  
give it you in short; for ‘a word to the  
wise is enough,&#x27; as poor Richard says.&quot;  
They joined in desiring him to speak Ids  
mind, and gathering around him, lie pro­  
ceeded as follows :  
‘Friends,* said ho, ‘the taxes are in­  
deed very heavy, and, if those laid on by  
the government were the only ones we  
had to pay, we might more easily dis­  
charge them ; but we have many others  
and much more grievous to some of ns.  
We are taxed twice as much by our idle­  
ness, three times ns much by our pride, j  
and four times as much by our folly ; nod  
from these taxes the commissioner cannot  
ease or deliver us by abatement. How- 1  
ever, let ns hearken to good advice, and I  
something may he done fur us ; Clod helps j  
them that helps themselves, us poor Rich­  
ai d says.  
“I. It would be thought a hard guv­  
ennui ut that would tax the people one­  
telitli part of their time, to he employed  
in its service ; but idleness taxes us much  
mure; sloth, by bringing on diseases, ab­  
solutely shut tens life, Sloth, like rust,  
consumes (aster than labor wears; whilst  
the used key. is always bright, ns Poor  
Richard says. Rut dost tliuu love life,  
then donut squander time, for that is the  
stulf life is inaile of ns Poor Richard says.  
How unirli more than is necessary do wc  
spend in sleep, forgetting that the sleep­  
ing fox catches no poultry and that there  
u ill lie sleeping enough in the grave, as  
Poor Richard says.  
“ If lime he ot all tilings the most pre­  
cious,wasting time must he, as Pour Rich- ;  
uni says, the greatest prodigality ; since,  
as lie elsewhere tells us, lost time is never  
found again ; and what we call time  
enough, always proves little enough. Let |  
us then up and he doing, mid lining tu  
(lie purpose ; so by diligence sitali we du  
more with less perplexity. Sloth makes  
all things dillirult, but industry all easy;  
and lie that riseli! late must trot all day,  
and shall scarce overtake bis business at  
night; while Laziness travels so slowly,  
that Poverty soon overtakes him. Drive  
thy business, let not that drive thee; ami  
early to bed ami early to rise, makes n  
man healthy, wealthy, and wise, os Poor  
RicliaVd says.  
&quot;So what signifies wishing and hoping  
for better limes ? We may make these  
times belter, if wc bestir ourselves. In­  
dustry need not wish, and lie that lives  
on hope will die lasting. There are no  
gains without pains; then help, hands,  
for I have no lands ; or, if 1 have, they  
arc smartly taxed. He that hath a trade  
has an estate ; and he that tins a call­  
ing, hath an ottici- of prolit and honor, as  
Poor Richard says ; hut :hcn tiie trade  
must lie worked at, and the calling follow­  
ed, i r neither the estate or the ollice will  
enable us to pay our taxes. If we arc in­  
dusttions wo shall nevei starve; for, at  
tiie working man&#x27;s house hunger looks in  
but does nut enter. Nor will ilio ballili&#x27;  
or tiie constable enter, for industry pays  
(b lits, while despair inereasetii them.—  
What though you have found no treasure,  
nor lias suine rich relation left you u  
legacy, diligence is the mother of good  
luck, and Clod gives all tilings to industry.  
Then plough deep while sluggards sleep,  
and you shall have corn to sell and to  
keep. Work while it is called to-day, for  
you know not how much you may lie  
hindered to-morrow. One to-day is w -rth  
two to-morrows, us Poor Richard says ;  
and further, never leave Hint till tomor­  
row which you can do to-day. If you  
were a servant, would yoiynot be ashamed  
that a good master should eateh you  
idle? Arc you then your own master?  
lie ashamed to «iteli yourself idle, when  
there is so much to be done for yourself,  
your family, your country, and vour king.  
Handle your tools without mittens; re­  
member that tiie cut in gloves catches no  
mice, ns Poor Richard says. It is true  
there is much to he done, and perhaps  
you arc wenk-handed, but stick to it  
steadily and you will sue great effects ;  
for constant dropping wears away stones,  
and by dilgcnce ami patience the mouse  
ate in two tiie cable ; and little strokes  
fell great oaks.  
Metliinks 1 hear some of you say, ‘must  
a man all&#x27;ord himself no leisure?’ I&#x27;ll  
tell thee, my friend, what Poor Richard  
says: Employ thy time well, if thee means  
to gel leisure; and since thee art not sure  
of a minute, throw not away an hour.  
Leisure is Inno for doing something use­  
ful; this leisure o diligent man nil! ob­  
tain, hut the lazy man never ; for a life  
»f leisure and u life of laziness arc two  
things. Many, without labor, would live  
by their wits alone, hut they break for  
want of stock ; whereas industry gives  
comfort, and plenty and respect.. Fly  
pleasures and they will follow you. The  
diligent spinner has a large shift ; and  
now that I have a sheep and a cow, every­  
body bids me good morrow.  
“11. Hut with our industry wc must  
likewise be steady, settled, mid careful,  
and oversee our uwn a I fairs, with our own  
eyes, and not trust to others ; for, as  
Poor Richard says,  
1 never paw an oft-removed tree.  
Nor yet un ofl-rcmoved family,  
That throve bo well us those that Bottled be,  
And again, tlirce removes are as bad as a  
lire ; and again, keep thy shop and thy  
shop will keep thee, and again, if you  
you would have your business done, go ;  
if not, send. And again,  
lie (hat by (lie plough would thrive  
Himself must cither hold or drive.  
And again the eye of the master will do  
more work than both of his hands ; and  
again, want of care does us more damage  
than want of knowledge; and again, not  
to oversee workmen is to leave them your  
purse open. Trusting too much to other’s  
care is the ruin of many ; for, in the af­  
fairs of this world men are saved, not bv  
faith, but by the want of it; but a man&#x27;s  
own cure is profitable; for, if you would  
have a faithful servant, and one that you  
like, servo yourself. A little neglect may  
breed great mischief ; fur want of a noil  
the shoe was lost ; for want of a shoe the  
horse was lost; nud for want of a horse  
the rider was lost; being overtaken and  
slain by the enemy ; alt for the want of »  
little care about tbo horse-shoe nail.  
•111. So much for industry, my (Wends,  
and attention to one’s own business ; but  
to these wc must add frugality, if wo would  
maku our industry qiore certainly auccoss­  
fuk A man may if he knows not bow fo  
save as ho gets, keep Ids nose all his life  
to the grindstone, and die not worth a  
  
groat at last A fat kitchen makes a lean  
will ; and  
Many HUM art aprat In Iti fattine  
Since women for tea foraook «pinning and knitting,  
And men fur pnneb foraook bewlnf and «patting.  
If you would be wealthy, think of saving  
ns well os of getting. The Indies have  
not made Spain rich, because her outgoes  
were larger than her incomes.  
‘Away then with your expensive fol­  
lies, and you will not then have so much  
cause to complain of hard times, heavy  
taxes, and chargeable families ; fur  
Make (he wealth èmalVandlhe want great.  
And further, what maintains one vice  
would bring up two children. You may  
think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little  
punch now and then, diet « little more  
costly, clothes a little finer, and a little  
entertainment now and then, can be no  
great matter ; but remember, many % lit­  
tle makes a mickle. Rewnre ol little ex­  
penses ; a small leak will sink n great ship,  
ns Poor Richard says ; and again, who  
dainties love, shall beggars prove; and  
moreover, Fools make feasts, and wise  
men cat them.  
* Here you arc all got together at this  
sale of fineries ami knick-knacks. You  
call them goods ; but, if you do not take  
care they will prove evils to some of you.  
Von expect they will be sold cheap, and  
perhaps they may for less than they cost ;  
but, if you have no occasion for them,  
they must be dear to you. Remember  
what Poor Richard says : Huy what thou  
hast no need of, and ere long thou shall  
sell thy necessaries. And again, at a  
great pennyworth pause a while. He  
means, that perhaps the cheapness is ap­  
parent only, and not real ; or the bargain,  
by straitening tlicc in tby business, may  
tin thee more harm than good. For in  
another place he says, many hove been  
ruined by hying good pennyworths.—  
Again, it is foolish to lay out money in a  
purchase of repentance ; and yet this folly  
is practised every day at auctions, for want  
of mi tiding the Almanac. Many a one for  
the sake of finery on the back, have gone  
with a hungry belly and half starved their  
families. Silks and satins, scarlet and  
velvets, put out the kitchen fire, as Poor  
Richard says.  
‘These arc not (ho necessaries of life;  
they can scarcely be called the convenien­  
ces ; and yet, only because they look pret­  
ty, how many want to have them! Ry  
these, and oilier extravagances, the gen­  
teel are reduced to poverty, and forced to  
borrow of those whom they formerly de­  
spised, but who, through industry and  
frugality, have maintained their standing,  
in which case it appears plainly, that A  
ploughman on his legs is higher than n  
gentleman on his knees, ns Poor Richard  
says. Perhaps they have had a small es­  
tate left them, which they knew not the  
gutting of; they think it is day, and will  
I never be night ; that a little to ho spent  
&#x27; out of so much is not worth minding; but  
always taking out of the meal tub, and  
never putting in, soon comes to the bot­  
tom, ns Poor Richard says; and then,  
when the well is dry, they know the  
worth of water. But they might have  
known before, if they had takcnliis advice.  
If you would know the value of money go  
and try to borrow some ; for he that goes  
I a borrowing goes a sorrowing, as Poor  
Richard says ; and indeed ao does be that  
lends to such people, when he goes to get  
in again. Poor Dick further advises and  
says,  
I&#x27;ond pride of drew it ture » very curie ;  
Ere fti.cy you cumuli, cumuli yuur purte.  
And again, Pride is as loud a beggar as  
Want, and n great deal more saucy. When  
you have bought one fine thing, you must  
buy ten more, that your appearance may  
lie all of a piece ; hut Poor Dick says, it  
is easier to suppress ilio first desire, than  
to satisfy all that follow it. And it is ns  
truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as  
for the frog to swell in order to equal the  
ox.  
Vetselt Urge may venture more,  
Uut little buati ehoulil keep near there.  
It is, however, n fully soon punished; for  
us Poor Richard says, pride that dines on  
vanity, sups on contempt Pride break­  
fasted with Plenty, dined with Poverty,  
and supped with Infamy. And, alter all,  
of what use is this pride of appearance,  
for which so much is risked, so much is  
suffered f It cannot promote health, nor  
ease ppin; it makes no increase ot merit  
in the perspn ; it creates envy ; it hastens  
misfortune.  
‘ Hut what madness must it be to run  
in debt fur these superfluities I Wo are  
otfended, by the terms of this sale, six  
months’ credit ; and that perhaps, has In­  
duced some of us to attend it, becauhs wo  
cannot spare the ready money, and hope  
now to be fine without it. Uut, ah I think,  
what you do when you run in debt ; you  
give to another power over your own lib­  
erty. If you cannot pay at the time, you  
{ wifi be ashamed to sec your creditor ;  
i you will be in fear when you speak to  
j him ; you will make poor, pitiful, sneak­  
■ ing excuses, and by degrees, come to lose  
i your veracity, and sink into base, down­  
| right lying ; for the second vice is lying,  
I the first is running in debt, ns Poor Rich­  
ard says ; and again, to the same purpose,  
Lying rides upon Debt’s back ; whereas  
a free-born Englishman ought not to be  
ashamed nor afraid to see or to speak to  
any man living. Rut poverty often de­  
prives a man of all spirit and virtue. It is  
hard (or an empty bag to stand upright  
“What would you think of that prince,  
or that government who should issue an  
edict forbidding you to dress like a gen­  
tleman or gentlewoman, on pain of im­  
prisonment or servitude f Would you  
not say that yon were free, have a right  
to dress ns you please, and (hat such an  
edict would he a breach of your privile­  
ges, and such a government tyrannical ?  
And yet yon arc about to put yourself  
under such tyranny, when you run in  
debt for such a dress ! Your creditor baa  
authority, at ills pleasure, to deprive you  
of your liberty, by confining you in jail  
till you shall be able to pay him. When  
you have got vour bargain, you may,  
perhaps, think little of payment ; but, as  
Poor Richard says, creditors have better  
memories than debtors ; creditors are a  
superstitious sect, great observers of set  
days and times. The day comes ttroond  
before you arc aware, and the demand la  
made before you are prepared to satisfy  
it ; or, if you bear your debt in mind,the  
term, which at first seemed .so long, with,  
as it lessens, appear extremely short—  
Time will seem to hivd added wings to*  
his heels as well as to his shoulders. Thom  
have a short Lent who owi&#x27; faaoney to he

UNDER THE SEA.  
BY LLOYD WYMAN.  
  
Tue bold sun splintered his golden lance  
In the cause of the beautiful Day,  
  
On the starry shield of the conqueror Night,  
Who closed in the fiery fray,  
  
And stained the vest of the shrinking west  
With a plash of crimson spray.  
  
But the blood of the day soon paled away  
In the gleams of dying light,  
  
And the violet flower of twilight bloomed  
On the highest heavenly height,  
  
And silence fell! and over the earth  
Is the calm ofa cloudless night.  
  
The white moon hangs in the purple eas

in sleep, forgetting that the

“ If time he of all things the most pro*

dustrv need not wish, and he that UyeSt

locks,&quot; whom the bystanders called &quot;Fs­  
ther Abraham,&quot;--so runs the little fiction  
in which Franklin wraps his philosophy,

&quot;Will not those heavy taxes quite ruin the  
country?&quot; &quot;How shall we be able to pay  
them? Father Abraham stood up and re­  
  
&quot;Friends, the taxes are indeed vere  
beavy; and if those laid on by the  
ment were the only ones we had to pay,  
we might more easily discharge them; but  
we have many others, and much more greiv­  
ous to some of us. We are taxed twice as  
much by our idleness, three times as much  
by our pride, and four times as much by  
our folly; and from these taxes the  
sioners cannot ease or deliver us by allow  
ing an abatement. However, let us heark­

&quot;keeps his nose all his life to the grind­  
stone, and die not worth a groat at last. A  
fat kitchen makes a lean will,&quot; and  
Since women for tea forsook spinning  
men for punch for sook hewing and slitting.&quot;  
If you would be wealthy, think of saving  
as well as of getting. The Indies have not  
made Spain rich, because her out goes are  
greater than her incomes,  
Away then with your expensive follies,  
and you will not then have so much cause  
to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and  
chargeable families  
  
You may think, perhaps, that a little tea  
or superfluities now and then, diet a little  
more costly, clothes a little finer, and a lit  
the entertainment now and then, can be no  
great matter; but remember, &quot;many a little  
makes a mickle.&quot;  
Beware of little expenses: &quot;A small  
leak will sink a great ship,&quot; as Poor Rich­  
ard says; and again, &quot;Who dainties love,  
shall beggars prove; and moreover, &quot;fools  
inake feasts and wise men eat them.&quot;  
Here you are all got together to this sale  
of fineries and nick-nacks. You call them  
goods; but if you do not take care they will  
prove evils to some of you. You expect  
they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they  
may for less than they cost; but if you have­  
no occasion for them they must be dear to  
you.  
Remember what Poor Richard says,  
Buy what thou hast no need of, and ere  
long thou shalt sell thy necessaries  
And again, &quot;At a great Pennyworth,  
panse awhile.&quot; He means, perhaps, that  
the cheapness is apparent only, and not  
real; or the bargain, by straitening thee in  
thy business, may do thee more harm than  
good; for in another place he says &quot;Many  
have been ruined by buying good penny-  
worths.&quot;  
  
Again, &quot;It is foolish to lay out money in  
the purchase of repentance;&quot; and yet this  
folly is practised every day at auctions, for  
want of minding the almanac  
Many, for the sake of finery on the back,  
have gone with a hungry stomach, and half  
starved their families. &quot;Silks and satins,  
scarlets and velvets, put out the kitchen  
fire,&quot; as Poor Richard says. These are not  
the necessaries of life; they can scarcely be  
called the conveniences; and yet, only be-  
cause they look pretty, how many want to  
have them?  
By these and other extravagances, the  
are reduced to poverty, and forced  
to borrow of those whom they formerly de­  
spised, but who through industry and fru­  
gality have maintained their standing; in  
which case it appears plainly that, &quot;A  
ploughman on his legs is higher than a gen­  
tleman on his knees,&quot; as Poor Richard says  
Perhaps they had a small estate left them,  
which they know not the getting of; they  
think &quot;It is day and will never be night  
that a little to be spent out of so much is  
not worth minding; but &quot;Always taking  
out of the mealtub, and never putting in,  
soon comes to the bottom,&quot; As Poor Rich­  
ard says, and then, &quot;When the well is dry,  
they know the worth of water.&quot;  
But this they might have known before,  
if they had taken his advice: &quot;If you would  
know the value of money, go and try to  
borrow some; for he that goes a borrowing  
goes a sorrowing,&quot; as Foor Richard says  
and, indeed, so does he that lends to such  
people, when he goes to get it again. Poor  
Dick further advises.  
&quot;Fond peide of dress is sure a very curse.  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.&quot;  
And again, &quot;Pride is as loud a beggar  
as want, and a great deal more saucy.&quot;  
  
When you have bought one fine thing,  
you must buy ten more, that your appear  
ance may be all of a piece; but Foor Dick  
says, &quot;It is easier to suppress the first de  
sire than to satisfy all that follow it;&quot; and  
it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the  
rich, as for the frog to swell in order to  
equal the ox.  
&quot;Vessels largs my venture more.  
But litth bouts should keep near shore.&quot;  
It is, however, a folly soon punished;  
for &quot;Pride that dines on vanity, sups on  
contempt; pride breskfasted with plenty,  
dined with poverty, and supped with in-  
famy.  
And, after all, of what use is this pride  
of appearance, for which so much is risked,  
so much suffered? It es nnot promot.  
health, nor ease pain; it makes no increass  
of merit in the person; it creates eavy, it  
hastens misfortune.  
TooL Borrowees. A tocl borrower is  
a tool breaker. He that knows how to use  
tools keeps them in order and always has  
them ready for use. There is nothing more  
trying to the good workman, when he has  
just sharpened his tools and put them in  
their appropriate places, than to have some  
shiftless comrade catch one of them up,  
turn the edge, break it, knock the handl

Judge then how much I must have been grati-  
fied by an incident I am going to relate to you.  
I stopped my horse lately where a great num-  
ber of people were collected at an auction of mer-  
chant’s goods. The hour of the sale not being  
come, they were conversing on the badness of  
the times; and one of the company called toa  
plain, clean old man with white locks, “Pray,  
Father Abraham, what think you of the times?  
Will not these heavy taxes quite ruin the coun-  
try? How shall we be able to pay them?  
What would you advise us to?” Father Abra-  
ham stood up and replied, “If you would have  
my advice, I will give it you in short, for ‘A  
Word to the wise is enough,’ as Poor Richard  
says.” They joined in desiring him to speak  
his mind, and, gathering around him, he pro-  
ceeded as follows:  
  
“Friends,” said he, “the taxes are very heavy,  
and if those laid on by the government were the  
only ones we had tu pay, we might more easily  
discharge them; but we have many others, aud  
  
  
  
|  
  
much more grievous ones to some of us.  
  
much by our folly ; and from these taxes the  
commissioners cannot ease or deliver us, by al-  
lowing an abatement. However, let us hearken  
to good advice, and something may be done for  
us; ‘God helps them that help themselves,’ as  
Poor Richard says.  
  
“I. It would be thought a hard government  
that should tax its people one-tenth part of their  
time, to be employed in its service, but idleness  
taxes many of us much more; sloth, by bring-  
ing on disease, absolucely shortens life. ‘Sloth,  
like rust, consumes faster than labor wears,  
while the used key is always bright,’ as Poor  
Richard says. ‘But dost thou love life, then  
do not squander time, for that is the stuff life  
is made of,’ as Poor Richard says. How much  
more than is necessary do we spend in sleep,  
forgetting that ‘The sleeping fox catches no  
poultry,’ and ‘That there will be sleeping enough  
in the grave,’ as Poor Richard says.  
  
‘If time be of all things the most precious,  
wasting time must be,’ as Poor Richard says,  
‘the greatest prodigality,’ since, as he elswhere  
tells us, ‘Lost time is never found again ; and  
what we call time enough, always proves little  
enough.’ Let us, then, up and be doing, and  
doing to the purpose ; so by diligence shall we  
do more with less perplexity. Sloth makes all  
things difficult, but industry all easy, and he  
that riseth late must trot all day and shall  
scarce Overtake his business at night, while La-  
ziness travels so slowly, that Poverty soon over-  
takes him. ‘Drive thy business, let not that  
drive thee, and early to bed and early to rise,  
makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,’ as  
Poor Richard says.  
  
“So what signifies wishing and hoping for  
better times? We make these times better if  
we bestir ourselves. ‘Industery need not wish,  
and he that lives upon hopes will die fasting.  
There are no gains without pains; then help,  
hands, for I have no lands, or, if I have, they  
are smartly taxed. He that hath a trade hath  
an estate, and he that hath a calling hath an  
office of profit and honor,’ as Poor Richard  
says ; but then the trade must be worked at, and  
the calling followed, or neither the estate nor  
the office will enable us to pay our taxes. It  
we are industrious we shall never starve; for,  
‘at the working-man’s house hunger looks in but  
dare not enter.’ Nor will the bailiff or the con-  
stable enter; for ‘Industry pays debts, while  
dispair increaseth them.’ What though you  
have found no treasure, nor has any rich rela-  
tion left you a legacy? ‘Diligence is tke mo-  
ther of luck, and God gives all things to indus-  
try.’ ‘Then plow deep, while sluggards sleep,  
and you shall have corn to sell and to keep.’  
Work while it is called to day, for you know  
not how much you may be hindered to-morrow.  
‘One to-day is worth two to-morrows,’ as  
Poor Richard says, and further ‘Never leave  
that till .to-morrow which you can do to-day.’  
If you were a servant, would you not be  
ashamed that a good master should cateb you  
idle? Are you, then, your own master? Be  
ashamed to catch yourself idle when there is s

much to be done for yourself, your family and  
Handle your tools without mit-  
tens; remember that “The cat in gloves catches  
no mice,’ as Poor Richard says. It is true  
there is much to be done, and perhaps you are  
weak handed, but stick to it steadily, and you  
will see great effects, for ‘Constant dropping  
wears away stones,’ and ‘By diligence and pa-  
tience&#x27; the mouse ate through the cable,’ and  
‘Little strokes fell great oaks.’  
  
‘Methinks I hear some of you say, ‘Must a  
man afford himself no Jeisure?’ I will tell thee,  
my friend, what Poor Richard says, ‘Employ  
thy time well, if thou meanest to gain leasure,  
and since thou art not sure of a minute, throw  
away not an hour.’ Leisure is time for doing  
something useful ; this leisure the diligent man  
will obtain, but the lazy man never; fora life  
of leisure and a life of laziness are two things.  
Many, without labor, would live by their wits  
only, but they break for want of stock, whereas  
industry gives comfort, and plenty, and respect.  
Fly pleasures, and they will follow you. ‘The  
diligent spinner has a large swift: and now I  
have a sheep and a cow, everybody bids me  
good morrow.’  
  
“II. But with industry we must likewise be  
steady, settled and careful, and oversee our own  
affairs with ourown eyes, and not trust too much  
to others ; for as Poor Richard sayr,  
  
‘I never saw an oft removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft removed family,  
That thrive as well as those that settled be.’  
  
And again, “Three removes are as bad as a  
fire;’ and again, ‘Keep thy shop, and thy shop  
will keep thee;’ and again, ‘If you would have  
your business done, go—if not, send.’ And  
again,  
  
‘He that by the plow would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.’  
  
And again, ‘The eye of the master will do  
more work than both his hands;’ and again,  
‘Want of care does us more damage than want  
of knowledge ;’ and again, ‘Not to oversee work-  
men is to leave them your purse open.’ ‘Trust-  
ing too much to others’ care is the ruin of many.  
For in the affairs of this world men are saved,  
not by faith, but by the want of it, but a man’s  
own care is profitable ; for ‘If you would have  
a faithful servant, and one that you like, serve  
yourself,’ A little neglect may breed great mis-  
chief; ‘for want of a nail the shoe was lost;  
for want of a shoe the horse was lost; for want  
of a horse the rider was lost, being overtaken  
and slain by the enemy.’ All for want of a lit-  
tle care about a horse shoe nail.

attention to one’s own business ; but to these we  
must add frugality, if we would make our in-  
dustry more certainly successful. A man may,  
if he knows not how to save as he gets, keep

may think, perhaps, that a little tea or a little  
punch, now and then, diet a little more costly,  
clothes a little finer, and alittle entertainment  
now and then, can be no great matter; but re-  
member, ‘inany a little, makes a mickle.’ Be-  
ware of little expenses; ‘A smal! leak will sink  
a great ship,’ as Poor Richard says; and again,  
‘Who dainties love, shall beggers prove;’ and  
moreover, ‘Fools make feasts and wise men eat  
them,’  
  
“Here you are, altogether at this sale of  
knick-knacks. You call them goods; but, if finer-  
ies, take care, or they will prove evi/s to some  
of you. You expect they will be sold cheap,  
and perhaps they may for less than the cost;  
but, if you have no occasion for them, they  
must be dear to you. Remember what Poor  
Richard says, ‘Buy what thou hast no need of,  
and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.’  
And again, ‘At a great penneyworth, pause  
a while.” He means that perhaps the cheapness  
is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain,  
by straightening thee in thy business, may do  
thee more harm than good, For in another place  
he says, ‘Many have been ruined by buying  
Again, ‘It is foolish to  
lay out money in a purchase of repentance,’ and  
yet this folly is practiced every day at auctions,  
for want of mindingthe almanac. Many a one,  
for the sake of finery on the back, has gone  
with a hungry belly and half starved their fam-  
ilies. ‘Silks and satins, scarlets and velvets,  
put the kitchen fire out,’ as Poor Richard says.  
  
‘These are not the necessaries of life; they can  
scarcely be called theconveniences, and yet only  
because they look pretty, how many want to  
havethem? By these and other extravagances,  
the genteel are reduce to poverty, and forced to  
borrow from those whom they formerly despised,  
but, who, by their frugality, have maintained  
their standing, in which case it appears plainly  
that ‘A plowman on his legs is higher than  
a gentleman on his knees,’ as Poor Richard  
says. Perhaps they have had a small estate  
left them, which they knew not the getting of;  
they think ‘It is day and it will never be night,’  
that a little to be spent out of so much is not  
worth minding; but ‘Always taking out of the  
meal tub and never putting in, soon comes to  
the bottom,’ as Poor Richard says; and then,  
‘When the well is dry, they know the worth of  
the water.’ But this they might have known  
before if they had taken his advice. ‘If you  
would know the worth of money, go and try to  
borrow some, for he that goes a borrowing goes  
asorrowing,’ as Poor Richard says ; and indeed  
so does he that lends to such people, when be  
goestogetit again. Poor Dick further advises  
and says,  
  
‘Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse,  
  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.’  
and again, ‘Pride is as loud a begger as Want,  
and a great deal more saucy.’ When you have  
bought one fine thing, you must buy ten more,  
that your appearance may be all of a piece ; but  
Poor Dick says, ‘It is easier to suppress the  
first desire than to satisfy all that follow it.  
And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the  
rich, as for the frog to swel] in order to equal  
the ox.’  
  
  
  
  
  
‘Vessels large may Wnture more,  
But little boats should keep near shore.’  
  
“It is, however, a folly soon punished, for ag  
Poor Richard says, ‘Pride that dines on vanity,  
sups on contempt. Pride breakfasted with plen-  
ty, dined with poverty, and supped with infamy,’  
And after all, of what use is this pride of ap.  
pearance, for which so much is risked, so much  
is suffered? It cannot promote health, nor ease  
pain; it makes no increase of merit in the per-  
son; it creates envy; it hastens misfortunes,  
  
“But what madness must it be to run in debt  
for these superfluities? We are offered by the  
terms of this sale, six month’s credit, and that  
perhaps, has indnced some of us us to attend it,  
because we cannot spare the ready money,  
and hope now to be fine without it. But al!  
think what you do when you run in debt; you  
give to another power over your liberty. Ifyou  
cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to  
see your creditor, and will be in fear when you  
speak to him ; you will make poor, pitful, sneak-  
ing excuses, and, by degrees, come to lose your  
varacity, and sink into base, downright lying;  
for, ‘The second vice is lying, the first is run-  
ning in debt,’ as Poor Richard says, and again,  
to thesame purpose, ‘Lying rides on debt’s back,’  
whereas a freeborn ought not to be ashamed,  
or afraid to see or speak to any man living,  
But poverty often deprives a man of all spirit  
and virtue. ‘It is hard for an empty bag to  
stand upright.’ What would you think of that  
prince or that government who should issue an  
edict forbidding you to dresa like a gentleman or  
gentlewoman, on pain of imprisonment or ser-  
vitude? would you not say that you were free,  
have aright to dress as you please, and that  
such an edict would be a breach of privileges,  
and such a government tyranical? And yet you  
are about to put yourself under such tyranny,  
when you run in debt for such dress! Your  
creditor has authority at his pleasure to deprive  
you of your liberty, by confining you in jailill  
you shall be able to pay him. When you haw  
got your bargain, you may, perhaps think little  
of payment, but as Poor Richard says, ‘Credi-  
tors have better memories than debtors; credi-  
tors are a superstitious set, great observers of  
set days and times.’. The day comes round be-  
fore you are aware, and the demand is made  
before you are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you  
bear your debt in mind, the time, which at first  
seemed long, will as it lessens, appear extreme-  
ly short. Time will seem tohaveadded wingsto  
his heels as wellas his shoulders. ‘Those have  
a short Lent who owe money to be paid at Eas-  
ter.’ At present you may think yourselves  
in thriving circumstances, and that you can  
bear a little extravagance without injury, but  
  
‘For age and want, save while you may;  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.’  
  
“Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but  
even while you live, expense is constant and  
certain. ‘It is easier to build two chimneys than  
to keep one in fuel,’ as Poor Richard says, 80,  
‘Rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt.’  
  
“IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and  
wisdom, but, after all, do not depend too much  
upon your industry, and frugality and prudence,  
though excellent things, for they will all be blast

ed without the blessing of heaven, and, there-  
fore, ask that blessing humbly, and be not un-  
charitable to those that at present seem to want  
it, but comfort and helpthem. Remember, Job  
suffered, and was afterwards prosperous.  
  
“And now to conclude, ‘Experience keeps a  
dear school but fools will learn in no other,’ as  
Poor Richard says, and scarce in that, for it is  
true, ‘We may give advice, but we cannot give  
conduct.’ However, remember this, ‘They that  
will not be counselled cannot be helped;’ and  
further, that , ‘If you will not hear Reason, she  
will rap your knuckles,’ as Poor Richard says.”  
  
Thus the old man ended his harangue. The  
people heard it and approved the doctrine, and  
immediately practised the contrary, just as if it  
had been a common sermon; the auction opened,  
and they began to buy extravagantly. I found  
the good man had thoroughly studied my al-  
manacs, and digested all I had dropped on these  
topics during the course of twenty-five years.  
The frequent mention he made of me must have  
tired any one else, but my vanity was wonder-  
fully delighted with it, though I was conscious  
that not a tenth part of the wisdom was my  
own which he ascribed to me, but rather the  
gleanings that I had made of the sense of all  
ages and nations. However, I resolved to be  
the better for the echo of it, and, though I had  
at first determined to buy stuff for a new coat, I  
went away resolved to wear my old one a little  
longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the same, thy  
profit will be as great as mine.

True Now as Then.  
That common sense philosopher. Dr.  
Franklin, in his day refuted an objec­  
tion against large taxation bv show­  
ing that our heaviest taxes are not  
imposed by government. In his  
■* Way to Wealth,” he represents a  
plain, clean old man, with white locks,  
called “ Father Abraham,” as being  
asked,—  
“Will not these heavy taxes ruin  
the country? How shall tve ever bo  
able to pay them ?”  
Father Abraham replied, “ Friend?;  
the taxes are indeed very heavy ; and  
if those laid by the government were  
the only ones we had to pay, we  
might the more easily discharge them ;  
but we have many others, and much  
more grievous to some of us We are  
taxed twice as much by our own idle­

claure is time for doing something useful.  
  
This leisure the diligent man will obtain,

and a life of laziness are tro things. Many,  
without Libor, would live by their wi&#x27;s only,  
but they break for want of stock; whereas,  
industry gives comfort, and plenty, and re-

“11, But with oar industry we must like-  
wise be steady, settled, and careful; and  
oversee our own affairs with our own eyes,  
and not trust too much to others; for, as  
Poor Richard says—-  
  
  
  
** ] never saw an oft removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft removed family,  
That throce so well as é that settled be.  
  
And again, ZArce removes are as bad aa a  
Jire; and again, Acep thy shop, and thy shop  
will heep thee; and again, If you would have  
your business dene, go; Uf not, send; and  
again—  
** He that by the plough would thrice,  
Himself must cither or drive,  
  
And again, The cye of a maater will do more  
work than both his hands; and again, Want  
HA care docs us more damage than want of  
rnowledge,; andagain, Not to vcersce workmen,  
is to leave them your purse open, Trusting  
two much to others’ care is the ruin of many;  
for Jn the affairs of THIB world men are  
saved, not by Justh, but by the want of u; but  
a man&#x27;s own care is profitable; for, Jf you  
would hace a faithful servant, and one that  
  
w like, serve yourself. A little neglect may

lost; for want of « horse the rider was lost,  
beng overtaken and slain by the enemy, au  
Jor want of a litle care about a horse-shoe  
nad  
  
“LIL, So much for industry, my friends,  
and attention to one’s own business, But  
to these we must add frugality, if we would  
make our industry more certainly successful.  
A man may, if be knows not how to save as  
he gets, keep bis nose all his life to the  
grindstone, and cie not worth a groat at  
Inet.” A fat kitchen makes a lan wil; and—

Since women for tea, forsook spinning and  
Anittang,  
And men for punch forsook hewing and

If you would be wealthy, (ink of saving aa

&#x27;  
  
* Women and tine, yame and deceit,  
Make the wealth small, and the want great.  
  
And further— Wiot maintains one vice,

the Almanac. Many a one, for the sake o  
floery on the back, bas gone with a hungry  
belly, and half-starved his family. Ailks  
and satina, scarica and eeloets, put out Hie  
  
kitchen-fire, as Pour Richard says.  
** These are not the necessaries of life;  
veniences ;  
  
yet, only because they look pretty, how  
want to have them? By these and  
other extravagances, the genteel are re-  
deced to poverty, and forced to borrow of  
those they formerly despised, bat who,  
pe industry and frugality, bave main-  
tal their standing; in wh ch case it ap-  
pears plainly that A ghman on his lege  
ts higher than a non his knece, as  
Poor Riobard says. Perbaps they have had  
a small estate left them, which they knew  
not the getting of. They think, 7 Oey,  
and wi never be night; that a little to  
*pent out of so moch, is sot worth minding;  
but Always taking out of the meal-tub, and  
never putting in, scon comes to the bottom, as  
Poor Richard says; and then, When the well  
ts dry, they know the worth of water. But  
this they might have known before, if they  
bad taken advice, If s. trould know  
the value of money, go and try to borrow  
some; for He that goes a borrowing, goes a  
sorrowing, as Poor Richard says; and in-  
deed so does be, that lends to such people  
when be goes to get it again. Poor Richard  
further advives and says—  
  
** Fond pride of dress ia sure a very curse ;  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your puree.  
  
And again—Pride ia as loud a beggar as  
Want, and a great deal more . When  
ou have bought one fine thing, you must  
  
y ten more, that your appearance may  
; but Poor Richard says,  
  
be all of a  
It ia easier to reas the desire, than to  
satiafy all that it. nd it is as truly a  
  
fully for the poor to ape the rich, as for the  
frog to swell in order to equal the ox.  
  
** Vesecla large may venture more ;  
But idle boats should keep near shore.  
  
It is, however, a folly soon punished ; for,  
as Poor Richard says, wy - do breaks on  
ory: 5 on contem Y ‘asted  
with ent, dined with Poverty, and supped  
with Infamy. And after all, of what use is  
this e of appearance, for which so much  
ie risked and suffered’ It can not  
  
health, nor ease pain; it makes no increase  
of merit in the person; it creates envy; it  
hastens misfortane,  
  
* But what madness must it be to run  
into debt tor these supertluities! We are  
offered, by the terms of this sale, six  
months’ credit; and that, perbaps, bas in-  
duced some of us to attend it, because we  
cannot spare the ready money, and hope  
now to be fine without it. But ah! think  
what you do, when you run into debt! You  
  
ive tounether power over your ewn liberty.  
ft you cannot pay at the time, you will be  
ashamed to see your creditor; you will be  
in fear when you speak to bim; you will  
make poor, pitiful, sueaking excuses; and  
by - oy come to lose your veracity, and  
sink into base, downright lying; for The  
second vice ts Lying, when the first ts running  
into debt, as Poor Richard says; and agsin,  
to the same purpose, Lying rides upon  
Debts back; whereas, a freeborn American  
ought not to be ashamed, nor afraid to see  
or to speak to any man living. But poverty  
often deprives a man of all spirit and vir-  
tue. Jt is hard for an empty sack to stand  
upright,  
** What would you think of that prince, or  
of that government, that should issue an  
edict forbidding you to dress like a geutle-  
man, or a gentlewoman, on pain of imprison-  
ment or servitude’ Would you not say that  
you were free, had a right to dress as you  
please, and that euch an edict would be a  
vreach of your privileges, and such a go-  
vernment tyrannical? And yet you are  
about to put yourself under such a tyranny,  
when you run into debt for such dress!  
Your creditor has authority, at his pleasure,  
to deprive you of your liberty, by confining  
ou in jail till you shall be able to pay him.  
yhen you have got your bargain, you may  
rpaps think little of payment; but, as  
oor Richard says, Creditors have better me-  
moriea than debtors; creditors are a supereti-  
tious sect, great observers of act days and  
t&amp;mea, The day comes round before you  
are aware, aud the demand is made before  
you are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you  
bear your debt ia mind, the term, which  
at first seemed so long, will, as it lessens,  
appear extremely short. Tiwe will seem to  
have added wings to bis heels, as well as hia  
shoulders, Those have a short Lent, who owe  
money to be paid at Laster, At present you  
may perhaps think yourselves in thriving  
circumstances, and that you can bear a little  
extravagance without injury; but—  
  
‘* For age and want save what you may;  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.  
  
**Gain may be temporary and uncertain;  
but ever, while you live, expense is constant  
aod certain; and Jt is eaner to build two  
  
chimneys than to keep one in fue, aa Poor | ©  
  
Richard says; #0, Mather goto bed supper-  
leas, than rise in debt.  
  
** (Jet what you can, and what you gat hold;  
* Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into  
  
‘And, when you have got this philoso-  
pher&#x27;s stone, you will eurely uo longer com-  
plain of bad times, or the difficulty of pay-  
ing taxes,  
  
“IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason  
and wisdom; but, after all, do not depend  
too much u your own industry, and fra-  
gality, and prudence, though excellent  
things; for py bed all be blasted, without  
the blessing of Heaven; and, therefore, ask  
that blessing humbly, and be not i-  
table to thoee that at present seem to want  
it, but comfort and help them. Remember,  
Job suffered, aud was afterward pros-  
perous,  
  
** And now, to conclude, Experience keeps  
a dear school, but fools will learn in no other,  
as Poor Richard says, and scarcely in that;  
for it is trae— We may give advice, bul we  
cannot gite conduct. However, remember  
thie: They that will not be cownselled, cannet

&quot;Away then with your expensive fol­

‘Woraea ami wine, game and deceit.  
Moke the wealth small, and the want great.&#x27;  
And further, &#x27;What maintains one vice  
would bring up two children.* You any  
think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little  
punch, now and then, or a diet a little  
mere costly, clothes a little finer, and a  
j little entertainment now and then can be  
, no great matter ; but remember. Many a  
little makes a mickle.* B‘ware of little  
expenses. ‘A small leak will sink a great

prove ; and. moreover. ‘Foals make feasts,

I lenda to sweh people, get  
it again. Poor Richard farther advises  
and rays—  
‘Fond pride of dress is sore s very corse;  
I | Ere fanev you consult, consult your puuc.&#x27;  
f And again—‘Pride is aa load a beggar  
; &quot; Want, and a great deal mure saucy.’  
; When you hare brought one fine thing,  
1 you must buy tea m&lt;wv, that your ap­  
pearance may be ell of a piece; bat Poor  
’ Richard says, ‘lt is easier to suppress the  
first desire, then to satisfy all that follow  
1 it.&#x27; And it is as truly folly for the  
! poor to ape the rish, a* for the freg to  
1. swell in order to equal the ox.  
rV&gt;see’* l.trge mar venture more;  
But little boat* should keep near shore.’  
It N, however, a folly souq punished ;  
1 for, as Poor Richard says, ‘Pride that  
! dines on vanity, sups on contempt.’—  
■ ! ‘Pride break fisted with Plenty, dined  
I with Poverty, and uppod with Infamy.’  
| And after ail, of whit use is this pride of  
appearance, for which so much is risked  
&#x27; and suffered ? It cannot promote health,  
’ | nor ease pain ; it makes do increase of  
j merit in the person ; it creates envy; it  
,f hast &#x27;ns misfortune.  
•’But what madneu must it be to run  
into debt fur these superfluities ! We arc  
offered, by the terms of this sale, six  
months* credit; and that, perhaps, ha  
induced some of us to attend it, because  
wo cannot spare the ready m &gt;nev, and  
’ hope now to be fine without it. But ah I  
think wha you do,.when you run into  
1 debt ! You giro to another power over  
, your own liberty. It you cannot pay at  
: the time, you will bo ashamed to nee yonr  
!creditor; you will be in fear when you  
penk to him; you will make poor, piii­  
( ml. sneaking exius*w; and by degrees  
come to lost veracity, and sink into base,  
downright lying ; *f..r ‘The second vice j  
is Lying, when the first is ruuuiog into  
debt,’ as Poor Richard says; and again ,  
to the same purpose/ ‘iSjJfoj ride* upon &gt;  
Debt’s back ;’ whereas, a freeborn Amer- |  
. ican ought not to be ashamed, nor afraid  
to see or to speak to any man living.— *|!  
, But poverty oflon deprives a man of all  
spirit and virtue. ‘lt is hard for an emp­  
-1 ty sack to stand upright.’  
“What wou’d vou think of that prince,  
or of tint government, that should issue  
an edict forbidding you to dross like a  
gentleman, or a gentlewoman, on piin of,  
imprisonment or servitude? Would&#x27;vou  
not say that yon were free, had a right  
ro dress as yon please, and that such an  
! edict would be a breach of yonr privi­  
-1 lege*, and such a government tyranniesl*  
And yot yoa are about to pat yourself  
under such Ivranny when you run into  
debt for sacli dress. Yoarcreditor basan- j  
Ihority, st his pleasure, to deprive yon  
of yonr liberty, by confining you in jail j  
j till yoa shall be able to pay him. When  
i you have got your bargains you may per­  
j b;ips tb:nk little of payment; but, as  
! Poor Ricb*rl says, ‘Creditors have bet­  
j ter memories than debtors ; creditors are  
1 a superstitions sect, great observer* of  
set days and limes.’ ♦he day comes  
round before yon are aware and the de­  
mand is made before you are prepared to  
satify it ; or, ff yon bear your debt in  
mind, the term, which at first s-emed  
lung, will, as it lessens, appear extreme­  
ly short. Time will seem to have added  
I winga to his heele, as well as hit should­  
. or*. ‘Those hare a short Lent, who owe  
! money to he paid at Easier.’ At present  
you may perhaps think yourselves in  
thriving circumstances, and that yon can  
bear a little extravagance without injury;  
bat—  
Tor age am! want save what rou may;  
5o morning sun lusts a whole day.’  
“Gain may be temporary and unecr­  
i tain ; but remember while you live, ex­  
pease is constant an 1 certain ; and *lt is  
easier to build two chimneys thaatoke&gt;p  
: one in fuel/ as Poor Richard says ; so,  
llathvr go to bed suppcrless, than rise iu  
i debt.’  
Ost what yoa ran. and what rou get hold;  
. Tts the cow that will torn all your lead into

| “And, when you hare got this philos­

those laid by the government were the  
only ones we had to pay, we might easily  
discharge them ; but we have many  
others, and much more grievous to some

ruin the &#x27;eountrj? How shall we  
ever be able to pay them? &#x27;  
Father Abraham replies: Friends,  
the taxes are indeed heavy; and if  
those laid by&#x27; the government were  
tue oniy ones we naa to pay, we  
might easily discharge them; but  
we have many others, and much  
more grievous to some of us. We  
are taxed twice as much by our

idleness,&#x27; three times as much by  
onr pride, and four times as &#x27;much  
by our folly; and from these taxes  
he commissioners cannot ease or  
deliver us by alldwing an abate

good advice, and&#x27; something may  
be done for ns. . God helps those

I have heard, that nothing gives an  
author so great pleasure, as to find his  
works respectfully quoted by others.  
Judge, then, how much I must have  
been gratified by an incident I am  
going to relate to you. I stopped my  
horse lately, where a great number of  
people were collected, at an auction of  
merchant&#x27;s goods. The hour of the  
sale not being come, they were conver-­  
sing on the badness of the times; and  
one of the company called to a plain,  
clean old man, with white locks, Pray,  
Father Abraham, what think you of the  
times? Will not these heavy taxes  
quite ruin the country? How shall we  
ever be able to pay them? What would  
you advise us to? Father Abraham  
stood up, and replied, If you would  
have my advice, I will give it to you  
in short, &quot;for a word to the wise is en­  
ough,&quot; as Poor Richard says. They  
joined in desiring him to speak his mind  
and gathering round him, he proceeds  
as follows  
  
Friends, says he, the taxes are in-­  
deed very heavy, and if those laid on  
by government were the only ones we  
had to pay, we might more easily dis-­  
charge them; but we have many others,  
and much more grevious to some of us.  
We are taxed twice as much by our idle-­  
ness, three times as much by our pride,  
and four times as much by our folly  
and from these taxes the commissioners  
can not ease or deliver us, by allowing  
an abatement. However, let us hear-­  
ken to good advice, and something may  
be done for us; &quot;God helps them that  
help themselves,&quot; as poor Richard  
says.  
1. It would be thought a hard  
Government that should tax its people  
one tenth part of their time, to be em-­  
ployed in its service; but idleness taxes  
many of us much more; sloth, by bring-­  
ing on disease, absolutely shortens life.  
&quot;Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than  
labor wears, while the used key is al-­  
way bright,&quot; as poor Richard says.  
&quot;But dost thou love life, then do not  
squander time, for that is the stuff life  
is made of,&quot; as poor Richard says.  
How much more than is necessary do  
we spend in sleep! forgetting that  
&quot;the sleeping fox catches no poultry,  
and that there will be sleeping enough  
in the grave,&quot; as poor Richard says.  
&quot;If time be of all things the most  
precious, wasting time must be,&quot; as  
poor Richard says, &quot;the greatest

The Traveler and HIts Friends prodigality;&quot; since, as he elsewhere  
tells us, &quot;lost time is never found again  
and what we call time enough, always  
proves little enough;&quot; let us then up  
and be doing, and doing to the purpose  
so by diligence shall we do more with  
less perplexity. Sloth makes all  
things difficult, but industry all easy  
and he that riseth late, must trot all  
day, and shall scarce overtake his  
busiless at night; while laziness travels  
so slowly that poverty soon overtakes  
him. Drive the business, let not that  
drive thee; and early to bed, and early  
to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy  
and wise,&quot; as poor Richard says.  
  
BY YOHN G. SANE.  
  
So what signifies wishing and hoping  
for better times? We may make these  
times better if we bestir ourselves.  
&quot;Industry need not wish, and he that  
lives upon hope will die fasting. There  
re no gains without pains, then help  
hands, for I have no lands,&quot; or if I  
have they are smartly taxed. &quot;He  
that hath a trade, hath an estate; and  
he that hath a calling, hath an office of  
profit and honor,&quot; as poor Richard  
says; but then the trade must be work-­  
ed at, and the calling well followed, or  
neither the estate nor the office will  
enable us to pay our taxes. If we are  
industrious we shall never starve; for,  
&quot;at the working man&#x27;s house hunger  
looks in, but dares not enter.&quot; Nor  
will the bailiff or the constable enter  
for &quot;industry pays debts, while despair  
increaseth them.&quot; What though you  
have found no treasure, nor has any  
ic eaton e o a ega ie  
  
you a legacy, &quot;dili-  
  
gence is the mother of good luck, and  
God gives all things to industry. Then  
plough deep, while sluggards sleep, and  
and you shall have corn to sell and to  
keep. &quot;Work while it is called to-day,  
for you know not how much you may  
be hindered to-morrow. &quot;One to-day is  
worth two to-morrows,&quot; as poor Rich-­  
ard says; and farther, &quot;never leave  
that till to-morrow, which you can do  
to-day.&quot; If you were a servant, would  
  
Methinks I hear some of you say,

you not be ashamed that a good master  
their families; &quot;silks and satins, scarlet  
catch you idle? Are you  
  
catch yourself idle, when there is so  
much to be done for yourself, your  
family, and your country. Handle  
your tools without mittens; remember,  
that &quot;the cat in gloves catches no  
mice,&quot; as poor Richard says. It is  
true, there is much to be done, and  
perhaps you are weak-handed; but  
stick to it steadily, and you will see  
great effects, for &quot;constant dropping  
wears away stones; and by diligence and  
patience the mouse ate in two the ca-­  
ble; and little strokes foll great oaks.&quot;

since thou art not sure of a minute,

Many, without labor, would

own eyes, and not trust too much to  
others; for, as poor Richard suys,

Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.&quot;  
  
And again, &quot;three removes is as bad

&quot;if you would have your business done,

And again, &quot;the eye of a master will  
do more work than both his hands;

damage than want of knowledge;&quot; and

III. So much for industry, my  
friends, and attention to one&#x27;s own  
business; but to these we must add  
frugality, if we would make our in-­  
dustry more certainly successful. A man  
may, if he knows not how to save as he  
gets, &quot;keep his nose all his life to the  
grindstone, and die not worth a groat  
at last. A fat kitchen makes a lean  
will;&quot; and  
&quot;Many estates are spent in the getting,  
Since women for tea foresook spinning and  
knitting,  
And men for punch forsook hewing and  
splitting.&quot;  
&quot;If you would be wealthy, think of  
  
so  
  
much cause to complain of hard times,  
heavy taxes, and chargeable families  
for  
&quot;Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth small, and the want  
great.&quot;  
And farther, &quot;what maintains one vice,  
would bring up two children.&quot; You  
may think, perhaps, that a little tea,  
or a little punch now and then, diet a  
little more costly, clothes a little finer  
and a little entertainment now and then,  
can be no great matter; but remember,  
&quot;many a little makes a mickle.&quot; Be­  
ware of little expenses; &quot;a small leak  
will sink a great ship,&quot; as poor Richard  
says; and again, &quot;who danties love,  
shall beggars prove;&quot; and moreover,  
fools make feasts, and wise men eat  
them.&quot;  
  
Here you are all got together to this  
sale of fineries and nick-nacks. You  
call them goos, but if you do not take  
care, they will prove evils to some of  
you. You expect they will be sold  
cheap, and perhaps they may, for less  
than they cost; but if you have no oc-­  
casion  
  
them, they must be dear to  
  
you. Remember what poor Richard  
says, &quot;buy what thou hast no need of,  
and ere long thou shalt sell thy neces-­  
saries.&quot; And again, &quot;at a great pen­  
ny-worth pause a while.&quot; He means,  
that perhaps the cheapness is apparent  
and not real; or the bargain, by  
straitening thee in thy business, may  
do thee more harm than good. For in  
another place he says, &quot;many have  
been ruined by buying good penny-­  
worths.&quot; Again, &quot;it is foolish to lay  
out money in a purchase of repent-­  
ance;&quot; and yet this folly is practised  
every day at auction, for want of mind-­  
ing the almanac. Many a one for the  
sake of finery on the back, have gone  
with a hungry belly, and half starved  
  
and wolgote nut t th  an o  
  
as poor Richard says. These are not  
  
the necessaries of life, they can scarcely  
be called the conveniencies; and yet,  
only because they look pretty, how  
many want to have them? By these  
and other extravagancies, the genteel  
are reduced to poverty, and forced to  
borrow of those they formerly despised,  
but who, through industry and frugali-­  
ty, have maintained their standing; in  
which case it appears plainly, that &quot;a  
ploughman on his legs is higher than a  
gentleman on his knees,&quot; as poor Rich-­  
ard says. Perhaps they have had a  
small estate left them, which they knew  
not the getting of; they think &quot;it is  
day, and will never be night;&quot; that a  
  
worth minding; but &quot;always taking  
out of the meal-tub, and never putting  
in, soon comes to the bottom,&quot; as poor  
Richard says; and then, &quot;when the  
well is dry, they know the worth of  
water.&quot; But this they might have  
known before, if they had taken his

for the poor to ape the rich, as for the  
frog to swell in order to equal the ox.

increase of merit in the person; it  
  
in debt for these superfluities! we are  
offered, by the terms of this sale, six  
months&#x27; credit; and that perhaps has  
induced some of us to attend it, because  
we can not spare the ready money, and  
hope now to be fine without it. But  
ah! think what you do when you run  
in debt; you give to another power  
over your liberty. If you can not pay  
at the time, you will be ashamed to see  
your creditor; you will be in fear when  
you speak to him, when you will make  
poor, pitiful, sneaking excuses, and by  
degrees come to lose your veracity, and  
sink into base, downright lying; for,  
&quot;the second vice is lying; the first is  
running in debt,&quot; as poor Richard  
says; and again, to the same purpose,  
lying rides upon debt&#x27;s back;&quot; wher-­  
as a free-born American ought not to  
be ashamed nor afraid to see or speak  
  
sain a e a o ein e o an an iin a oer oten  
  
deprives a man of all spirit and virtue.  
&quot;It is hard for an empty bag to stand  
upright.&quot; What would you think of  
that prince or of that Government, who  
should issue an edict forbidding you to  
dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman,  
on pain of imprisonment or servitude  
Would you not say, that you were free,  
have a right to dress as you please, and  
that such an edict would be a breach  
of your privileges, and such a govern-­  
ment tyrannical? And yet you are  
about to put yourself under that tyran-­  
ny, when you run in debt for such dress!  
your creditor has authority, at his  
pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty,  
by confining you in gaol for life, or by  
selling you for a servant, if you should  
not be able to pay him. When you  
have got your bargain, you may per-­  
haps think little of payment; but, as  
poor Richard says, &quot;creditors have bet-­  
ter memories than debtors; eciditors  
are a superstitious set, great observers  
of set days and times.&quot; The day comes  
round before you are aware, and the  
demand is made before you are pre-­  
pared to satisfy it; or, if you bear your  
debt in mind, the term, which at firs  
seemed so long will, as it lessens, ap-­  
pear extremely short; time will seem  
to have added wings to his heels as  
well as his shoulders. &quot;Those have a  
short Lent, who owe money to be paid  
at Easter.&quot; At present, perhaps you  
may think yourselves in thriving cir-­  
cumstances, and that you can bear a  
little extravagance without injury; but  
&quot;For age and want save while you may,  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.&quot;  
Gain may be temporary and uncertain,  
but ever, while you live, expense is  
constant and certain; and, &quot;it is easier  
to build two chimneys than to keep  
one in fuel,&quot; as poor Richard says; so  
&quot;rather go to bed supperless than ris  
in debt.&quot;  
&quot;Get what you can, and what you get hold,  
&#x27;Tis the stone that will turn all your lead  
into gold.&quot;  
And when you have got the philoso-­  
pher&#x27;s stone, sure you will no longer  
complain of bad times, or the difficulty  
of paying taxes.  
  
Iv. This doctrine, my friends, is  
reason and wisdom; but, after all, do  
not depend too much upon your own  
industry, and frugallity, and prudence,  
through excellent things; for they may  
all be blasted, without the blessing of  
Heaven; and therefore ask that bles-­  
sing humbly, and be not uncharitable  
to those that at present seem to want  
it, but comfort and help them. Re-­  
member Job suffered, and was after-­  
wards prosperous.  
  
And now, to conclude: &quot;experience  
keeps a dear school, but fools will learn  
in no other,&quot; as poor Richard says,  
and scarce in that; for it is true,

member this, &quot;they that will not be  
counselled, can not be helped;&quot; and  
farther, that &quot;if you will not hear

Thus the old gentleman ended his  
harangue. The people heard it and  
approved the doctrine; and immediate-­  
ly practised the contrary, just as if it  
had been a common sermon, for the  
auction opened, and they began to buy  
extravagantly. I found the good man  
had thoroughly studied my almanacs,  
and digested all that I had dropt on  
those topics during the course of twenty  
five years. The frequent mention he  
made of me must have tired any one  
else; but my vanity was wonderfully  
delighted with it, though I was con­  
scious that not a tenth part of the wis-­  
dom was my own, which he ascribed to  
me, but rather the gleanings that I  
had made of the sense of all ages and  
nations. However, I resolved to be  
the better for the echo of it; and,  
though, I had at first determined to  
buy stuff for a new coat, I went away,  
resolved to wear my old one a little  
longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the  
same, thy profit will be as great as  
mine.

Money, as the means of procuring the  
necessaries and comforts of life, is a  
blessing; and to be careful of it is a duty  
incumbent on all.  
To lay Ly in time of youth, and  
whilst we enjoy good health, a portion  
of the fruits of industry in store for fu­  
ture wants, is a mark of wisdom; and  
considering that all are liable to insirmi  
ties, a provision to alleviate them is of  
the greatest importance.  
If is a great mistake to suppose that  
small sums are not worth saving. By  
the habit of saving in little matters,  
riches are acquired; dollars saved soon  
accumalates to large amounts.

 Bayard.  
Tobacco Ciikwino.—The habit of to­  
bacco chewing has been condemned by  
one of the Hippodrome revivalists. It is  
an unclean and unwholesome habit, injur­  
ious In the mouth, the stomach, the lungs,  
tho blood, and the nervous system. It has  
decreased in the eastern and central por­  
tions of this country within the present  
generation, through tho progress of good  
taste, refinement, and elegant manners.  
It still prevails widely in many parts of  
the West and South, especially in those  
dull places where the enjoyments of life  
are few, and men feel a constant desire  
for some sort of stimulus.  
I never saw an oft-removed tree, nor  
yet an oft-removed family, that throve as  
well as those who settled be.—FmnMin.

Remember what Poor Itichaid  
savs, &#x27;• Buy what thou Last 110 need  
of, and ere lotip thou shalt sell thy  
  
necessaries.  
And again, &quot;At a great JJOIIII v­  
worth, pnuse awhile.&quot; He menus,  
perhaps, that the cheapness is ap­  
parent only, and not real; or the  
bargain, by straitening thee in thy  
business, may do thee more harm  
than good; for in another place he  
says, &quot; Many have been ruined by  
bying good pennyworths.&quot;  
Again, &quot;It is foolish to lay out  
  
money in the purchase of repen­  
tance;&quot; and yet this folly is practiced  
every day at auctions, for want of  
minding the almanac.  
Many, for the sake of finery on the  
back, have gone with a hungry  
stomach, and half-starved their fam­  
ilies. &#x27;&#x27; Silks and satins, scarlets and  
velvets, put out the kitchen fire,&quot; as  
Poor Richard says. These are not  
the necessaries of life; they can  
scarcely be called the conveniences;  
and yet, only because they look  
pretty, how many want to have  
them!  
By these and other extravagances,  
the genteel are reduced to povery,  
and forced to borrow of those whom  
they formerly despised, but who  
through industry and frugality have  
maintained their standing; in which  
case it appears plainly that &quot; A  
plowman 011 his legs is higher than  
a gentleman on his knees,&quot; as Poor  
Richard says. Perhaps they had a  
a small estate left them, which they  
knew not the getting of; they think  
&quot;it is day, and will never be night;&#x27;  
that a little to be spent out of so  
much is not minding: but &quot; Always  
taking out of the meal-tub, and nev­  
er putting in, soon conies to the  
bottom,&quot; as Poor Richard says; and  
then, &quot; When the well is dry, they  
know the worth of water.&quot;  
  
But this they might have known  
before, if they had taken his advice:  
&quot; If you would know the value of  
money, go and try to borrow some;  
for he that goes u-borrowiug goes a-  
Borrowing,&quot; as Poor Richard says;  
and. indeed, so does he that lends to  
such jrfrople. hlh u he goes t&lt;&gt; get it

to the prospects of times in the fu  
ture quoted by others. Judge, then,  
how much I must have been gratified  
by an incident ajn going to relate  
to you. I stopped my horse lately,  
when a great number of the good  
farmers were present, while convers­  
ing on the badness of the times; one  
of the party called to a plain old  
man, with white locks: Uncle John,  
what think you of the times? Will  
not those heavy taxes quite ruin the  
country? How shall we ever be able  
to pay them? What would you ad­  
vise us to do? Uncle John replied:  
If you would have my advice I will  
give it you, for a word to the wise is  
enough. Friends, says he, the taxes  
are indeed very heavy; and if those  
laid on by the government were the  
only ones we had to pay we might  
more easily discharge them; but we  
have many others, and much more  
grievous to some of us. We are  
taxed twice as much b}’ our idleness;  
three times as much by our pride,  
and four times as much by our folly.  
And from these taxes the commis­  
sioners cannot ease or deliver us by  
allowing an abatement. But let us  
hearken to good advice. God helps  
them that helps themselves. So  
what signifies wishing and hoping  
for better times? We may make  
these times better if we bestir our­  
selves. Industry need not wish and  
he that lives upon hope will die fast­  
ing. There are no gains without  
pains. Then help hands for I have  
  
no lands; or if 1 have they are  
smartly taxed.  
1 never saw an oft removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft removed family.  
That throve so well as those settled be.  
Again, Keep thy farm and thy  
farm will keep thee. Three removes  
is as bail as a lire. If you would  
have your business done, go; if not,  
send.

Fi unrts, Kays ho, ami neighbors, the  
Taxes aro indeed very heavy, and if  
those Ia&#x27;ul on by the Government were  
the only ones we had to pay, we  
might more easily discharge them ;  
but we have many others, and much  
more gricvoui to some of us. &quot;We  
are taxed twice as much by our Idle­  
ness, three times as much by our  
Pride, and four times as much by our  
Folly, and from these Taxes the Ooni­  
misxioiiers cannot ease or del Tver us  
by allowing an abatement. However  
let us hearken to good advice, and  
  
something may be done for us : God  
  
helps them that help themselves, as  
  
poor Richard says, in his Almanack of  
  
It would be thought a hard Govern  
  
ment that should tax its people one-  
  
tentu pari ot their tune, to be em  
  
ployed in its service. But idleness  
taxes many of us much more, if we  
  
reckon all that is spent in absolute  
  
foloth, or doing of nothing, with that  
  
which is spent in idle employment or  
  
amusements, mat amounts to noth  
  
ing. teioth, by bringing on diseases,  
  
absolutely shortens life. Sloth, like  
  
rust, consumes laster than labor  
  
wears, while the used key is always  
bright, as poor Richard says. But  
  
uosi mou love lile, then do not  
  
squander time, for that&#x27;s the stuff life  
  
Is made of, as poor Richard savs  
  
How much more than is necessarv do  
  
Ave spend in sleeping? forgetting that  
the sleeping Fox catches no poultry,  
  
ana mat mere win he sleeping enough  
  
in me grave, as poor Richard says  
  
ai time uc ot an things the mot pre  
  
ciuu, wasuii&#x27;r oi umo must be. as  
  
poor Richard says, the greatest prodi  
  
gality, since, as he elsewhere tells us,  
lost time is never found again : and  
  
what we call time-enough, alwavs  
  
proves little enough : Let us then up  
  
aim uc aoing to the purpose; so by  
  
diligence shall wo do more with less  
perplexity. Sloth makes all things  
dillicult, but industry all things uasy.  
  
as poor Richard says; and lie that  
riseth late, must trot all day, and shall  
  
scarce overtake Jus business at night  
  
While laziness travels so slowly, that  
  
jKMcriy soon overtakes hun. as we  
  
read in poor Richard, who adds, drive  
thy business, let not that drive thee ;  
and early to bed, and carlv to rise,  
makes a man healthy, wealthy and  
  
wise.  
  
bo what signifies wishing and hop  
  
nig ior belter times. We may make  
  
them tin-cs better if we bestir our­  
selves. Industry need not wish, as  
  
poor luchard says, and he that lives  
upon hope will die fiistinir. There  
  
are no gains, without i.ains ; then help  
  
nanus, ior x nave no lands, or if 1  
  
have, they are smartly taxed. And  
as poor Richard likewise observes.  
  
ho that hath a trade hath an estate,  
and he that hath a calling hath an  
oJIice of prolit and honor; but then  
the trade must be worked at. and the  
calling well followed, or neither tha  
  
estate, nor the oflice, will enable i  
  
pay our taxes. If we are industrious  
  
wo -shall never starve, for, as poor  
  
Juchard says, at the workingman&#x27;s  
house hunger looks in, but dares not  
  
enter; is or will the baihil or the con  
  
stablo enter, ior industry pays debts,  
while despair increaseth them, says  
poor Richard. What though you  
have found no treasure, norhasanv  
  
rich relation left you a legacy, dili  
  
gence is the mother of good luck, as  
  
poor .uicnam says, ami God gives all  
  
things to industry. Then plough  
deep, while sluggards sleep, and you  
  
shall have corn to sell and to keep,  
  
oay a juH 1J1CK. Ol tC While It IS  
called to-day, for you know not how  
much may be hindered to-morrow,  
  
which makes poor Kichard sav, one  
to-day is worth two to-morrow&#x27;s, ami  
larthcr, have you somewhat to do to­  
morrow, do it to-day. If you Ave re a  
servant, would you not be ashamed  
that a good master should catch you  
idle? Are vou then vour-own mas  
  
ter, be ashamed to catch yourself idle, !  
us poor Dick says. When there so  
much to be done for yourself, your  
family, your country, and your graci­  
ous King, be up by the peep of day :  
lA&#x27;t not the sun look down and say,  
inglorious he lies. Handle your  
tools without mittens; remember that  
the cat in gloves catches no mice,  
as poor Richard says. &#x27;Tis true there  
is much to be done, and perhaps you  
arc weak handed, but stick to it  
steadily, and you will see great effects,  
for constant dropping wears away  
stones, and by diligence and patience,  
the mouse ate in two the cable ; and  
little strokes fell great oaks, as poor  
Richard says in his Almanack, the  
year I cannot just now remember.  
Want of care does tu more damage  
than want of knowledge ; trusting too  
much to others care is the ruin of  
many; for, as the Almanack says, in  
the affairs of this world, men are  
saved, not by faith,but by the want of  
it; but . i man&#x27;s own care&#x27;is profitable;  
Ior, saith ioor Dick, learning is to the  
  
siuuious, and ric hes to the careful, as  
  
wen as power to the bold, and heaven  
to the virtuous. And father, if you  
  
would have a faithful servant, and  
one that you like, serve yourself. And  
  
uaui, uc auviteh to circumspection  
and care, even in the smallest matters,  
  
M.-.-iiuM: t-pmeumes a utue neglect may  
  
...vv pn-ui mistimi ; awuuing ior  
  
want ot a nail the hoe was lost;  
for want of a shoe the horse was lost;  
and lor want of a horse the rider was  
lost, being overtaken and slain bv the  
v.. ..11 j r  
  
vi.cuij, an ior want ot care about a  
  
Horse-shoe nail.  
  
bo much lor industry, my friends,  
  
and attention to one s own busme  
  
but to these we must add frugality, if  
  
we would make our Industry more  
certainly successful. A man inav, if  
  
he knows not how to save as ho gets,  
  
xecp his nose all las life to the grind  
  
stone, and die not worth a groat at  
  
last. A fat kitchen makes a lean will,  
as poor Richard savs. and.  
  
- - i 1  
Many estates are loJ t in the fretting,  
. s-inco women tor tea forsook tpiuuiiiiuul  
kllittillu&#x27;.  
Aud men for punch forsook hewing and  
splitting.  
If you would be wealthy, says ho,  
in another Almanack, think of saving  
as well as of getting:  
For n-e and want, save while you may;  
.No morning emu lasts a whole day,  
as poor Richard says. Gain may be  
temporary and uncertain, but ever,  
while you live, expense is constant  
and certain; and &#x27;tin easier to build  
two chimnics than to keep one in  
file I, ai poor Richard says. So rather  
to Led slipperiest than rise in debt.  
  
iet. whutvmi can. and what vou tret bold;  
  
&#x27;lis the stone that w ill turn all your lead J  
  
into gold,  
as poor Richard says. And when you  
have got the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, sure  
you will no longer complain of bad  
times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.  
The doctrine, my friends, is reason  
and wisdom ; but after all, do not de­  
pend too much upon your own indus­  
try, and frugality, and prudence,  
though excellent things, for thev raav  
  
all be blasted without the blessing of  
heaven ; and therefore ask that bless­  
ing humbly, and be not uncharitable  
to those that at present seem to want  
it, but comfort and help them. Re­  
member Job suile red, and was after­  
wards prosperous.  
And now to conclude, experience  
keeps a dear school, but fools will  
learn in no other, and scarce in that ;  
for it is true, we may give advice, but  
we cannot give conduct. However, re  
  
member this, they that won t be coun­  
seled, can&#x27;t be helped, as poor Richard  
says; and farther, that if you will not  
hear reason, she&#x27;ll surely rap vour  
  
knuckles.

as poor Richard says How |  
much more than is necessary !  
do we spend in sleeping? for |  
getting that the sleeping Fox &lt;  
catches no poultry, and that !  
there will be sleeping enough |  
in the grave, as poor Richaul &#x27;  
says. If time beof vt 1)- things &#x27;

hoiytr; but then the trade  
must be worked at, and the  
i calling well followed, 01 noi

will enable us to pay our tax­  
es. If we are industrious we  
shall never starve, for, as poor

inan.s house hunger looks in,  
but dares not enter. Nor will

Richard say, one to-day is  
worth two tomorrows, and  
farther, have you somewhat  
to do to-morrow, do it to day.  
If you were a servant, would  
you not he ashamed that, a  
good masteihshoiild catch you  
idltv? A re you t hen your own  
master, be ashamed to catch  
yourself idle, as poor Dick  
“says. When there is so much  
to be done for yourself, your  
family, your country, and  
your gracious King, be up  
by the py*ep of day: Let nut  
the sun look down and say,

your tools without mittens;

perhaps you are weak handed

says, in the affairs of this

which he entitled ‘Poor  
Richard.’’ These sayings have been extracted from his almanacs.  
The American people are justly proud of Franklin on account of his  
achievements in science and his ability as a statesman. They re-  
member with gratitude his patriotism and public services in the per-  
ilous hour when there was need of men with both mind and heart.  
If the time shall ever cme, and we think it will not, when posterity  
shall forget the statesman and man of science, his practical proverbs  
will still be the watchwords of thrift and industry. Franklin was  
born in 1706; died in 1790.)  
  
  
  
CourRTEous READER: I have heard that nothing gives  
an author so great pleasure as to find his works respectfully  
quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I must have been  
gratified by an incident Iam going to relate to you. I stopped  
my horse, lately, where a great number of people were col-  
lected at an auction of merchants’ goods. The hour of the  
sale not being come, they were conversing on the badness  
of the times; and one of the company called toa plain, clean  
old man, with white locks, ‘‘Pray, father Abraham, what  
think you of the times? Will not those heavy taxes quite  
ruin the country? How shall we be ever able to pay them?  
What. would you advise us to?’’? Father Abraham stood up,  
and replied, “If you would have my advice, I will give it  
you in short; ‘for a word to the wise is enough,’ as Poor  
Richard says.’’ They joined in desiring him to speak his  
mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows :—  
  
  
  
“Friends,” says he, ‘‘the taxes are indeed very heavy::  
and, if those laid&#x27;on by the government were the only ones.  
we had to pay, we might more easily discharge them; but  
we have many others, and much more grievous to some of  
us. Weare taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times  
as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly;  
and from these taxes the commissioners can not ease or de-  
liver us by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken  
to good advice, and something may be done for us; ‘God  
helps them that help themselves,’ as Poor Riehard says.  
  
“T. It would be thought a hard government that would  
tax its people one-tenth part of their time to be employed in  
its service; but idleness taxes many of usmuch more: sloth,  
by bringing on diseases, absolutely shortens life. ‘Sloth,  
like rust, consumes faster than labor wears, while the used  
key is always bright,’ as Poor Richard says. ‘But dost thou  
love life, then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life  
is made of,’ as Poor Richard says. How much more than is  
necessary do we spend in sleep! forgetting that ‘The sleep-  
ing fox catches no poultry, and that there will be sleeping  
enough in the grave,’ as Poor Richard says.  
  
‘* ‘Tf time be of all things the most precious, wasting time  
must be,’ as Poor Richard says, ‘the greatest prodigality;’  
since, as he elsewhere tells us, ‘Lost time is never found  
again; and what we call time enough, always proves little  
enough.’ Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the pur-  
pose, so by diligence shall we do more with less-perplexity.  
‘Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry all easy, and  
he that riseth late, must trot all day, and shall scarce over-  
take his business at night; while laziness travels so slowly,  
that poverty soon overtakes him. Drive thy business, let  
not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to rise,  
makes a man healthy, Wealthy and wise,’ as Poor Richard  
says.  
  
“So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times?  
We may make these times better, if we bestir ourselves.  
‘Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon hope will  
die fasting. There are no gains without pains; then help  
hands, for I have no lands,’ or if I have they are smartly  
taxed. ‘He that hath a trade, hath an estate; and he that  
hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honor,’ as Poor  
Richard says; but then the trade must be worked at, and  
the calling well followed, or neither the estate nor the office  
will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are industrious we  
shall never starve; for ‘at the workingman’s house hunger  
looks in, but dares not enter.’ Nor will the bailiff or the  
constable enter, for ‘industry pays debts, while despair in-  
creaseth them.’ What though you have found no treasure,  
nor has any rich relation left a legacy, ‘Diligence is the  
mother of good luck, and God gives all things to industry.  
Then plough deep, while sluggards sleep, and you shall have  
  
corn to sell and to keep.’ Work while it is called to-day,  
  
for you know not how much you may be hindered to-mor-  
row. ‘One to-day is worth two to-morrows,’ as Poor Richard  
says; and farther, ‘Never leave that till to-morrow, which  
you can do to-day.’ If you were a servant, would you not  
be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle? Are  
you then your own master? Be ashamed to catch yourself  
idle, when there is so much to be done for yourself, your  
family, your country, and your king. Handle your tools  
without mittens; reniember, that ‘The cat in gloves catches  
no mice,’ as Poor Richard says. It is true there is much to  
be done, and, perhaps, you are weak-handed; but stick to it  
steadily, and you will see great effects; for ‘Constant drop-  
ping wears away stones; and by diligence and patience the  
mouse ate in two the cable; and little strokes fell great  
oaks.’  
  
“Methinks I hear some of you say, ‘Must a man afford  
himself no leisure?’ I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor  
Richard says: ‘Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to

gain leisure; and; since thou art not sure of a minute, throw  
not away an hour.’ Leisure is time for doing something use-  
ful; this leisure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy  
man never; for ‘A life of leisure and alife of laziness are two  
things. Many, without labor, would live by their wits only,  
put they break for want of stock,’ whereas industry gives  
comfort, and plenty, and respect. ‘Fly pleasures and they  
will follow you. The diligent spinner has a large shift: and  
now I have a sheep and a cow, everybody bids me good  
morrow.’  
  
“TJ. But with our industry we must likewise be steady,  
settled, and careful, and oversee our own affairs with our  
own eyes, and not trust too much to others, for, as Poor  
Richard says, reg  
  
‘I never saw an oft removed tree,  
Nor yet an oft removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.’  
  
“And again, ‘Three removes is bad as a fire;’ and again  
‘Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee;’ and again,  
‘If you would have your business done, go; if not, send;’  
and again,  
  
‘He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.’  
  
And again, ‘The eye of the master will do more work than  
both his hands;’ and again, ‘Want of care does us more  
damage than want of knowledge;’ and again, ‘Not to over-  
see workmen, is to leave them your purse open.’ Trusting  
too much to others’ care is the ruin of many; for ‘In the  
affairs of this world, men are saved, not by faith, but by the  
want of it;’? but a man’s own care is profitable, for, ‘If you  
would have a faithful servant, and one that you like, serve  
yourself. A little neglect may breed great mischief; for  
want of a nail the shoe was lost; for wantofa shoe the horse  
was lost; and for want of a horse the rider was lost,’ being  
overtaken and slain by the enemy; all for want of a little  
care about a horse-shoe nail.  
  
“TIT. So much for industry, my friends, and attention to  
one’s own business; but to these we must add frugality, if we  
would make our industry more certainly successful. A man  
may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, ‘keep his nose  
all his life to the grindstone, and die not worth a groat at  
last. A fat kitchen makes a lean will;’ and,  
  
‘ Many estates are spent in the getting,  
Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,  
And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.’  
  
‘If you would be wealthy, think of saving, as well as of get-  
ting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, because her  
out-goes are greater than her in-comes.’  
  
“Away then with your expensive follies, and you will not  
then have so much cause to complain of hard times, heavy  
taxes, and chargeable families; for  
  
*‘ Women and wine, game and deceit,  
Make the wealth small, and the want great.’  
  
And farther, ‘What maintains one vice would bring up two  
children.’ You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a  
  
little punch now and then, diet a little more costly, clothes |  
  
a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then,  
  
can be no great matter; but remember, ‘Many a little makes |  
  
amickle.’ Beware of little expenses; ‘A small leak will  
sink a great ship,’ as Poor Richard says; and again, ‘Who  
dainties love, shall beggars prove;’ and moreover, ‘Fools  
make feasts, and wise men eat them.’ Here you are all got  
together to this sale of fineries and nick-nacks. You call  
them goods, but, if you do not take care, they will prove evils  
tosome of you. You expect they will be sold cheap, and  
perhaps they may, for less than they cost; but if you have  
no occasion for them, they must be dear to you. Remember  
what Poor Richard says, ‘Buy what thou hast no need of,  
  
  
  
  
  
and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.’ And again,  
‘Ata great pennyworth pause a while;’ he means, that per-  
haps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real; or the  
bargain, by straitening thee in thy business, may do thee:  
more harm than good. For in another place he says, ‘Many  
have been ruined by buying good pennyworths,’ Again,  
‘It is foolish to lay out money in a purchase of repentance ;”  
and yet this folly is practised every day at auctions, for want  
of minding the Almanac. Many a one, for the sake of finery  
on the back, have gone with a hungry belly, and half starved  
their families; ‘Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, put  
out the kitchen fire,’ as Poor Richard says. These are not  
the necessaries of life; they can scarcely be called the con-  
veniences; and yet, only because they look pretty, how  
many want to have them? By these and other extrava-  
gances, the greatest are reduced to poverty, and forced to  
borrow of those whom they formerly despised, but, who,  
through industry and frugality, have maintained their stand-  
ing; in which case it appears plainly, that ‘A ploughman  
on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees,’ as Poor  
Richard says. Perhaps they have had a small estate left.  
them, which they knew not the getting of; they think ‘It is  
day, and will never be night ;’ that a little to be spent out of  
so much is not worth minding; but ‘Always taking out of  
the meal-tub, and never putting in, soon eomes to the bot-  
tom,’ as Poor Richard says; and then, ‘When the well is  
dry, they know the worth of water.’ But this they might  
have known before, if they had taken his adviee. ‘If you  
would know the value of money, go and try to borrow some;  
for he that goes a borrowing, goes a sorrowing,’ as Poor  
Richard says; and, indeed, so does he that lends to such  
people, when he goes to get it again. Poor Dick farther ad-  
vises, and says,  
‘Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse;  
Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.’  
  
And again, ‘Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great  
deal more saucy.’ When you have bought one fine thing,.  
you must buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of  
a piece; but Poor Dick says, ‘It is easier to suppress the first  
desire, than to satisfy all that follow it.’ And it is as truly  
folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to swell, in  
order to equal the ox.  
‘ Vessels large may venture more,  
But little boats should keep near shore.’  
  
It is, however, a folly soon punished; for as poor Richard  
says, ‘Pride that dines on vanity, sups on contempt; Pride  
breakfasted with Plenty, dined with Poverty, and supped  
with Infamy.’ And, after all, of what use is this pride of  
appearance, for which so much is risked, so much is suf-  
fered? It can not promote health, nor ease pain; it makes  
no increase of merit in the person, it creates envy, it hastens.  
misfortune.  
  
*‘But what madness it must be to run in debt for these  
superfluities! We are offered by the terms of this sale six  
months’ credit; and that, perhaps, has induced some of us.  
to attend it, because we can not spare the ready money, and  
hope how to be fine without it. But, ah! think what you  
do when you run in debt; you give to another power over  
your liberty. If you can not pay at the time, you will be  
  
| ashamed to see your creditor; you will be in fear when you  
  
speak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, sneaking ex-  
cuses, and, by degrees, come to lose your veracity, and sink  
into base downright lying; for ‘The second vice is lying,  
the first is runningin debt,’ as Poor Richard says; and  
again, to the same purpose, ‘Lying rides upon debt’s back ;’  
whereas a freeborn Englishman ought not to be ashamed  
nor afraid to see or speak to any man living. But poverty  
often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue. ‘It is hard for  
an empty bag to stand upright.’ What would you think.  
  
  
  
328 CHRISTIANITY IN ART.  
  
  
  
of that prince, or of that government, who should issue an  
edict forbidding you to dress like gentleman or gentlewo-  
man, on pain of imprisonment or servitude? Would you  
not say that you were free, have a right to dress as you  
please, and that such an edict would bea breach of your  
privileges, and such a government tyrannical? and yet  
you are about to put yourself under that tyranny, when  
you run in debt for such dress! Your creditor has author-  
ity, at his pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty, by con-  
fining you in jail for life, or by selling you for a servant,  
if you should not be able to pay him. When you have  
got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of pay-  
ment; but, as Poor Richard says, ‘Creditors have better  
memories than debtors; creditors are a superstitious sect,  
great observers of days and times.’ The day comes round  
before you are aware, and the demand is made before you  
are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in  
nind, the term, which at first seemed so long, will, as  
  
lessens, appear extremely short: Time will seem to have  
vided wings to his heels as well as his shoulders. ‘Those  
aave a short Lent, who owe money to be paid at Easter.’  
At present, perhaps, you may think yourselves in thriving  
circumstances, and that you can bear a little extravagance  
without injury; but  
  
‘For age and want save while you may,  
No morning sun lasts a whole day.’  
  
“Gain may be temporary and uncertain; but ever, while  
you live, expense is constant and certain; and ‘It is easier  
to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel,’ as Poor  
Richard says; so ‘Rather go to bed supperless than rise in  
debt.’  
  
‘Get what you can, and what you get hold,  
Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold.’  
  
And, when you have got the philosopher’s stone, sure you  
will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty of  
paying taxes.  
  
“IV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom;  
but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own indus-  
try, and frugality, and prudence, though excellent things;  
for they may all be blasted without the blessing of Heaven;  
and, therefore, ask that blessing humbly, and be not un-  
charitable to those that at present seem to want it, but com-  
fort and help them. Remember, Job suffered, and was after-  
ward prosperous.  
  
“And now to conclude, ‘Experience keeps a dear school,  
but fools will learn in no other,’ as Poor Richard says, and  
scarce in that; for it is true, ‘We may give advice, but we  
can not give conduct.’ However, remember this, ‘They that  
will not be counselled, can not be helped ;’ and farther, that,  
‘If you will not hear reason, she will surely rap your  
knuckles,’ as Poor Richard says.’’  
  
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people  
heard it, and approved the doctrine, and immediately prac-  
tised the contrary, just as if it had been a common sermon;  
for the auction opened, and they began to buy extrava-  
gantlvy. I found the good man had thoroughly studied my  
Almanac, and digested all I had dropped on these topics dur-  
ing the course of twenty-five years. The frequent mention  
he made of me must have tired any one else; but my vanity  
was wonderfully delighted with it, though I was conscious  
that a tenth part of the wisdom was my own which he as-  
cribed to me; but rather the gleanings that I had made of  
the sense of all ages and nations. However, I resolved  
to be the better for the echo of it; and, though I had at  
first determined to buy stuff for a new coat, I Went  
away, resolved to wear my old one a little longer. Cour-  
teous reader, if thou wilt do the same, thy profit will be as  
great as mine.

“The hour of the sale not being come, they were conversing on

of the times ? Will not these heavy taxes quite ruin the country ?, How  
shall we ever be able to pay them? What would you advise us to do?’  
Father Abraham stood up and replied, ‘If you would have my advice,  
I will give it you in short, for a@ word to the wise is enough, as Poor  
Richard says.’ All the prudential and economical maxims of Poor  
Richard are then quoted with connecting remarks. ‘*The people

MORALITIES.  
No virtue can remain concealed or if  
concealed, it is not virtue’s loss.  
Dost thou love life? Then do not  
squander time, for that is the stuff life  
is made of.  
Choose the company of your super­  
iors whenever you can have it.  
Dews of the night are diamonds at  
morn, so the tears we u&#x27;eep here may  
he pearls in heaven.  
Give me health and a day, and I will  
make the pomp of emperors ridiculous.  
The one secret of tranquility is first  
to trust in the Lord and then to do  
good.

he say3: &quot;I stopped my horse lately  
where a large number of people were  
collected at an auction of merchant goods,  
the hour of the sale not being come they  
were conversing on the badness of the  
limes, and one of the company called to  
a plain, clean old man, with white locks:  
&quot;Pray, father Abraham, what think you  
of the times? Will not ihese heavy  
taxes quite ruin the country ? How shall  
we ever be able to pay them? What  
would you advise us to do?&quot; Fatbet  
Abraham&#x27; stood up and replied : If you  
would have my advice, I will give it to  
you in short, for a word to the wise is  
enough, as Poor Richard says. &quot;Friends,&quot;  
says he, &quot;the taxes are indeed very  
heavy, and if those laid on by the govern?  
ment were the only ones we had to pay  
we could more easily discbarge them;  
but we have many others and much more  
grievous to some of us. We are taxed  
twice as much by our idleness, three  
times as much by our pride and four  
times as much by our folly, and from  
these taxes the Commissioners cannot  
ease or deliver us by allowing an abate?  
ment. However, let us harken to good  
advice, and something may be done for  
us. God helps those who helps them?  
selves, as Poor Richard says. It would  
be thought a hard government that would  
tax its people one-tenth part of their  
time to be employed in its service, but  
idleness taxes many of us more. So  
what signifies wishing and hoping for  
better times ? We may make these better  
if we bestir ourselves. Industry need  
not wish, and he that lives upon hope  
will die fasting. He that hath a trade  
bath an estate, and he that hath a calling  
hath an office of honor and profit, as  
Poor Richard says; but then the trade  
must be worked at and the calling well  
followed, or neither the estate nor the  
office will enable us to pay our taxes.&quot;

Pleasure is a shadow, wealth is vanity.  
The tears of penitents are the wine of  
angels.  
The virtues are lost in self-interest, as

POOR RICHARD&#x27;S SAYINGS.  
Benjamin Franklin published an  
almanac in 1757 from which I cull the  
following:  
.. TAXES.  
The taxes are indeed very heavy,  
and if those laid on by the govern­  
ment were the only ones we had to  
pay we might the more easily discharge  
them; but we have many others, and  
much more grievous to some of us.  
We are taxed twice as much by our  
idleness, three times as much by our  
pride and four times as much by our  
folly; and from these taxes the com­  
missioners cannot deliver us.  
It would be thought a hard govern­  
ment that should tax its people one­  
tenth part of their .time to be employed  
in its service, &#x27;but idleness taxes many  
of us much more, if we reckon all  
that is spent in absolute sloth, or doing  
of nothing; with that which is spent  
in idle employments or amusements  
that amount to nothing. Sloth, by  
bringing on disease, absolutely short­  
ens life. Sloth, like rust, consumes  
faster than labor wears. Dost thou  
love life ? then do not squander time,  
for that&#x27;s the stuff life is made of.  
Sloth makes all things difficult, but  
industry all things easy.  
Laziness travels so slowly thatpov­  
erty soon overtakes him.  
What signifies wishing and hoping  
for better times ? We make times  
better if we bestir ourselves.  
Industry need not wish. !  
LEISURE.  
Methinks I hear some of you say  
&quot; Must a man afford himself noliesure?  
I will tell thee: Employ thy time well,  
if thou meanest to gain &quot;leisure; and  
inceithiiul; x&amp;&amp;xu&amp;!i!3 miasms  
throw not away an hour:&#x27; r  
Leisure is the time for doing some­  
thing useful. This leisure the dilli­  
gent man will obtain, but the lazy  
man never. A life of leisure and a  
life of idleness are two things. Do  
you imagine that sloth will afford you  
more comfort than labor? Trouble  
springs from idleness and grievous toil  
from needless ease. Many, without  
labor, would live by their wits only,  
but they&#x27;ll break for want of stock.  
Industry gives comfort and plenty  
and respect

Judge, then, how I must have beeu  
gratified by au iucideut I am goiug to  
relate to yon. I stopped my horse late­  
1&gt;, where a great number ol&#x27; people were  
collected at an auction of a merchant&#x27;s  
goods. The hour of the sale not beiug  
come, they were conversing ou the bad­  
  
noss of the times ; aud one of the com  
pany called to a plain, clean, old man,  
with white locks, &quot;pray, lather Abra­  
ham, what think you of tho time 1 \\ ill  
not tliosp heavy taxes quite ruin the  
country &#x27;! How shall we ever be able to  
pay themï What would you advise  
to ?&quot; Father Abraham stood up and re­  
plied, &quot;if you would have my advice, I  
will give it toyou in short ;for a word to  
the wise i* enough, as poor Richard says.&quot;  
They joined in desiring him to speak  
his mind, and gathering round him, he  
proceeded as follows: &quot;Friend,&quot; said  
he,&quot;the taxes are indeed very heavy,  
and, it those laid on by the government  
were the only oues wo had to pay, we  
might more easily discharge them ; but  
we have many others, and much more  
tfiicvous to some of us. We ate taxed  
twice as much by our idleuess, three  
times as much by our pride, and four  
times as much by our folly; aud lrom  
these taxes the commissioners cannot  
ease or deliver us, by allowing an abate­  
ment. However, let us hearken to good  
advice, and something may be done for  
us. (Hod helps them that help themselves,  
as poor Richard says.&quot;  
&quot;First, it would be thought a hard  
government that should tax its people  
one tenth part of their time, to be em­  
ployed in its service? but idleness taxes  
many ol&#x27; us much more : Sloth, by  
bringing on diseases, absolutely short­  
ens life.  
Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than  
labor wear8 ; while the used hey is always  
bright, as poor Richard says. But dost  
thou love life, then do not squander time,  
for that is the stuff life is made of, as  
poor Riehaid says.  
How much more than is uecessaiy do  
we spend in sleep, forgetting that, the  
sleeping fox catchcs no poultry, and that  
there will be sleepiug enough in the  
grave, as poor Richard says  
If time be of all things the most pre­  
cious, wasting time must be, as poor Rich­  
  
ard says, the greatest prodigality ; since,  
as he elsewhere tells us, lost timers nev­  
er found again ; and what we call time  
enough, always proves little enough.  
Let us then up and be doing, and  
doing to the purpose ; so by diligence  
shall we do more with less perplexity.  
Sloth makes all things difficult, but  
industry all easy ; and he that riseth  
late must trot all day, and shall scarce  
overtake his business at night; while  
laziness travels so slowly, that poverty  
soon overtakes him. Drive thy busi­  
ness, let not that drive thee ; and, early  
to bed and early to rise, makes man  
healthy, wealthy and wise, as poor  
Richard says.  
So what signifies wishing and hoping  
for better times? We may make these  
times better, if we bestir ourselves  
Industry need not wish, and he that  
lives upon hopes will die fasting.  
There are no gains without pains ; then  
help, hands, for I have uo lands ; or, if  
I have, they are smaitly taxed.  
He that hath a trade, hath an estate;  
aud he that hath a calling, hath an office  
of profit and honor, as poor Richard says;  
butthen tho trade must be worked at,  
aud the calling followed, or neither the  
estate nor the office will enable us to  
pay our taxes.  
If we are industrious, we shall never  
starve; for, at the workingman&#x27;s house  
hnuger looks iü, but dares not enter.  
Nor will the bailiff, or, the constable  
enter; for, industry pays debts, while  
despair iucreaseth them. What though  
yon have found no treasure, nor has any  
rich relation left you a legacy, diligence  
is the mother of good lack, and God  
gives all things to industry. Then,  
plough deep while sluggards sleep, and  
you shall have corn to sell aud to keep.  
Work while it is called to-day, for you  
know uot how much you may be hin­  
dered to-morrow.  
One to-day is worth two to-morrows,  
as poor Richard says; and further,  
never leave that till to-morrow, which  
you can do to-day.  
If you were a servant, would you uot  
be ashamed that a good master should  
catch you idle ? Are you then your own  
master? Be ashamed to catch yourself  
idle, when there is so much to be done  
for yourself, your family, your country,  
aud your King. Handle your tools  
without mittens. Remember, that, the  
cat in gloves catches no mice, as poor  
Richard says.  
It is true there is much to be done,  
and perhaps you are weak handed ; but  
stick to it steadily, and you will see  
great, effects; for, constant dropping  
wears away stones; and, by diligence  
aud patience the mouse ate in two  
pieces the cable ; and, little strokes fell  
great oaks.  
Methiuks T hear some of you say  
&quot;must a man afford himself no leisure!&quot;  
I will tell thee, my friend, what poor  
Richard says: Employ thy time well,  
if thou meanest to gain leisure; and,  
since thou art not sure of a minute,  
throw not away an hour. Leisure is  
&#x27; ^&#x27; miî * 01 ( t°ing something useful ; this  
j leisure the diligent man will obtain, but  
the lazy man never; for, a life of leisure  
and a life of laziness are two things  
Many, without labor, would live by their  
wits only, but they break for want of  
stock. Whereas, industry gives com­  
fort and plenty, and respect. Fly pleas­  
ures, and they will follow you. The  
diligent spinner has a large shift; and.  
now j | liive a sheep and a cow, every­  
&#x27;&quot;&gt;«.v W. « «ooa morrow But will,  
our industry, we must likewise be  
  
steady, settled, and careful, and oversee  
our own affairs, with our own eyes, and  
not trust too much to others; for, as  
poor Richard says,  
&quot;I never saw au oft removed tree,  
Nor yet au oft removed family, ,,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.  
Aud again, three removes are as bad  
as a fire ; aud agaiu, keep thy shop, and  
thy shop will keep thee ; and again, if  
you would have your business done, go ;  
if not, send. Aud agaiu,  
He that by the plough would thrive,  
Himself must either hold or drive.  
And again, the eye of the master will  
do more work than both his hands; and  
again, waut of care docs us tuore dam­  
age than waut of knowledge ; and  
again, not to oversee workmen, is to  
leave them your purse open.  
Trusting too much to others care is  
the ruin of many ; for, in the affairs of  
this world men are saved, not by faith,  
j ljnt tlio want of it.  
Rut a man&#x27;s own care is profitable ;  
for, if you would have a faithful sei­  
vaut, aud one that you like, serve your­  
self.  
  
A little neglect may breed great mis- |  
chief ; for want of a nail the shoe was  
lost; for want of a shoe tho horse was  
lost; and for want of a hotse thoiidei  
was lost, being overtaken and slain by  
the enemy ; all for want ot a little care  
about a horse shoe nail.  
So much foi industry, my frieuds,  
and atteutiou to one&#x27;s own business :  
but to these we must add frugality, il  
we would make our industry more cci­  
taiuly successful. A man may, if lie  
knows not how to save if he gets, keep  
his tiose all his life to the grind stone,  
and die uot worth a groat at last.  
A fat kitchen makes a lean will ; and  
Many oatates are spout in the getting,  
Sine© wouldu for taa, fovaook apinniug; aim  
knitting,  
And men for punch forsook hewing ami split  
ting.&quot;  
If you would bo wealthy, think ot  
saving as well as getting. 1 lie Indies  
have not made Spain rich, because her  
out-goes are greater than her incomes.

[l)R. FRANKLIN CONTINUED.]  
Away then with your expensive fol- j  
lies, and you w ill not, then have so much j  
cause to complain of hard times, heavy I  
taxes, and chargable families ; for,  
Women mill \\:ne,£ une and deeeit,  
Makel In* wraith small and tin*, want j^reat. !  
And furtiier, w hat maintains one vice  
would bring up two children.  
Von may think, perhaps, that a little j  
tea, or a little punch now and then, diet  
a little more costly, clothes a little finer,  
and a little entertainment now and  
then, can be no great matter; but re­  
member, many a little makes a mickle.  
Beware of little expenses. A small  
leak will sink a great ship, as poor  
Richard says ; and again, who dainties  
love, shall beggers prove; and more­  
over, fools make feasts, and wise men  
eat them.  
Here you are all got together at this  
sale of tinei ies and nick-nacks.  
You call them goods ; but, if you do  
not take cart , they will prove evils to  
some of you You expect they will bo  
sold|cheap, and perhaps they may sell for  
less than they cost ; but, it you have no  
occasion for them, they must be dear to  
you.  
Remember what poor Richard says:  
Buy w hat thou has no need of, and ere  
long thou shall, sell thy necessaries.  
And again, at a great pennyworth  
pause a w hile. He means, that perhaps  
the cheapness is apparent only, and not  
real : oi the bargain, by straightening  
thee in thy business, may do thee more  
liaim than good. For in anothei place,  
he says, many have been ruined by  
buy ing good penny worths. Again, it is  
foolish to lay out money in a purchase  
of repentance; and yet this folly is  
piacticed evi-tyday at auction, foi want  
of minding the almanac. Many a one  
for the sake of linci v on the back, have  
■rone wiili a hungry belly and half  
starved their families. Silks and satins,  
seal let .nui velvets, pin out the kitchen  
tire, as poor Richard says. These are  
not the nt cess,11 ies of life; they can  
scarce!v be called the. conveniences.  
And  
how  
thest  
r&#x27;et, only becan

By  
the  
u reduced to poverty, and  
borrow of those whom they  
despised, but who, through  
toi frugality, have maintained  
their standing ; in which ease it appears  
plainly, that a ploughman on his legs is  
bight l than a gentleman on Iiis knees,  
as poor Richard says.  
Peihaps they have had a small estate  
left them, which they knew not the get­  
ting of ; they think, it is day, and will  
never be night. That a little to be  
spent out of so much is not v oi th mind­  
ing ; but, always taking out of the meal  
tub, and never putting in,soon comes to  
the bot tom, as poor Richard says; and  
then, when the well is dry, they know  
the worth of water. But this they  
might have know n before, if they had  
taken his ad vice. If you would know  
the value ot money, go and try to bor­  
row some; for he that goes a borrowing  
goes a sorrowing, as pooi Richard says.  
And indeed so does he that lends to  
such people, when he goes to set it iu  
again.  
Poor Dick  
to  
go  
ad vn  
and  
fin thei  
Fond pride ol&#x27; &lt;lit s-. i- sure ,i very curse :  
Lie fancy yon consult, consult your purse.  
And again, pride is as loud a begger  
as want, and a great, deal more saucy.  
When you have bought one tine thing  
you must buy ten more, that your ap­  
pearance may be all ot a price ; but poor  
Dick says, it is easier to suppress the  
first desire, than to satisfy all that fol­  
low it.  
And it is as tiuly folly for the poor to  
ape the rich, as for the frog to swell in  
order to equal the ox.  
  
Vessels targe may venture more,  
lint little boats should keep near shore.  
It is, however, a folly soon punished .  
for, as poor Richard says, pride that  
dines on vanity, sups on contempt.  
Pride breakfasted with plenty, dined  
with poverty, and supped with infamy.  
And, after all, of what use is this  
pride of appearance, for which su much  
is risked, so much is suffered? It can­  
not promote health, nor ease pain; it  
makes no increase of merit in the per­  
son ; it creates envy ; it hastens misfor­  
tune. But, what madness must it be to  
run in debt for these superfluities 1  
We are offered, by the terms of this  
sale, six months of credit ; and that,  
perhaps, has induced some of us to at­  
tend it, because we cannot spare the  
ready money, and hope now to be fine  
without it. But, ah ! think what you  
do when you run iu debt ; you give to  
another power over your liberty. If you  
cannot pay at the time, you will be  
ashamed to see your creditor; you will  
be in fear when you speak to him , you  
will make poor, pitiful, sneaking ex­  
cuses, and, by degrees, come to lose  
your veracity, and sink into base, down  
right lying ; for the second vice is lying  
the first is running in debt, as poor  
Richard says.  
And again, to the same purpose, lying  
rides upon debt&#x27;s back ; whereas, a  
free born Englishman ought not to be  
ashamed nor afraid to see or to speak to  
any man living. But poverty often de­  
prives a man of all spirit and virtue.  
Il is hard for an empty bag to stand up­  
right.  
What would you think of that Prince,  
or of that Government, who should is­  
sue an edict forbidding yon to dress like  
a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain  
of imprisonment or servitude? Would  
yon not say that you were free, have a  
right to dress as you please, and that  
such an edict would be a breach of your  
privileges, and such a government  
tyrannical? And yet you are about to  
put yourself under such tyranny, when  
you run in debt for such dress! Your  
creditor has authority, at his pleasure,  
to deprive you of your liberty, by con­  
fining yon in jail until you shall be able  
to pay him. When you have got your  
bargain, you may, perhaps, ^tliink little  
of payment ; but, as poor Richard says,  
creditors have better memories than  
debtors ; creditors are a superstitious  
sect, great observers of set days and  
times. The day comes round before  
you are aware, and the demand is made  
before you are prepared to satisfy it »  
or, if you bear your debt in mind, the  
nov T &amp;î§tL 0 flfe. wi11 ,  
  
Time will seem to have added wings  
to his heels as well as his shoulders.  
Those have a short lent, who owe  
money to be paid at easier.  
At present, perhaps, you may think  
yourselves in thriving circumstances,  
and that you can bear a little extiava  
gance w ithout injury ; but,  
For age sincl want save while you make ;  
No morning&#x27;s sun lasts a whole itiiy.  
Gain may be temporary and uncer­  
tain, but ever, while you live, expenses I  
constant and certain ; and, it is easier to  
build two chimuies, than to keep one in  
fuel, as poor Richa&#x27;d says: so, lathei  
go to bed suppcrless, than to rise in  
debt.  
Get what you can, and what you get,  
hold. &#x27;Tis the stone that w ill turn all  
your lead into gold. And, when \nu  
have got the philosopher&#x27;s stone, sine  
your will&#x27;no longer complain ol bad  
times, or the difficulty ol paying bail  
taxes.  
This doctrine, my friends, is reason  
and wisdom ; but, after all, do not de­  
pend too much upon your own in.liistiy,  
and frugality, and prudence,though ex­  
cellent things; for they may all be  
blasted, without the blessing &lt;&gt;! Heav­  
en ; and, therefore, ask that blcs.-ing  
humbly, and be not uncharitable to  
those that at present seem to want it,  
but comfort and help them. Remem­  
ber, Job suffered, and was atterwaids  
prosperous. And now, to conclude, ex­  
perience keeps a dear school, but tool,-,  
will learn in no other, as pooi Richaid  
says, aud scarce in that, tor, it is tine,  
we may give advice, but we cannot give  
conduct. However, remember &#x27;his,  
they that will not be counselled, cannot  
be helped. And further, that, it &gt;&quot;ii  
will not lieai reason, she will sinel\ iap  
you knuckles, as pool Richard savs.  
Thus the old gentleman ended his  
liaiangue. The people heard it, and  
approved the doctrine , and iuiin. finite­  
ly practiced the contrary, just ;is il n  
had been a common sermon; loi the  
auction opened and they began to bid ex­  
travagantly. 1 found the g.nul man had  
thorougly studied my almanacs, aud di­  
gested all 1 had dropped on these topics  
timing t he com se ol twenty-live years.  
The 111 quellt mention lie made ot me  
must have tired anyone else; but my  
vanity was woudertolly delighted with  
it, though I was conscious that not a  
tenth part of the wisdom was m&gt; own,  
which he ascribed to me, but lather the  
gleanings that 1 had made of all ages  
and nations. However, 1 resolved to be  
the better for the echo ol it ; anil,  
though I had at first determined to btt\
stuff for a new coat, 1 went away le­  
solved to wear my old one a little long­
