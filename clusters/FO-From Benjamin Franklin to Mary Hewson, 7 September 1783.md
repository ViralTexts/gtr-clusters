.  
With regard to the future Establishment of your Children, which you say you want to  
consult me about, I am still of Opinion that America will afford you more Chances of  
doing it well than England. All the means of good Education are plenty there, the  
general Manners more simple &amp; pure, Temptations to Vice and Folly fewer, the Profits  
of Industry in Business as great and sure as in England; and there is one Advantage more  
which your Command of Money will give you there, I mean the laying out a Part of your  
Fortune in new Land, now to be had extreamly cheap, but which must be increas’d  
immensely in Value before your Children come of Age, by the rapid Population of the  
Country. If you should arrive there while I live, you know you may depend on every  
Assistance in my Power to afford you, and I think my Children will have a Pleasure too  
in serving their Father’s Friend. I do not offer it as a Motive that you will be much  
esteem’d and respected there, for that you are &amp; must be every where; but give me  
leave to flatter myself that my being made happier in my last Years by your  
Neighbourhood and Society, may be some Inducement to you.
