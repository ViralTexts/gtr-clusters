Filling the sky and the earth below;<br/>
Over the house-tops, over the street,<br/>
Over the heads of the people you meet;<br/>
Dancing,<br/>
Flirting,<br/>
Skimming along.<br/>
Beautiful snow! it can do nothing wrong;<br/>
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek:<br/>
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,<br/>
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,<br/>
Pure as an angel and fickle as love!<br/>
<br/>
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!<br/>
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!<br/>
Whirling about in its maddening fun,<br/>
It plays in its glee with every one,<br/>
Chasing,<br/>
Laughing,<br/>
Hurrying by.<br/>

And even the dogs with a bark and a bound,<br/>

Ringing,<br/>
Swinging,<br/>
Dashing they go.<br/>
Over the crest of the beautiful snow,<br/>
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,<br/>
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;<br/>
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet<br/>
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;<br/>
Fell, like the snow-flakes, from heaven—to hell!<br/>
Fell, to be trampled as the filth of the street;<br/>
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,<br/>
Pleading,<br/>
Cursing,<br/>
Dreading to die<br/>
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,<br/>
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,<br/>
Hating the living and fearing the dead.<br/>
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?<br/>
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow!<br/>
<br/>
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,<br/>
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow;<br/>
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—<br/>
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face,<br/>
Father,<br/>
Mother,<br/>
Sisters all,<br/>
God and myself, I have lost by my fall.<br/>
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by<br/>
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh,<br/>
For of all that is on or about me, I know,<br/>
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful snow.<br/>
<br/>
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow<br/>
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!<br/>
How strange it would be, when the night comes again,<br/>
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!<br/>
Fainting,<br/>
Freezing,<br/>
Dying alone!<br/>
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan<br/>
To be heard in the crash of this crazy town.<br/>
Gone mad in their joy at the snow coming down,<br/>
To lie and to die in my terrible wo,<br/>
With a bed and a shroud of beautiful snow!<br/>

snow! it can do nothing wrong: Flying to<br/>

humour and song! How the gay sledges<br/>

moment then lost to the eye; Singing,<br/>
Swinging, Dashing they go Over the crust<br/>
of the beautiful snow; Snow so pure when<br/>
it falls from the sky, To be trampled iu<br/>
mud by the crowd rushing by, To be<br/>
trampled and tracked by the thousands of<br/>
feet, Till it blends with the horrible<br/>
filth of the street. Once I was pure as<br/>

Merciful God, have I fallen so low? And<br/>

Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,<br/>

Will take a wide sweep lest I wander too<br/>

Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,<br/>
With an eye like a crystal and a heart<br/>

innocent grace, Flattered and sought for<br/>
the charms of my face! Father, mother,<br/>

so pure as the beautiful snow. How<br/>
strange it should be that this beautiful<br/>
snow Should fall on a sinner with<br/>
nowhere to go ! How strange it should be<br/>
when the night comes again If the snow<br/>
and the ice struck my desperate brain !<br/>
Fainting-freezing-dying alone ! Too<br/>
wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan<br/>
To be heard in the streets of the crazy<br/>
town, Gone mad in the joy of the snow<br/>
