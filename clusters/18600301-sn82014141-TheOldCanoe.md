**THE OLD CANOE.**  
  
**BY EMILY R. PAGE.**  
  
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,    
And the waters below look dark and deep;    
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,    
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;    
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,    
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;    
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day thro&#x27;,    
Lies at its mooring, the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,    
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lopped,    
And crossed on the railing one o&#x27;er one,    
Like folded hands when the work is done;    
While busily back and forth between,    
The spider stretches his silvery screen,    
And the solemn owl with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;    
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,    
Rots slowly away, in its living grave;    
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,    
Hiding the mouldering dust away,    
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,    
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;    
While many a blossom of loveliest hue    
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
The current waters are dead and still,    
But the light winds play with the boat at will;    
And lazily in and out again,    
It floats the length of the rusty chain,    
Like the weary march of the hands of time,    
That meet and part at the noontide chime;    
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew    
By the dipping bow of the old canoe.  
  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,    
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,    
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,    
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,    
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,    
And looked below in the broken tide,    
To see that the faces and boats were two,    
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
  
But now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,    
And look below in the sluggish tide,    
The face that I see there is graver grown,    
And the laugh that I hear has a sobered tone,    
And the hand that lent to the light skiff wings    
Have grown familiar with sterner things;    
But I love to think of the hours that flew,    
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,    
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green moss grew,    
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

THE OLD CANOE.  
  
BY MISS EMILY 3B. PAGE.  
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through—  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddies are idly dropped,  
  
Like a sea-bird’s wing that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing one o’er one,  
  
Like the folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
  
And the solemn ow), with his dull ‘ too-hoo,’  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
  
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
  
Like the hand that piants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower ;  
  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of old canoe.  
  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime ;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,  
By the Gripping bow of the old cance.  
  
O, many a time, with a careless hand,  
  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick—  
Where the whirls are wild, and the eddies are thick—  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew  
O’er the mouldering stern of the old canoe

The Old Canoe.  
  
The following beautiful lines have been going the  
rounds of newspaperdom for several years without  
credit. Whoever the author is, und we confess  
our inability to name him, he should claim the  
wandering progeny of his brain, as they are worthy  
of the palmiest days of genuine poetry :  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep.  
And the waters below look dark and deep ;  
Where the ragged pine, in its lonely pride.  
Leans gloomily over the murky aide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank.  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lays at its mooring the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lop&#x27;d.  
And crossed on the railing one o&#x27;er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is done ;  
While busily back and forth between.  
The spider stretches his silver screen ;  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-whoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave.  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower ;  
While many a blossom of liveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The cnrrentless waters are dead and still ;  
But the light winds play with the boat at will;  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of its rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime ;  
And the shore in kissed at each turn anew.  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
0 many a time, with a careless hand,  
1 have pulled it away from the bebbly strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild aud the eddies thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below iu the broken tide.  
To see that the faces and boat were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now as 1 leejj o&#x27;er tlie crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide.  
The face that I see there is graver grown.  
And the laugh that I hear has a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to tiiiuk of fie hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew,

And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the ragged pine in its lonely pride.

Where the reek and rushes are tall and rank.  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow la heavy the whole day through.  
Lay at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped.  
Like a seabird&#x27;s wings that the storm had lopped,  
And crossed on the railings, one o’er one.  
Like folded hands when the work ia done:  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches her silver screen.  
And the solemn owl, with his dull ‘too-hoo,”  
Settles down oa the side of the old canoe.

I hare pushed it away from the pebbly strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirles are wild and the eddies are thick.  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boat* were two,

But now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown.  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  
But I luve to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray threw.  
Ere the blossoms waved or the green grass grew

THE OLD CANOE.  
We take great pleasure in reproducing this ex­  
quisite poem, cut many years ago from an obscure  
Arkansas paper, and published in the North.—  
Every now and then it re-appears on the surface of  
newspaper literature. It desires a more prominent  
place in our letters :  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
&#x27; And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The uselesss paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done ;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tonib a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;  
While many a blossom of the loveliest hue,  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waves are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the wenry march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime.  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew.  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
O, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand ;  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,

Foetry.  
For the Spectator.  
The River.  
Be still, ever flowing, never quiet, river,  
Cease to upbraid me as you hurry along;  
Taunt me no longer with joys gone forever,  
Hush, O ! hush thy sorrowful and mournful song.  
But ever receding and never heeding,  
The cruel river with my hopes is fleeting.  
Away! Away! with memories of the past,  
Divide me no longer with fears that have fled,  
Bury all the happiness that could not last,  
Hide, O! hide the hopes and desires that are  
dead.  
But ever and on the river is flowing,  
Heedless of all my agony, is going.  
_#-. .  
The Old Canoe.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep :  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank,  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day thro&#x27;  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Nestles down on the side of the old can«e.  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding the moldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles a fallen tower;  
While many a blossom of liveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern ofthe old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light winds play with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream ran quick,  
Where the whirls were wild and the storm was  
thick;  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the brokeji tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide  
The face that I see is graver grown,  
And the laugh I heard has a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things ;  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray  
threw;  
Ere the blossoms moved or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the moldering stern ofthe old canoe.

And paddled it down where tho stream runs  
quick,  
Where the whirls arc wild, and the eddies are

And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,

by Miss Hjelm,&quot; exclaimed: &quot;Am I awake

&quot;Geb! Geb! Y&#x27;es; but who is Geb?&quot; asked

&quot;Who but ingeborg? Is it not the second

&quot;Oh!&quot; cried the judge, embracing her.  
&quot;I have indeed had more lack than wit.&quot;

THE HO0E CIRCLE.  
THE OLD CANOE.  
ALBERT PIKE.  
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
There lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a seabird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl with the dull &quot; too-whoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave;  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er his dull decay  
Hiding its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er a tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of lovliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
But the twilight wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noonday chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time with ceaseless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wide and the eddies are thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear is a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familar with sterner things;  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray  
shed,  
Ere the blossoms waved or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

pure and unbroken as a mirror, with its wooded shores gleam-  
ing aloft in unnumbered hues and unrivalled radiance, which  
autumn nowhere sbeds with so lavish a hand as in an Amer-  
ican woods, and sleeping below, reflected to the smallest leaf  
on the calm surface of the water. Attached to the bridge by  
a long chain was an old waterlogged canoe, which had once  
been used as a fishing boat, but now it was almost ready to  
fall to pieces from old age :—  
“ The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
  
Rots slowly away in its living grave ;  
  
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,  
  
Hiding the mouldering dust away. .  
  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower ;  
  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
  
Springs o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
“ The currentless waters are dead and still,  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will ;  
And lazily, in and out again,  
  
It floats tne length of the ruaty chain,  
  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime.  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.”  
  
The air was breathless, yet so pure and fresh that the brisk-  
est breeze that ever fanned the ocean came not more grate-  
fully to the cheek and brow than that delicious calm in which  
the most delicate leaf alone might be seen to quiver, while all  
the other foliage hung motionless and voiceless. Away off,  
on a tall, leafless tree, sat, solitary and alone, a huge fish-  
hawk, looking down over his demesne of wood and water

Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are

The Old Canoe—Emily Rebecca Page  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank,  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lies at the moorings the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
  
Like a sea-bird’s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o’er one,  
  
Like the folded hands when the work is done,  
While busily back and forth between,  
  
The spider stretches his silvery screen ;  
  
And the solemn owl, with his dull “ too-hoo,”  
Settles down on the sides of the old canoe.  
  
The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave,  
  
Rots slowly in its living grave,  
  
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;  
  
While many a blossom of the loveliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noon-tide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew  
  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
  
Many a time, with careless hand  
  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick—  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick—  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,  
  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things ;  
  
But I love to think of the hours that flew  
  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew  
O’er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

To the westering sun the colors run  
Through the deeps of the ripening wheat.  
  
O glorious land! My Western land,  
Outspread beneath the setting sun!  
Once more amid your swells I stand,  
And cross your sod lands dry and dun,  
I hear the jocund calls of men  
Who sweep amid the ripened grain  
With swift, stern reapers, once again.

ath and hereafter it will  
not be necessary to send to other  
places for the lath used here. The  
shingle mill is being kept busy and its  
sharp, quick “zip” can be heard as it  
cuts out thousands of shingles for  
home comsu motion.  
These mills furnish work for many  
men and help make times lively in

Our Town Assessment All Right.  
The city attorney was notified last  
Saturday by County Clerk Davis that  
the town tax assessment hail been put  
upon the tax book and was all O, K.  
This action was taken as a result of  
an opinion handed down by a couple  
of eminent jurists of Little Rock.  
  
The Old Canoe.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is  
steep.  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Imre the reeds and the rushes are long and  
lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding  
bank,  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day  
through,  
There lies at is mooring the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are Idly dropped,  
Like the sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has  
lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o’er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work i» done,  
While busily back and forth between.  
The spider stretches his silvery screen  
And the solemn owl with the dull &quot;too  
whoo,”  
Settles down on the edge of the old eanoe.  
The stem half sunk iri the slimy wave,  
Hots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss ereap o’er Its dull decay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust swev.  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a  
flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower,  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue.  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
Hut the twilight wind plays with the boat at  
will.  
And lazily in and out again,  
It floats the length of the rusty chain ;  
Like the weary march of the hand of time.  
That meet and part at the noon tide chime,  
  
And the shore is kissed nt each turning  
anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time with careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream runs  
quick.  
Where the whirls are wide and the eddies are  
thick.  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that faces and imats were two  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
And look below hi the sluggish tide.  
The face that I see there is graver grown.  
And the laugh that I hear is a sober tone.  
Tlie bands that lent to the light skiff wings.  
Have grown familiar with sterner things:  
But 1 love to think of the hours that sped,  
As 1 rocked where the whirls their white spray  
shed.

grew,
