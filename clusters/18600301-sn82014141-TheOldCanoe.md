**THE OLD CANOE.**  
  
**BY EMILY R. PAGE.**  
  
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,    
And the waters below look dark and deep;    
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,    
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;    
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,    
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;    
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day thro&#x27;,    
Lies at its mooring, the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,    
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lopped,    
And crossed on the railing one o&#x27;er one,    
Like folded hands when the work is done;    
While busily back and forth between,    
The spider stretches his silvery screen,    
And the solemn owl with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;    
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,    
Rots slowly away, in its living grave;    
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,    
Hiding the mouldering dust away,    
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,    
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;    
While many a blossom of loveliest hue    
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
The current waters are dead and still,    
But the light winds play with the boat at will;    
And lazily in and out again,    
It floats the length of the rusty chain,    
Like the weary march of the hands of time,    
That meet and part at the noontide chime;    
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew    
By the dipping bow of the old canoe.  
  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,    
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,    
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,    
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,    
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,    
And looked below in the broken tide,    
To see that the faces and boats were two,    
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
  
But now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,    
And look below in the sluggish tide,    
The face that I see there is graver grown,    
And the laugh that I hear has a sobered tone,    
And the hand that lent to the light skiff wings    
Have grown familiar with sterner things;    
But I love to think of the hours that flew,    
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,    
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green moss grew,    
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

ctral fleet  
Of the icebergs round them meet,  
Pressing closer till they sunk crashing to the  
deep?-  
Do these crystal mountains loom,  
Monuments for that vast tomb  
In the Ocean&#x27;s quiet depths where so many sleep?  
O thou ever surging sea,  
Vainly do we question thee:  
The blue waves no answer bring as they kiss the  
strand,  
But we know each coral grave,  
Far beneath the rolling wave,  
Shall at last give up its dead touched by God&#x27;s

THE OLD CANOE.  
  
BY MISS EMILY 3B. PAGE.  
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through—  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddies are idly dropped,  
  
Like a sea-bird’s wing that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing one o’er one,  
  
Like the folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
  
And the solemn ow), with his dull ‘ too-hoo,’  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.

The following lines, which we clip from the 4r-  
kansas State Garette, are full of genuine poetry:  
The OlD Canee.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Loans gloomily over the murky tide:  
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lays at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles areidly dropped,  
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lepped,  
And crosed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Lke folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too hoo,  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay.  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;  
While many a blossom of liveliest hue  
Bprings up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and stili  
Bat the light winds play with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
It fleats the length of its rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canos.  
O, many a time with a careless hand  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick  
Where the whiris are wild and the eddies are thick  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that tho faces and boats were two,  
hat were mirrered back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the slugglish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings, I  
Have grown familiar with sterner things,  
But I love to think of the hours that fiew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray threw,  
Are the blonsoms waved, or the green grass grew

I have pushed it away from the pébbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs

Where the whirls aro wild and the eddies are  
thick-  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To seesthat the faces of the boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoc.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side;  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray  
threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

The Old Canoe.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep ;  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride.  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where the shadaw is heavy the whole day through  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lopped,  
  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is done ;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches hia silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rota slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles a fallen tower;  
While many a blossom of liveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless wafers are dead and still  
But the light winds play with the boat at will.  
And lazily in and out again.  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of Time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew.  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
0, many a time with a careless hand  
1 have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick.  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,

And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and bouts were two. .  
Bnt now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a sober tone.  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings.  
Have grown familiar with sterner things ;  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where tlie whirls their wild spray  
threw,

THE OLD CANOE.  
We take great pleasure in reproducing this ex­  
quisite poem, cut many years ago from an obscure  
Arkansas paper, and published in the North.—  
Every now and then it re-appears on the surface of  
newspaper literature. It desires a more prominent  
place in our letters :  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
&#x27; And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The uselesss paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done ;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tonib a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;  
While many a blossom of the loveliest hue,  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waves are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the wenry march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime.  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew.  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
O, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand ;  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,

And now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,

And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skill&#x27; wings,

Nestles down on the side of the old canoe.

Lke the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time with a careless hand  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And piddled it down where the streamn ran quick,  
Where the whirls were wild and the storm was  
thick;  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I heard has a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff win  
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray  
threw,  
Ere the blossoms moyed or the green grass gre

Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep.  
And the waters below look dark and deep.  
Where the rugged rine in its lonely pride

Where the reeds and rushes ars tall and rank,

And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay.

But the light winds play with the boat at will  
And lazily in and out again.

SOMERSET, PA. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1875.  
  
THE OLD CANOE.  
 eeeeeee eae  
The following fine verses appeared  
anonymously some years ago in a pa-  
per at Little Rock, Arkansas. The  
writter could have well afforded to  
give his or her name with it.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide:  
Where the reeds and the rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
There lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done:  
While busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches his silver screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of lovilest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoc.  
The currentless waters are dead and still  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below at the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wing  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray shed,  
Ere the blossom waved, or the green grass grew,  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

lf the social questions that vex our  
souls will be answered when the world  
concedes that a woman is a normal, re  
sponsible individual; that she must be  
the protector of her own honor, the  
judge of her own duty, the keeper of  
her own conscience, answerable only to  
the law and to heaven. There will be a  
lofty observance of marriage, a noble  
race of children, only when the man  
and woman are intelligent equals and  
friends. And in that day the world  
will be ashamed to remember through  
how many centuries it ranged men into  
a mock order of devotees and women  
into a sentimental priact?

The Old Cance.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is  
steep,  
And the waters blow look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rnshes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding  
bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day  
through,  
There lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a seabird&#x27;s wings that the storm has  
lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folden hands when the work is done:  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solmn owl, with his dull &quot;tco-hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps over its dull  
decay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust away  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the grave a  
flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
It floats the length of the rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noon-tide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled down where the stream runs  
quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are  
thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er its rocking side  
And looked below in the broken tide  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grow,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner thinks;  
But I love to think of the hours that sped,  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray  
shed,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass  
grew.

the summer months, their present revival is at least  
seasonable; and it is possible that their restoration to  
current print may elicit some tardy sign from the un­  
known bard who need never have felf ashamed to own  
himself the singer.--PiTTsDUrGH ChrONICTE.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy all the day through,  
A here ties at its moorings the oid canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
elke a sea-bird&#x27;s wing that the storm has lopred,  
And crossed on the ralling, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done;  
White busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with its dull &quot;toohoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the sides of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
lots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles a falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue,  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still-  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
floats the length of the rusted chain;  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the t hore is kissed at each turning anew  
By the dripping how of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand.  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream ran quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,   
And lobked helow on the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below on the sluggish tide.  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I heard had a soberer tone;  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Has grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray shed,  
Ere the blossom waved or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

were written by Albert Pike,-EDs.  
ALVALANCHE,  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore steep  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through;  
There lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a seabird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with the dull &quot;too-whoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe,  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly in its living grave;  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er his dull decay  
Hiding its moulding dust away,  
Like the hands that plants o&#x27;er a tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
But the twilight wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
It floats the length of its rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part the noonday chime.  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew.  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe,  
Oh, many a time with ceaseless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wide and the eddies are thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrowed back from the old canoe.  
But now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is grave grown,  
And the laugh that I hear is a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their whites pray shed  
Ere the blossom or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe

O, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand

The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone  
And the hands that lent to the light skinf

Have grown familiar with stemer things,

The Old Canoe—Emily Rebecca Page  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank,  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lies at the moorings the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
  
Like a sea-bird’s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o’er one,  
  
Like the folded hands when the work is done,  
While busily back and forth between,  
  
The spider stretches his silvery screen ;  
  
And the solemn owl, with his dull “ too-hoo,”  
Settles down on the sides of the old canoe.  
  
The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave,  
  
Rots slowly in its living grave,  
  
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;  
  
While many a blossom of the loveliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.

Where the rugged pine, In its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding

Where the shadow Is heavy the whole day

There lies at its mooring the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has

And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done,  
While busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl with the dull &quot;too-whoe,&quot;

The stern half sunk in the glimy wave,  
Rots slowly away on its living grave,

While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
The twilivht wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part with the mountain chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
By the drippling bough of the old canoe.  
Oh! many a time with ceaseless hand  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream runs  
quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are  
thick,  
And laughed as I learned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the laces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,

Where the rocks axe grwy and the shore is  
steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Ijeans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and  
lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding  
bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day  
through,  
There lies at its mooring the old canoe.  
The useless paIdles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hag  
lopped,  
And crossed on the railing: one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done,  
While busily bark and forth between  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl with the dull &#x27;too­  
whoo,&#x27;Settles dov-11 on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Ttots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its moldering dust away,  
Liike the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a  
flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
But the twilight wind plays with the boat at  
will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh! many a time with careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly  
strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream runs  
quiek,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies  
thiek,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking

And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrowed back from the old  
canoe.  
But, now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
All the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,

A glory of olive and amber wine,  
To the westering sun the colors run  
Through the deeps of the ripening wheat.  
  
O glorious land! My Western land,  
Outspread beneath the setting sun!  
Once more amid your swells I stand,  
And cross your sod lands dry and dun,  
I hear the jocund calls of men  
Who sweep amid the ripened grain  
With swift, stern reapers, once again.  
  
The evening splendor floods the plain,  
The cricket’s chime  
Makes pauseless rhyme,

Like the folded hands when the work is done,  
While busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull “too-hoo,”  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
  
Th« stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,  
Hiding its mol’dring dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the lengths of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
*By the rippling bow of the old canoe.  
  
•Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
T have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs  
quick,  
Where the whirls are wide and the eddies are  
  
thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocky side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That where mirrored back from the old canoe,  
  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lend to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray  
  
shed,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew  
•O’er the moldering stern of the old canoe

By Albert Pike.  
Where the rooks are gray and tho shore is  
steep.  
And the waters below look dark and deep.  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonoly pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide,  
Where the reed sand rushes are long and  
rank.  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding  
bank,  
Whore the shadow is heavy the whole day  
through,  
There lies ut its moorings the old canoe.  
i  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like seabird’s wings that storms had  
lopped,  
And cross,d on the railing one o’er one  
Like the folded hands when the work is  
done,  
While busily back and forth between  
Ttie spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And tho solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too­  
hoo’’  
Settles down on the s^de of the old canoe.  
The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er Its dull de­  
cay,  
Hiding its moulding dust away.  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a  
flower  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still  
But the light wind plays with the boat at  
’ will.  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet end part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turning  
anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe. ^  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
1 have pushed it away from the pebbly  
strand,  
And paddled R down where the stream  
runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies

To sec that the faces and boats were two.  
That were mirrored back from the old ca­

But now. as 1 lean o’er the crumbling side,

And the laugh that I hear has a soberer

And the hands that lent to the light skiff  
wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.
