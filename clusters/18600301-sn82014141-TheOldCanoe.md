*THE OLD CANOE.**  
  
**BY EMILY R. PAGE.**  
  
Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,    
And the waters below look dark and deep;    
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,    
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;    
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,    
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;    
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day thro&#x27;,    
Lies at its mooring, the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,    
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lopped,    
And crossed on the railing one o&#x27;er one,    
Like folded hands when the work is done;    
While busily back and forth between,    
The spider stretches his silvery screen,    
And the solemn owl with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;    
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,    
Rots slowly away, in its living grave;    
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,    
Hiding the mouldering dust away,    
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,    
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;    
While many a blossom of loveliest hue    
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
The current waters are dead and still,    
But the light winds play with the boat at will;    
And lazily in and out again,    
It floats the length of the rusty chain,    
Like the weary march of the hands of time,    
That meet and part at the noontide chime;    
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew    
By the dipping bow of the old canoe.  
  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,    
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,    
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,    
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,    
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,    
And looked below in the broken tide,    
To see that the faces and boats were two,    
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
  
But now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,    
And look below in the sluggish tide,    
The face that I see there is graver grown,    
And the laugh that I hear has a sobered tone,    
And the hand that lent to the light skiff wings    
Have grown familiar with sterner things;    
But I love to think of the hours that flew,    
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,    
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green moss grew,    
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

[The following sweet picture is from life, and though we  
published it nearly a year since, we again present it to  
our readers. taken from a London journal. We do not  
wonder, as we read the musical versification, and enjoy  
the delicate and yet vivid truthfulness of the poem,  
that it shonld have heen so extensively copied in Euro-  
pean journals, after going the extended round of the  
American press. It is from the pen of our favorite  
contributor, Miss Emmy R. Pas.)

LALE.  
  
From the Flag of our Union.  
The Cld Canoe.  
BY EMILY R. PAGE.  
Where the rocks are gray; and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep ;  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
‘Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank—  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lays at its morings the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird’s wings that the storm hath lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o’er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is done ;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull * too hoo*”?  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower ;  
‘While many a blossom of loveliest hue y  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light winds play with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the moontide chime ; .  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
  
0, many a time, with a careless hand,  
. I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick—  
‘Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick—  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrowed back from the old canoe !  
  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with ‘sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green moss grew  
Q’er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

POETRY.  
THE OLD CANOE.  
‘Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
‘Where the rugged pine in its lonel&amp;r pride,  
Leans gloomin over the murky tide;  
‘Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
‘Where the shadow is l\envir the whole day through,  
Lays at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea blrd’l wings that the storm hath lopped,  
And crossed on the rullln%, one o’er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is doue;  
‘While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silver screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull *“too hoo,”  
Settles down on the side of the old eanoe,  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its livln‘; grave,  
And the green mMOoss creega o’er its dull decay,  
}lidinf the mouldering dust away.  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;  
While many a blossom of liveilest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light winds play with the boatat will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
1t floats tze length of its rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet un«( Eart at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
O many a time with a careless hand  
1 have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick—  
Where the whirls are wild &amp; d the eddies are thick—  
And lnuﬁhcd as I leaned o’er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now as I lean o’er the crumbling side  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I se2 there is Erlver TOWn,  
And the laugh that I hear has a so%erer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have Frown familiar with sterner thln‘i;s,  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew  
O’er the mouldering stern ot the old canoe.

And paddled it down where the stream runs quick—  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick—  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,  
And louked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the face* and boats were two,

The following lines, which we clip lrom the Arkansas  
State Gazette, are full of genuine poetry :  
Xlie Old Canoe.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep.  
And the waters below look dark aud deep ;  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ; 1  
( Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
&#x27; . And the weed grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lays at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddle are idly dropped,  
&#x27; Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one ;  
Like folded hands when the work is done ;  
While busily back ajd forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And tne solemn owl, with bis dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding the monldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower.  
Or the ivy that mantles a fallen tower ;  
While many a blossom of liveliest hue,  
  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old cane.  
The currentless waters are dead and still  
But the light winds play with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and eut again,  
It floats tne length of its rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hand of time,  
That meet and partat the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,  
By the drippiog bow of the old c noe.  
O, many a time with a careless band  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs.quick  
Where the whirls are wild and the storm runs thick  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And look below in the broken tide,  
To see that the laces and boats were two,  
T hut were mirrored back from the o&#x27;.d canoe.  
But now, hs I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
A d l ok be&#x27;ow in the sluggish tide,  
Th3 f :c- t hat I see there is graver grown,  
And the Inurh that I hear has a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner thingu ;  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms moved or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

THE OLD CANOE.  
  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through  
Lays at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hath lopped.  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen;  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;  
While many a blossom of liveliest hue,  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
But the light winds play with the boat at w  
And laziy in and out again,  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
O, many a time with a careless hand  
I have pulled it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs  
quick  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are  
thick  
And I laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And looked below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the skiff light wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things,  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray  
threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

THE OLD CANOE.  
We take great pleasure in reproducing this ex­  
quisite poem, cut many years ago from an obscure  
Arkansas paper, and published in the North.—  
Every now and then it re-appears on the surface of  
newspaper literature. It desires a more prominent  
place in our letters :  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
&#x27; And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank ;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The uselesss paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done ;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tonib a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;  
While many a blossom of the loveliest hue,  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waves are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the wenry march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime.  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew.  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
O, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand ;  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
And now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skill&#x27; wings,  
Have grown familial- with sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that flew  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew,  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stem of the old canoe.

THE OLD CANOE.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is  
steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank  
And the weeds grow thick on thewindingbank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day  
through  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has  
looped.  
And crossed on the railing one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily hack and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with its dull &#x27;&quot;too-too,  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull de.  
cay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a  
flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue.  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stem of the old canoe.  
The currentles3 waves are dead and still-  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meets and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
j3y the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
  
0, many a time, with a careless hand.  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand;  
And paddled it down where the stream runs

Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are

And laughed as 1 leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,

And now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,

The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,

Have grown familiar with sterner things.

. .  
The Old Canoe.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep :  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank,  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day thro&#x27;  
Lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Nestles down on the side of the old can«e.  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding the moldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles a fallen tower;  
While many a blossom of liveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern ofthe old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light winds play with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream ran quick,  
Where the whirls were wild and the storm was  
thick;  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the brokeji tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide  
The face that I see is graver grown,  
And the laugh I heard has a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things ;  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their wild spray  
threw;  
Ere the blossoms moved or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the moldering stern ofthe old canoe.

Whero the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,

beans gloomily over the murky tide;

The Old Canoe.  
The following beautiful poem appeared some  
years ago in an obscure Arkansas paper:  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride  
eans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day

les at its moorings the old canoe,  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
ike a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lop-  
ped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
tke the folded hands when the work is done:  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-whoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
tot slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
tiing its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
or the ivy that manties the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe,  
The currentless waters are dead and still  
And the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
and the shore is Kissed af each turning anew,  
by the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
O, many a time, with a careless hand.  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand;  
And paddled it down where the stream runs  
quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are  
thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
nd the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things,  
But I love to think of the hours that flew

And the waters below look dark and deep,

Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of lovliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
1t floats the length of the rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old caroe.  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
Ihave pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick  
And lauihed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laughjthat I hear has a soberer tone;  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As 1 x}&#x27;lo(&#x27;;]ked where the whirls their white spray  
shed,  
Ere the blossom waved or the green grass grew,  
O’er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

Long before the war,the appended simple but  
charming verses appeared in a short-lived pa  
per at Little llouk, Ark., without signature or  
address . As they have a toue and sentiment in  
keeping with the last jof the summer months,  
their present revival is at least seasonable; and  
it is possible that their restoration to current  
priut may elicit some tardy sign from the un  
known bard who need never have felt ashamed  
to own himself the signer.  
THE OLD CANOK.  
&quot;XT7&quot;HERE the rocks are gray and the shore is  
IT &#x27; steep, - -  
Aud the waters lielew look dark and deep.  
Where the mggeitpine, in its lofty pride.  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are loug aud rauk.  
And the weeds grow thick oh the winding bank  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day  
tnrougn,  
There lies at its moorings the old cauoe.  
The useless paddles are idlr drovued.  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lop­  
ped, - - .. - . !  
A nd crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded bands wheu the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between  
Thespider stretches bis silvery sheen.  
And the solemn owl. with his dull &#x27;&#x27;too-hoo,&quot;  
bettles down on the side of tbe old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimv wave,  
Rots slowly away in its liviug grave.  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its moldering dust away,  
Like the band that plauts o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue,  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern ot the old cauoflp  
The currentless waters are dead and still­  
But the light wind plays with the boat at Mill,  
And lazilv in and out again  
It floats the length of the rustv chain.  
Like the woary march of Uie hands of time.  
That meet aud part at the noontidecnime;  
And theshore is kis.,ed at each turning anew,  
By the dripping how of the old canue.  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream runs

And

ROMANCE U POLITICS.  
The Columbus State Journal tells  
the story of love of some Ohio poli­  
ticians, among others, of Hon. William  
Allen, the Democratic nominee for the  
Governorship of the State. In 1830  
Mr. Allen was nominated for Congress  
by the Democrats, and Mr. McArthur,  
the Whig Governor, was a candidate f er  
re-ekcticn. Mr. Allen loved the Gov­  
ernor&#x27;s daughter, but the father broke  
off the match, and the lady married a  
Kentuckian, who died before the end of  
Mr. Allen&#x27;s term in the House. Gov­  
ernor McArthur nlso died. Now comes  
what seems almost the action of a deus  
ex machina. There was anultra-Democrat  
whose daughter loved and wedded  
a Whig, when the father had had his  
eye upon Allen G. Thurman as an eligi­  
ble husband for her. Soon he, too, slept  
with his fathers, the lady became a  
widow and married Mr. Thurman. At  
the wedding Mr. Allen again met Miss  
McArthur (now a widow). The old love  
returned, and they, too, begame hus­  
band and wife. Here is plenty ofre-man-e  
for a dime novel.  
&quot;But stop, mychild.and listen to me.

THE OLD CANOE.  
 eeeeeee eae  
The following fine verses appeared  
anonymously some years ago in a pa-  
per at Little Rock, Arkansas. The  
writter could have well afforded to  
give his or her name with it.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide:  
Where the reeds and the rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
There lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea-bird&#x27;s wings that the storm has lopped  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done:  
While busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches his silver screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too-hoo,&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of lovilest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoc.  
The currentless waters are dead and still  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below at the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wing  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray shed,  
Ere the blossom waved, or the green grass grew,  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

ROMANCE IN POLITICS.  
The Columbus State Journal tells |  
the story of love of some Ohio poli- &lt;  
tician3, among others, of Hon. William 1  
All&lt;:n, the Democratic nominee for the 1  
Governorship of the State. In 1830 j  
Mr. Allen was nominated for Congress j  
by the Democrats, and Mr. McArthur, &lt;  
the Whig Governor, was a candidate for  
rc-electicn. Mr. Allen loved the Gov- 1  
  
ernor s daughter, but the father broke  
off the match, and the lady married a  
Iventuckian, who died before the end of  
Mr. Allen&#x27;s term in the House. Governor  
McArthur also died. Now comes  
what seems almost the action of a dcus  
cx machina. Thero was an ultra-Democrat  
whose daughter loved and wedded  
a Whig, when the father had had his  
eye upon Allen G. Thurman as an eligible  
husband for her. Soon he, too, slept  
with his fathers, the lqdy became a  
widow and married Mr. Thurman. At  
tho wedding Mr. Allen again met Miss  
McArthur (now a widow). The old love  
returned, and they, too, became husband  
and wife. Here is plenty of romance  
for a dime novel.  
&quot;But stop, mychild.and listen to me.

The face that I see there is graver grown,

THOE OLD CANOE.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rufged pine, 1 its lonely pride, .  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
There lies at its moorings an old canoe.  
The useless paddlcs are idly dropped,  
Like a sca-bird’s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o’er one,  
Like the folded hands when the w ork is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl, with his dull “toe-hoe,”  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern, half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss cre%s o’er its dull decay,  
llidiui its mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Spring up o’er the stern of the ¢ld canoe.  
The currentiess waters are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazilg in and out again  
It floats the length of the rustljlr chain,  
Like the weax(&#x27;iy march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
1 have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are \y&amp;ld and&#x27;the eddies are thick,  
And laughed as I&#x27;leanéd o’er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the brokén tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver %rown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to think of the hours that sped

THE-OLD CANOE.  
■Where the rocka are gray and the shore is steep.  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride  
.Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the roods and rushes are long and rank.  
And the weds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through.  
There lies at its moorings the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped.  
Xdke a sea-bird’s wings that the storm has lopped.  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one.  
Like the folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches his silvery son •.i.  
And the solemn owl with hisj dull *• to &gt; ,  
Settles down on the aide of the old canoe. ,  
The stern, half-sunk, in the slimy wave,  
Rota slowly away in its living grave.  
And the green moss creeps over its dull decay.  
Hiding its moldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb of a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentloss waters are dead and still;  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out ag in  
It floats the length of tne rusty chain,  
Like the weary march ox the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew.  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Ob. many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly Strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick.  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick.  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er the rocking side.  
And looked below in the broken tide.  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old oanoe.  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide.  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that! hear has a soberer tone,  
And the hand that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to thimc of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray shed,  
JCre the blossom waved, or the green grass grew

The Old Canoe  
Long before the war the iippeiulcd simple

Bock : -Alh4lki 1  
Where the rock are gray and the shore i steep.  
And the waters below look dark and deep.  
Where the rugged pine, in Us lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide; .  
Where tliarced and rushes are long and lank.  
And thlf jwtjfcfr grow thick on the winding  
haukV  
Where tbe shadow Is heavy the whole day  
through,  
There lies at Us mooring the old canoe.  
Tbe useless paddles are Idly dropped,  
Like a seu bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hask-p-ped,  
And crossed an the railing, one o&#x27;er MM.  
I.Ike the folded hands when tbe work Is done,  
While busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches bis silvery screen,  
And the .solemn owl with the dull &quot;too-whoo,&quot;  
Hetties down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk In the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away In Its living grave.  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er his dull decay  
Hiding Its moulderliiu dust away.  
  
Like the hand that plauts o&#x27;er the tomb a  
flower,  
Or the Ivy that mantles the railing tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest line  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
Tbe currentless waters are dull and still,  
But the twilight wind plays with the tsuit at  
will.  
And lazily In and out asuln  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time.  
That meet and part at the noontide rhino .  
And tbe shore Is kissed at each turning anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
Oh, many a time with reaseleas hand,  
I have pushed It away from tbe pebbly strand,  
And paddled It down where the stream runs  
quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are  
thick.  
  
And laughed as I leaned o&#x27;er rocking side,  
And looked below In the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boots were two,  
That were mirrored back from tha old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the arumbllng side,  
And look below at the sluggish tide.  
The face that I see there Is graver grown.  
And tbe laugh that I hear Is a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  
But I lave to think of tha hours that sped  
As I rocked where tha Whirl, their white apray  
shed a  
Ere the blossoms waved or the green grass grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

The Old Canoe—Emily Rebecca Page  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep,  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide ;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank,  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,  
Lies at the moorings the old canoe.  
  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
  
Like a sea-bird’s wings that the storm has lopped,  
And crossed on the railing, one o’er one,  
  
Like the folded hands when the work is done,  
While busily back and forth between,  
  
The spider stretches his silvery screen ;  
  
And the solemn owl, with his dull “ too-hoo,”  
Settles down on the sides of the old canoe.  
  
The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave,  
  
Rots slowly in its living grave,  
  
And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
  
Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower ;  
  
While many a blossom of the loveliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
  
The currentless waters are dead and still—  
But the light wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again,  
  
It floats the length of its rusty chain,  
  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noon-tide chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew  
  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe.  
  
Many a time, with careless hand  
  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick—  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick—  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,  
  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
  
But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,  
  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,  
  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things ;  
  
But I love to think of the hours that flew  
  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew  
O’er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

covinGToN. LOUISIANA,  
THE OLD CANOE.  
Where the rocks are gray and the shore is  
steep  
Aad the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are long and lank.  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding  
bank:  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day  
through.  
There lies at its mooring the old canoe.  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea bird&#x27;s wings that the storm hat  
pped  
And crossed on the railing, one o&#x27;er one,  
Like the folded hands when the work is done,  
While busily back and forth between  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl with the dull &quot;too-whoc.&quot;  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.  
The stern half sunk in the glimy wave,  
Rots slowly away on its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er its dull decay,  
Hiding its mouldering days away.  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a  
fower.  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower:  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o&#x27;er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still,  
The twilight wind plays with the boat at will,  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part with the mountain chime,  
And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,  
By the drippling bough of the old canoe.  
Oh! many a time with ceaseless hand  
have pushed it away from the pebbly strand.  
And paddled it down where the stream runs  
quick,  
 Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are  
thick,  
And laughed as I learned o&#x27;er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.  
But now, as I lean o&#x27;er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear is a sober tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff  
wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things,  
But I love to think of the hours that sped  
As I rocked where the whirls their white  
spray shed  
Ere the blossom waved or the green grass  
grew  
O&#x27;er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.

ThE OLD CANOE.

Rots slowly away in its living grave;

.  
Where the rooks are gray and tho shore is  
steep.  
And the waters below look dark and deep.  
Where the rugged pine, in its lonoly pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide,  
Where the reed sand rushes are long and  
rank.  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding  
bank,  
Whore the shadow is heavy the whole day  
through,  
There lies ut its moorings the old canoe.  
i  
The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like seabird’s wings that storms had  
lopped,  
And cross,d on the railing one o’er one  
Like the folded hands when the work is  
done,  
While busily back and forth between  
Ttie spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And tho solemn owl, with his dull &quot;too­  
hoo’’  
Settles down on the s^de of the old canoe.  
The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave  
Rots slowly away in its living grave,  
And the green moss creeps o&#x27;er Its dull de­  
cay,  
Hiding its moulding dust away.  
Like the hand that plants o&#x27;er the tomb a  
flower  
Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.  
The currentless waters are dead and still  
But the light wind plays with the boat at  
’ will.  
And lazily in and out again  
It floats the length of the rusty chain.  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet end part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turning  
anew,  
By the dripping bow of the old canoe. ^  
Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
1 have pushed it away from the pebbly  
strand,  
And paddled R down where the stream  
runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies  
are thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking  
side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To sec that the faces and boats were two.  
That were mirrored back from the old ca­  
noe.  
But now. as 1 lean o’er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown.  
And the laugh that I hear has a soberer  
tone,  
And the hands that lent to the light skiff  
wings,  
Have grown familiar with sterner things.  
But I love to&#x27; think of the hours that sped  
As I rooked where the whirls their white  
spray shed.  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass  
grew  
O&#x27;er tho coldlng stern of the old canoe.
