It was indeed with very great Pleasure that I received and read the Letter your Exy. did me the honour of writing to me, communicating that of the President of Congress and the Resolutions of that Body relative to the Succours then expected: For the Sentiments therein express’d are so different from the Language held by Mr Adams, in his late Letters to your Excellency as to make it clear that it was from his particular Indiscretion alone, and not from any Instructions received by him, that he has given such just Cause of Displeasure, and that it is impossible his Conduct therein should be approved by his Constituents. I am glad he has not admitted me to any Participation in those Writings, and that he has taken the Resolution he expresses of not communicating with me or making use of my Intervention in his future Correspondence; a Resolution that I believe he will keep, as he has never yet communicated to me more of his Business in Europe than I have seen in the News Papers. I live upon Terms of Civility with him, not of Intimacy. I shall as you desire lay before Congress the whole Correspondence which you have sent me for that purpose.  
With the greatest &amp; most sincere Respect, I am, Sir, Your Ex

Str,—It was, indeed, with very great  
pleasure that I received the letter your  
Excellency did me the honour of writing  
to me, communicating that of the Presi-  
dent of Congress, and the resolutions of  
that body relative to the succours then  
expected : for the sentiments therein  
expressed are so different from the lan-  
guage held by Mr. Adams in his late  
letters to your Excellency, as to make it  
clear that it was from his particular in-  
discretion alone, and not from any in-  
structions received by him, that he has  
given such just cause of displeasure, and  
that it is impossible his conduct therein  
should be approved by his constituents.

Iam glad he has not admitted me to  
any participation of those writings, and  
that he has taken the resolution he ex-  
presses of not communicating with me,  
or making use of my intervention in his  
future correspondence ; a resolution that  
I believe he will keep, as he has never

business in Europe than 1 have seen in
