Emigration from England to the United  
States is increasing rapidly. During the last  
three months for which an official report was  
made, the departures from Liverpool were  
5000 in excess of the preceding quarter.  
Among these emigrants are many skilled laborers-and  
mechanics.  
Western distillers have added a new  
feature to their whisky, as if it were not sufficiently  
caustic and deadly before. Sulphuric  
acid is now added in such quantity that it soon  
eats up the inside of the barrels, and instantly  
blackens iron or copper. Pleasant stuff to  
put into a man&#x27;s stomach !  
An English chemist has been experimenting  
for the purpose of ascertaining how  
  
much of various kinds of food must be eaten  
in order to make one pound of flesh. He  
comes to the conclusion that it requires 25  
pounds of milk, 100 of turnips, 50 of potatoes,  
50 of carrots, 9 of oat meal, 7 of barley  
meal, and 3 of peas or beans
