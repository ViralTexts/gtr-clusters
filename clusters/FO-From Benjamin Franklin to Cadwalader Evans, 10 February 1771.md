London, Feb. 10, 1771.  
I have not now before me your Letter which came with the Sample of Silk, having put it into the Hands of Mr. Walpole with the Sample, who has promised me full and particular Answers to all your Queries, after the Silk has been thoroughly examined. In the mean time he tells me, the best Sort appears to him to be worth in itself 27 or 28s. a pound; and will fetch that Price when some Imperfections in the Reeling it are remedied. He tells me farther, that the best Eggs are to be had from Valentia in Spain, whence he will procure some for you against the next Year; the Worms from those Eggs being the strongest, healthiest, and producing the finest Silk of any others: And he thinks you should get some Reelers from Italy, which he would likewise undertake to do for you if desired. He is one of the most opulent and noble spirited Merchants of this Kingdom. I shall write to you fully per Osborne, with all the Information I can procure. In the mean time, Please to present my respects to the Gentlemen concern’d in the Affair, and assure them of my best Services. I am, my dear Friend, Yours affectionately,  
B. Franklin.  
Dr. Cadwr. Evans.

Dear Doctor,  
  
I have not now before me your Letter which came  
with the Sample of Silk, having put it into the Hands  
of Mr. Walpole with the Sample, who has promised me  
full and particular Answers to all your Queries, after  
the Silk has been thoroughly examined. In the mean  
time he teils me, the best Sort appears to him to be  
worth in itself 27 or 28f a pound; and will fetch that  
Price when some Imperfections in the Reeling it are re-  
medied. He tells me farther, that the best Eggs are to  
be had from Valentia in Spain, whence he will procure  
some for you against the next Year; the Worms from  
those Eggs being the strongest, healthiest, and produc-  
ing the finest Silk of any others:—And he thinks you  
should get some Reelers from Italy, which he would  
likewise undertake to do for you if desired.&#x27; He is one  
of the most opulent and noble spirited Merchants of this  
Kingdom.—I shall write to you fully per Osborne, with  
all the Information I can procure. In the mean time,  
Please to present my respects to the Gentlemen con-  
cern’d in the Affair, and assure them of my best Ser-  
vices.  
  
I am, my dear Friend,  
Yours affectionately,  
  
B. FRANKLIN.  
Dr. Cadwr. Evans.
