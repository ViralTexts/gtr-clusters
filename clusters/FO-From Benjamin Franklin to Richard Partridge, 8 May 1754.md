render his small fortress in the Forks of Monongehela, at the  
summons of captain Contrecceur, commander of the French for-

battoes, conveying upwards of one thousand men, eighteen pie-  
ces of artillery, and large stores of provisions and other neces-

not (exceeding 30,) and no cannon to make a proper defence was  
forced to deliver up the fort on the 17th instant. They suffered  
him to draw out his men, arms, and working tools, and gave leave  
that he might retreat to the inhabitants with them. I have heard  
of your excellency’s great zeal for his majesty’s service, and for  
all our interests on the present occasion; therefore I am persuad-

War, ten years before, when Shirley called upon  
all the colonies for collective aid. Anda month  
before the assembling of the Congress, after nar-
