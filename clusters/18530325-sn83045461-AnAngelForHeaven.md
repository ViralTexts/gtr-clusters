WANTED--AN ANGEL FOR HEAVEN.--And so death closed those little eyes--shrouded their bright glances. O, that the sun would not come streaming in on his shrouded form, as if there were no grief in the world!  
  
How sweetly he sleeps, that little coveted angel! How lightly curl the glossy rings on his white forehead! You could weep your very soul away, to think those cherub lips will never, never unclose. Vainly you clasp and unclasp that passive darling hand that wandered so often over your cheek. Vainly your anguished glance strives to read the dim story of love in those faded orbs. The voice, sweet as winds blowing through wreathed shells, slumbers forever. And still the busy world knocks at your door, and will let you have no peace. It shouts in your ears ; its chariots rumble by; it smiles broadly in your care-worn face ; it mocks you as you sew the shroud ; it meets you at the coffin, at the grave; and its heavy footsteps tramp up and down in the empty rooms from whence you have borne your dead. But it comes never in the hush of night to wipe away your tears !  
  
Wanted--an angel for heaven! Can you look up? Can you bear the splendor of that sight ? Ten thousand celestial beings, and your own radient child in their midst.  
  
&quot;In his eyes a glory light. On his brow a glory crown.&quot;    
  
Wanted--angels for heaven! Cling not too closely to your beautiful treasures, children of earth!  
  
&quot;You have two children,&quot; said I.   
  
&quot;I have four,&quot; was the reply; &quot;two on earth, two in heaven.&quot;  
  
There spoke the mother! Still her&#x27;s! &#x27; only &quot;gone before!&quot; Still remembered, loved, and cherished by the hearth and at the board ; their places not yet filled, even though their successors draw life from the same faithful breast where their dying heads were pillowed.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Safely housed from storm and tempest: no sickness there, nor droping head, nor fading eye, nur weary feet! By the green pastures, tended by the Good Shepherd, linger the little lambs of the heavenly fold.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Earth less attractive! Eternity nearer! invisible cords drawing the maternal soul upwards. &quot;Still small&quot; voices ever whispering come! to the world, weary spirit.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Mother of angels walk softly! Holy eyes watch thy footsteps, cherub forms bend to I listen! Keep thy spirit free from earth&#x27;s taint; so shalt thou &quot;go to them,&quot; though &quot;they may not return to thee.&quot;

ation wliicli can make the dying die in peace.  
While on the bed of pain she lay,  
Her every whisper seemed to say :  
God take thy Lizzy to thy care,  
To be with Thee and Pa, is now my only prayer.  
When death&#x27;s cold hand had siezed ite prey,  
Her placid countenance seemed to say :  
I see my Pa in yonder realm, ,

26th of October, 1853, GEORGE J. If. HUNTER, son of Wm  
and Octavia E. Hunter, aged 8 months and 22 days.  
And so death closed those little eyes—shrouded their  
bright glances. How sweetly he sleeps, that little coveted  
angel! How lightly curl the glossy ringlets on his white  
forehead ! You could weep your very soul away to think  
those cherub lips will never, never unclose. Vainly you  
clasp and unclasp that passive, darling hand, that wandered  
so often over your cheek. Vainly your anguished glance  
strives to read the dim story of love in those faded orbs.  
The voice, sweet as winds blowing through wreathed shells,  
slumbers for ever. And still the busfcworld knocks at your  
door, and will let you havj no peace. It shouts in your ear.  
.to chariots rumble by ; it smiles broadly in your care-worn  
face ; it mocks you as you sew the shrowd ; it meet« you at  
the coffin, at the grave ; and its heavy footsteps tramp up  
and down, in the empty rooms from whence you have borne  
your dead. But it comes never in tlie hush of night to wipe  
away your tears !  
Wanted—angel for heaven! Can you look up ? Can you  
bear the splendor of that sight? Ten thousand celestial  
beings and your own radiant child-angel in their midst.  
&quot; In his eyes a glory light,  
On his brow a glory crown.&quot;  
Wanted—angel tor heaven ! Cling not too closely to your  
beautiful treasures, children of earth !

world.  
  
How sweetly he sleeps, that precious little

his white forehead ! You could weep your  
very soul away to think those cherub lips will  
never unclose—never again be heard to utter  
in soft sweet tones the name of father, mother  
brother or sister ! Vainly you clasp and un­  
clasp that passive darling hand, that wander­

of love in those faded orbs. The voice, sweet  
as zephyrs, breathing through wreathed shells  
slumber forever.  
  
And still the busy world knocks at your  
door, and will let you have no peace. It  
shouts in your ear ; its chariots rumble by ;  
it smiles broadly in your care-worn face ; it  
mocks you as you gaze on the attenuated and  
loved body ; it meets you at the coffin—at the  
grave ; and its heavy footsteps tramp up and  
down in the empty rooms from whence you  
have borne your dead. But it comes never  
in the hush of night to wipe away your tears.&#x27;  
Your loved, your idolized boy is in heaven .&#x27;

their midst!

“You have two children,” said I.  
“I have four,” was the reply ; &quot;two on  
earth, two in heaven.”  
  
Thus spoke the mother! Still hers,  
only gone before &#x27;. Still remembered, lived  
and cherished, by the hearth and at the  
board ; their places not yet filled ; even  
though their successors draw life from the  
same faithful breast where their dying  
heads were pillowed.  
“Two in heaven !”  
  
Safely housed from storm and tempest.  
No sickness there, no drooping head, nor  
fading eye, nor weary feet. By the green  
pastures, tended by the good Shepherd,  
linger the little lambs of the heavenly  
fold.  
“Two in heaven 1”  
  
Earth less attractive. Eternity near­

Mother of angels ! Walk softly !—holy

bend to listen ! Keep thy spirit free from  
earth taint ; so shalt thou go to them,  
though they may not return to thee.

THE CHILD-ANGEL.  
  
Deatu has closed those little eyes and forever  
shrouded their bright glances. How sweet!y she  
sleeps, that little coveted angel! How lightly  
curl the glossy ringlets on her forehead! You  
could weep your very soul away to think

Vainly your anguished glanees strive to read the

And so death closed those little eyes  
shrouded their bright glances. Oh,  
that the sun would not come streaming  
in on his shrouded form, as if there was  
no grief in the world.  
How sweetly he sleeps, that little  
coveted angel! How lightly curl the  
glossy ringlets on his white forehead,  
You could weep your very soul away  
to think those cherub lips will never,  
never unclose. Vainly you clasp and  
unclasp that passive, darling hand, that  
wandered so often over your cheek.  
Vainly your anguished ghince strives  
to read the dim story of love in those  
faded orbs. The voice, sweet as winds  
blowing through wreathed shells, slum­  
bers for ever. And still the busy world  
knocks at your door, and will let you  
have no peace. It shouts in your ear;  
its chariots rumble by; it smiles broadly  
in your care-worn face; it mocks you as  
you sew the shroud; it meets you at the  
coffin, at the grave; and its heavy foot­  
steps tramp up and down in the empty  
rooms from whence you have borne  
your dead. But it comes never in the  
hush of night to wipe away your tears!

More oF Curist.—Those who call themselves  
Christians need more of Christ. How few, com-  
paratively, who believe upon him, grow up to a sym-  
metrical manhood in his service! How few feel that  
they are called saints—their vision filled with his  
exceeding beauty—self and sin crucified—like a hymn  
melodious with joy even amid dark and rugged ways !  
More of Christ is needed by preacher and people, by  
the lofty and the lowly, the wise and the unwise.  
The multitudes who grope in spiritual ignorance,  
who stagger under their burdens, who shudder with  
their fears and woes, who are gliding toward terrible  
vortices in the giddy whirl of business and pleasure,  
need more of Christ. More of Christ would make  
that sad home bright, that wavering soul steadfast,  
that mourning heart glad, that burdened conscience  
light, would impel to merciful labors that selfish  
nature, and make those who stand apart in enmity  
clasp forgiving hands. More of Christ would smite  
down sectarian walls, strip the covering from the  
ecclesiastical shams, hush the whine of cant, blow  
soft winds of refreshment to weary wanderers, win  
outcasts to the fold, wipe stigmas of exclusiveness  
and mammon from the Church, lead the joyous flock  
by still waters, and make the desert blossom as the  
rose. More of Christ is what we all want in our  
hearts, our homes, our Churches, our business, our  
politics, our schools, our literature, our art, our gov-  
ernment—more of his sweet, holy, courageous, sacri-  
ficing spirit—more of his patience, his love, his ten-  
der appreciation of man. Yea, we want him as our  
own precious Redeemer, whose blood cleanseth from  
all sin.—Rev. H. N. Powers, D. D.  
  
WANTED, AN ANGEL FOR HEAVEN.—And so death  
closed those little eyes—shrouded their light glances.  
O, that the sun would not come streaming on her  
shrouded form, as if there were no grief in the world!  
  
How sweetly she sleeps, that little angel! How  
lightly curl the glossy rings on her white forehead!  
You could weep your very soul away, to think those  
cherub lips will never, never unclose. Vainly you  
clasp and unclasp that passive, darling hand that  
wandered so often over your cheek. Vainly your  
anguished glance strives to read the dim story of  
love in those faded orbs. The voice, sweet as winds  
blowing through wreathed shells, slumbers forever.  
And still the busy world knocks at your door, and  
will let you have no peace. It shouts in your ear ;  
its chariots rumble by; it smiles broadly in your  
care-worn face ; it mocks you as you sew the shroud ;  
it meets you at the coffin, at the grave ; and its heavy  
footsteps tramp up and down in the empty rooms  
whence you have borne the dead. But it comes  
never in the hush of night to wipe away your tears.

Can you bear the splendor of that sight? Ten thou-

angel in their midst ;

On her brow a glory crown.”
