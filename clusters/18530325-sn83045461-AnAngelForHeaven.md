WANTED--AN ANGEL FOR HEAVEN.--And so death closed those little eyes--shrouded their bright glances. O, that the sun would not come streaming in on his shrouded form, as if there were no grief in the world!  
  
How sweetly he sleeps, that little coveted angel! How lightly curl the glossy rings on his white forehead! You could weep your very soul away, to think those cherub lips will never, never unclose. Vainly you clasp and unclasp that passive darling hand that wandered so often over your cheek. Vainly your anguished glance strives to read the dim story of love in those faded orbs. The voice, sweet as winds blowing through wreathed shells, slumbers forever. And still the busy world knocks at your door, and will let you have no peace. It shouts in your ears ; its chariots rumble by; it smiles broadly in your care-worn face ; it mocks you as you sew the shroud ; it meets you at the coffin, at the grave; and its heavy footsteps tramp up and down in the empty rooms from whence you have borne your dead. But it comes never in the hush of night to wipe away your tears !  
  
Wanted--an angel for heaven! Can you look up? Can you bear the splendor of that sight ? Ten thousand celestial beings, and your own radient child in their midst.  
  
&quot;In his eyes a glory light. On his brow a glory crown.&quot;    
  
Wanted--angels for heaven! Cling not too closely to your beautiful treasures, children of earth!  
  
&quot;You have two children,&quot; said I.   
  
&quot;I have four,&quot; was the reply; &quot;two on earth, two in heaven.&quot;  
  
There spoke the mother! Still her&#x27;s! &#x27; only &quot;gone before!&quot; Still remembered, loved, and cherished by the hearth and at the board ; their places not yet filled, even though their successors draw life from the same faithful breast where their dying heads were pillowed.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Safely housed from storm and tempest: no sickness there, nor droping head, nor fading eye, nur weary feet! By the green pastures, tended by the Good Shepherd, linger the little lambs of the heavenly fold.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Earth less attractive! Eternity nearer! invisible cords drawing the maternal soul upwards. &quot;Still small&quot; voices ever whispering come! to the world, weary spirit.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Mother of angels walk softly! Holy eyes watch thy footsteps, cherub forms bend to I listen! Keep thy spirit free from earth&#x27;s taint; so shalt thou &quot;go to them,&quot; though &quot;they may not return to thee.&quot;

Wanted--An Angel for Heaven.  
And so death closed those little eyes  
shrouded their bright glances. Oh that  
the sun would not come streaming in on  
his shrouded form as if there were no grief  
in the world!  
ringlets on his white forehead. You could  
weep your very soul away, to think those  
cherub lips will never, never unclose.  
Vainly you clasp and unclasp the passive,  
farling hand that wandered so often over  
your check. Vainly your anguished glance  
strives to read the dim story of love  
in those faded orbs. The voice, sweet as  
winds blowing through wreathed shells,  
lumbers forever. And still the busy  
world knocks at your door, will let you  
have no peace. It shouts in your ear; its  
chariots rumble by; it smiles broadly in.  
your care-worn face; it mocks you as you  
sew the shroud; it meets you at the coffir  
tthe grave; and its heavy footsteps trar up  
up and down in the empty rooms from  
whence you have borne your dead. But  
it comes never in the hush of night to wipe  
away your tears!  
Wanted--an angel for heaven? Can  
you look up? Can you bear the sp&#x27; and  
of the sight? Ten thousand cele  
ings, and your own radiant chiangel in  
On his brow a lor crowa.

And so death closed those little eyes  
hrouded their bright glances. Oh, that  
the sun would not come streaming in on  
his shrouded form, as if there was no grief  
in the world.  
How swectly he sleeps, that little covet­  
ed angel! How lightly curl the glossy  
nugiets on his white forehead! You could  
weep your very soul away to think those  
cherub lips will never, never unclose.  
Vainly you clasp and unclasp that passive,  
larling hand, that wandered so often over  
your cheek, Vainly your anguished glance  
strives to read the dim story of love in those  
faded orbs. The voice, sweet as wind  
blowing through wreathed shells, slumben  
for ever. And still the busy world knocks  
at your door, and will let you have no  
wace. It shouts in your ear; its chariots  
rumble by; it smiles broadly in your care­  
worn face; it mocks you as you sew the  
shroud; it meets you at the coffin--at the  
grave; and its heavy footsteps tramp up  
and down in the empty rooms from whence  
you have borne your dead. But it comes  
never in the hush of night to wipe away  
your tears!  
Wanted--an angel for heaven! Can you  
look up? Can you hear the splendor of that  
sight? Ten thousand celestial beings, and  
your ow n radiant child-angel in their midst.  
in &#x27;s syes a gloty light,

so often over your cheek. Vainly your anguished glance  
strives to read the dim story of love in those faded orbs.

slumbers for ever. And still the busfcworld knocks at your  
door, and will let you havj no peace. It shouts in your ear.  
.to chariots rumble by ; it smiles broadly in your care-worn  
face ; it mocks you as you sew the shrowd ; it meet« you at  
the coffin, at the grave ; and its heavy footsteps tramp up  
and down, in the empty rooms from whence you have borne  
your dead. But it comes never in tlie hush of night to wipe  
away your tears !  
Wanted—angel for heaven! Can you look up ? Can you  
bear the splendor of that sight? Ten thousand celestial  
beings and your own radiant child-angel in their midst.  
&quot; In his eyes a glory light,  
On his brow a glory crown.&quot;  
Wanted—angel tor heaven ! Cling not too closely to your

The Child Angok   
: Death has chxred those little ej es and forever

knocks at your d-mr, and v ill let you’haye no  
peace. It shouts in your ear, smiles in v«ntr

its heavy footsteps tramp up and down in the  
empty room from whence you have koine voin
