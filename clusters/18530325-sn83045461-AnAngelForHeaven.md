WANTED--AN ANGEL FOR HEAVEN.--And so death closed those little eyes--shrouded their bright glances. O, that the sun would not come streaming in on his shrouded form, as if there were no grief in the world!  
  
How sweetly he sleeps, that little coveted angel! How lightly curl the glossy rings on his white forehead! You could weep your very soul away, to think those cherub lips will never, never unclose. Vainly you clasp and unclasp that passive darling hand that wandered so often over your cheek. Vainly your anguished glance strives to read the dim story of love in those faded orbs. The voice, sweet as winds blowing through wreathed shells, slumbers forever. And still the busy world knocks at your door, and will let you have no peace. It shouts in your ears ; its chariots rumble by; it smiles broadly in your care-worn face ; it mocks you as you sew the shroud ; it meets you at the coffin, at the grave; and its heavy footsteps tramp up and down in the empty rooms from whence you have borne your dead. But it comes never in the hush of night to wipe away your tears !  
  
Wanted--an angel for heaven! Can you look up? Can you bear the splendor of that sight ? Ten thousand celestial beings, and your own radient child in their midst.  
  
&quot;In his eyes a glory light. On his brow a glory crown.&quot;    
  
Wanted--angels for heaven! Cling not too closely to your beautiful treasures, children of earth!  
  
&quot;You have two children,&quot; said I.   
  
&quot;I have four,&quot; was the reply; &quot;two on earth, two in heaven.&quot;  
  
There spoke the mother! Still her&#x27;s! &#x27; only &quot;gone before!&quot; Still remembered, loved, and cherished by the hearth and at the board ; their places not yet filled, even though their successors draw life from the same faithful breast where their dying heads were pillowed.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Safely housed from storm and tempest: no sickness there, nor droping head, nor fading eye, nur weary feet! By the green pastures, tended by the Good Shepherd, linger the little lambs of the heavenly fold.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Earth less attractive! Eternity nearer! invisible cords drawing the maternal soul upwards. &quot;Still small&quot; voices ever whispering come! to the world, weary spirit.  
  
&quot;Two in heaven!&quot;  
  
Mother of angels walk softly! Holy eyes watch thy footsteps, cherub forms bend to I listen! Keep thy spirit free from earth&#x27;s taint; so shalt thou &quot;go to them,&quot; though &quot;they may not return to thee.&quot;

The Child Angel.  
Death has closed those little eyes and forever  
shrouded their bright glances. How sweetly  
she sleeps, that little coveted angel I How  
lightly curl the glossy ringlets on her forehead I  
You could weep your very soul away to think  
those cherub lips will never unclosed. Vainly  
you clasp and unclasp that darling  
hand, that watKiered so often over your cheeks.  
\ ainly your anguished glances strive to read  
the dint story of love in those faded orbs. That  
voice, sweet as winds blowing through wreaths  
and garlands, slumbers forever. And still the  
busy world knocks at your door and w ill let  
you have no peace. It shouts in your ear, smiles  
in your face, meets you at the coffin, at the grave,  
and its heavy footsteps tramp up and down in  
the empty room from whence you have borne  
, your dead. But it comes never in the hush of  
night to wipe away your thars! In the solemn  
silence of the grave we feel the force of that  
sickening sorrow which Langs heavily upon the  
heart as though it would press it down into that  
narrow, space over which the spirit dwells in  
mournful sus) tease. But a brighter vision meets  
the eye. Can you look up ? Can you the  
splendor of that sight ? Ten thousand celestial  
-beings, and your ow n radiant child-angel in the

In her eyes a glory bright.

Two in IIraven.—“You have two chil­  
dren,” said I. “ I have four,” was the re­  
ply, “two on earth and two in heaven.”—  
Thus spoke the mother. Still they are only  
gone before; still remembered, loved and  
cherished by the hearth and at the board;  
their places not yet filled, even though their  
successors draw life from the same faithful  
breast where their dying heads were pillowed.  
Two in heaven safely housed from storm and  
tempest. XL sickness there, nor drooping  
head, nor fading eye, nor weary feet. By  
the green pastures, tended by the good shep­  
herd, linger to the little lambs of the heav­  
eniy fold. Two in heaven ; earth less at­  
tractive ; eternity nearer; invisible cords  
drawing the maternal soul upwards; still  
small voices ever whispering, “Come!” to  
the world-weary sp;rit. Two in heaven.—  
Mother of angels, walk softly; holy eyes  
watch thy footsteps; cherub forms bend to  
listen; keep thy spiri; free from earthly tint.  
So shalt thou go to them, though they may  
not return to thee.—Missionary Messenger
