.  
You may well remember that in the Beginning of our Conferences, before the other Commissioners arriv’d, on your mentioning to me a Retribution for the Loyalists whose Estates had been forfeited, I acquainted you that nothing of that Kind, could be stipulated by us, the Confiscations being made by Virtue of Laws of Particular States, which the Congress had no Power to contravene or dispense with, and therefore could give us no such authority in our Commission. And I gave it as my Opinion and Advice honestly and cordially, that if a Reconciliation was intended, no mention should be made in our Negociations of those People; for they having done infinite Mischief to our Properties by wantonly burning and destroying Farmhouses, Villages, and Towns, if Compensation for their Losses were insisted on, we should certainly exhibit against it, an Account of all the Ravages they had Committed which would necessarily recall to View Scenes of Barbarity that must inflame instead of conciliating, and tend to perpetuate an Enmity that we all profess a Desire of extinguishing.

Your Ministers require that we should receive again into our Bosom those who have been our bitterest Enemies, and restore their Properties who have destroy’d ours: and this while the Wounds they have given us are still bleeding. It is many Years since your Nation expell’d the Stuarts and their Adherents, and confiscated their Estates. Much of your Resentment against them may by this time be abated. Yet if we should propose it and insist as an Article of our Treaty with you, that that Family should be recalled and the forfeited Estates of its Friends restored, would you think us serious in our Professions of earnestly desiring Peace?
