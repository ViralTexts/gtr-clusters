**Keeping One&#x27;s Eyes Open.**  
  
Nobody is more like an honest man than a thorough rogue. When you see a man with a great deal of religion displayed in his shop window, you may depend upon he keeps a very small stock of it within. Do not choose your friend by his looks: handsome shoes often pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments: remember, &quot;Thank you, pussy, and thank you, pussy,&quot; killed the cat. Don&#x27;t believe in the man who talks most; for mewing cats are very seldom good mousers. By no means put yourself in another person&#x27;s power: if you put your thumb between two grinders, they are very apt to bite. Drink nothing without seeing it; sign nothing without reading it, and make sure that it is no more than it says. Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have nothing to lose: lawyers houses are built on fools&#x27; heads. In any business, never wade into water where you cannot see the bottom. Put no dependence upon the label of a bag; and count money after your own kin. See the sack opened before you buy what is in it; for he who trades in the dark asks to be cheated. Keep clear of the man who does not value his own character. Beware of every one who swears; he who would blaspheme the Maker, would make no bones of lying or stealing. Beware of no man more than yourself; we carry our worst enemies within us. When a new opinion or doctrine comes before you, do not bite till you know whether it is bread or a stone; and do not be sure that the gingerbread is good because of the gilt on it. Never shout halloa! till you are quite out of the wood; and don&#x27;t cry fried fish until they are caught in the net. There&#x27;s always time enough to boast—wait a little longer. Don&#x27;t throw away the dirty water till you have got clean; keep on at scraping the roads till you can get better work; for the poorest pay is better than none, and the humblest office is better than being out of imployment. Always give up the road to bulls and madmen; and never fight with a coal-heaver, or contend with a base character, for they will be sure to blacken you.   
  
Neither trust nor contend,    
Nor lay wagers, nor lend,    
And you may depend    
You&#x27;ll have peace to your end,    
—Rev. C. H. Spurgeon.

NUMBER 10.  
Coed Advice, Xhltt.  
Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue. When you se  
a man with a great deal cf religion dis  
played in his shop window, y.. u may­  
depend upon it he keeps a very small  
stock of it within. Do not choose your  
frieud by his looks ; handsome shoes  
often pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t bo foud of  
compliments; remember, &quot;thank you.  
pussy, and thank you, pussy,&quot; killed  
the cat. Don&#x27;t believe in the man who  
talks most; for mewing cat3 are very  
seldom good tuousers. By no means  
put yourself iu another person&#x27;s power ;  
if you put your thumb between two  
grinders, they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign  
nothing without reading it, and make  
sure it means no more than it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have iioth­  
inirtolosj; lawyers&#x27; houses are built  
on fools&#x27; hads. In any business never  
wade into water where you cannot see  
the bottom. Put no dependence upon  
the label of a lug, and count money  
alt. r your own kin. See the sack open  
before you buy what is in it, for he  
who trades in the dark asks to bo cheat  
ed. Keep clear of the man who does  
not value bis own character. Beware  
of every man who swears; he would  
blisphcme the Maker would make no  
bones of lying or stealing. Beware of no  
man were than of yourself; we carry our  
worst enemy with us. When a new

When a new opinion or doctrine

ment.  
Always give up the road to bulls

Good Advice This. —Nobody is more like  
tn honest man than a thorough rogue. When  
you see a man with a great deal of religion dis­  
played in his shop window you may depend  
upon it, he keeps a very small stock of it with­  
in. Do not choose your friend by bis look» ;  
handsome shoes often pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t  
be fond of compliments ; remember, &quot; Thank  
you, pussy, and thank you. pussy,&quot; killed the  
cat. Don&#x27;t believe in the man who talks mo t;  
lor mewing cats are very seldom good mot;* rs.  
  
By no means put yourself in another&#x27;s power ;  
it you put your thumb between two grinders,  
they are very apt to bite. Drink nothing with •  
out seeing it ; sign nothing without reading it,  
and make sure that it means no more than it  
says. D in t goto law unless you have nothing  
to lose; lawyer&#x27;s houses are built on fool&#x27;s  
heads. In any business, never wade into water  
where you cannot see the bottom,  
pendence upon the label of a bag ; and count  
money after your own kin. See the sack open  
before you buy what is in it; for ho who trades  
in the dark nsks to be cheated. Keep clear of  
a man who does not value his own character.  
Beware of every man who swears ; he Who  
would blaspheme the Maker would make  
bones of lying or stealing. Beware of  
more than of yourself; wo carry our worst ene­  
mies with us. When a new opinion of a doc­  
trine comes before you, do not bite till you  
know whether it is bread or stone ; and do not  
be sure the gingerbread is good because of the  
gilt on it. Never shout hallo I till you are  
quite out of the wood ; and neve* cry fried fish  
till they are caught in the net. There is •!­  
ways time enough to boast—wait a little longer.  
Don&#x27;t throw away dirty water till you can get  
better work ; fir the poorest pay is better than  
none, and the humblest office is better than  
being out of employment Always give up the  
road to bulls and madmen, and never fight with  
a coal heaver, or contend with a base character,

Good Advice.  
  
Spurgeon sententious y ex­  
presses a number of thoughts  
&quot;worth remembering,&quot; in the  
following appropriate sentences  
which lie publishes as &quot;advice  
gratis:&quot;  
Nobody is more like an hon­  
est man than a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a  
great deal ot religion display­  
ed in his shop window, you  
may depend upon it he keeps  
a very small stock of it within  
Do not choose your friend  
by his looks ;&quot; handsome shoes  
often pinch the feet.  
Do not be too fond of com­  
pliments ; remember &quot;Thank  
you, pussy, and thank yon, pus  
sy, kill the cat.  
Dont believe the man who  
talks the most, for mewing cats  
are seldom good mousers.  
By no means put yourself in  
another person&#x27;s power. If you  
put your thumb between two  
grinders they are very apt to  
bite.  
Drink nothing without see  
ing if, sign nothing without  
reading it, and make sure that  
it means no more than it says.  
Don&#x27;t ao to law unless yon  
have nothing to lose; lawyers

Good Advice.  
Do not choose your friend by his  
looks; handsome shoes often pinch.the  
feet.  
Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue. When you  
see a man with a great deal of religion  
displayed in his shop window, you  
may depend he keeps a very small  
stock of it within.  
Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments; re­  
member, &quot;Thank you, pussy, and  
thank you, pussy,&quot; killed the &#x27;cat.&quot;  
I)onkt beheve in the man who talks  
most; for mewing cats are seldom  
good mousers.  
By no means put yourself in an  
other&#x27;s power; if you put your thumb  
between two grinders, they are very  
apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it,  
sign nothing without reading it, and  
make sure that it means no more than  
it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have  
nothing to lose; lawyer&#x27;s houses are  
build on fool&#x27;s heads.  
In any business never wade into  
water where you can not see the bot­  
tom.  
Put no dependence upon the label  
of a bag, and count woney after your  
own kin.  
See the sack open before yoa buy  
what is in it; for he who trades in the  
dark asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of the man who does not  
value his own character.  
Beware of the man who swears; he  
who would blaspheme his Maker  
would make no bones of lying and  
stealing.  
Beware of no man more than of  
yourself ; we carry our worst enemies  
with us.  
When a new opinion or a doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you  
know wether it is bread or storw, and  
do not be sure that the gingis-brcad  
is good because of the gilt on it.  
Never shout hallo till you are quitie  
out of the woods, and never cry fried  
fish until they are out of the net.  
T&#x27;hereis always time enough to boast  
-w.it a little longer.  
J)offt throw away dirty water until  
you ;have clean, and keel) on scraping  
the roads till you get better work.  
The poorest bread is better than  
none, and the humblest office is better  
than being out of employment.  
Always give up the road to bulls and  
niadmen, and never fight with a coal  
heaver or contend with a base char­  
acter, for they w~i be sure to blacken  
you.-Exchanle.

Only a Imy.  
Spurgeon’s Advice Gratis.—Nobody is  
more like an honest man than a thorough  
rogue.  
When yon see a man with a great deal of  
re&#x27;igton disi laved in his shop window, yon  
may depend upon it be keejm a very small  
stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend by bis looks  
Handsome shoes often pinch 1 lie feet.  
Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments; rememlter  
“thank yon, pussy, and thank you, pussy,”  
killed the cat.  
Don&#x27;t lielieve the man that, talks most;  
for mewing cats seldom arc very good moils­  
ers.  
By no means put yourself m another per­  
son’s power; if you put, your thumb between  
two grinders they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign  
nothing without reading it, and make sure it  
means no more than it says.  
Don’f go to law unless yon have nothing  
to lose; lawyers’ houses are built on fools&#x27;  
beads.  
In any business never wade into water  
where yon cannot see the bottom.  
Put no dependence in the label of a bag;  
and count the money after your own kin.  
See the sack open before you buy what it  
contains; for he who trades in the dark asks  
to be cheated.  
Keep cl &#x27;ar of the man who does not value  
bis character.  
Beware of the man who swears; be who  
would blaspheme bis Maker would make no  
bones of tying or stealing.  
Beware of no m m more than yourself; w e  
carry onr worst enemies with ns.  
When a new opinion or doctrine comes  
before yon, do not bite till von know whether  
it is bread or stone; and do not be sure that  
the gingerbread is good because of I lie gilt  
on it.  
Never shout halloo! till you are quite out  
of the woods; and never cry fried lisb till  
tbev nfe caught in the net.  
There Is always time to boast—wait a lit­  
tle longer.  
Don’t throw away dirty water till yon  
have got clean; keep on scraping the roads  
till you can get better work, for the poorest  
pay is better than none, and the humblest  
office is belter than lieingout of employment  
Always give up the road to bolls and  
madmen; and never fight with a coal beaver,  
nor contend with a base character, for they  
will he Sltre to blacken von.

been to me. Nobody is more like nn  
honest man than a thorough rogue. When  
you see a man with a great deal of  
religion displayed in his shop window,  
you may depend upon it he keeps a very  
.small stock of it within. Do not choose  
your friend by his looks ; handsome  
shoes often pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t be  
fond of compliments : remember, &#x27; Thnnk  
you, pussy, and thank you, pussy,&#x27;  
killed the cat. Don&#x27;t believe in tbe man  
who talks most ; for mewing cats are  
very seldom good mousers. By no means  
put yourself in another persou&#x27;s power :  
if you put your thumb between two  
grinders, they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it ; sign  
nothing with out reading it, and make  
sure that it mean9 no more than what It  
says. Don&#x27;t go to lavi unless you have  
nothing to lose ; lawyers&#x27; honses are  
built ou fools&#x27; heads. In any business,  
never wade into wnter where you cannot  
see the bottom. Put no dependence upon  
tbe label of a bag ; and count money  
aftor your own kin. See tbe sack opened  
before you buy what is in it ; for he  
who trades iu tbe dark asks to be  
cheated. Keep clear of the mau who does  
not value his own character. Beware of  
everyone who swears : he who would  
blaspheme his Maker would make no boues  
of lying or stealing. Beware of no man  
more than yourself : we carry our worst  
enemies within us. . Whon a new opinion  
or doctrine comes before you,. do not  
bite till you know whether it is bread  
or a stone ; and do not be *uie that the  
gingerbread is good because of the gilt  
on it. Never shout hulloa I till you are  
quite out of the wood ; and don&#x27;t cry  
fried fish till they are caught in the  
net. There&#x27;s always time enough to  
boast— wait a little longer. . Don&#x27;t  
throw away dirty water till yon have got  
clean : keep on at scraping the roads  
till yon can get better work ; for the  
pooreat pay is better than none, and the  
humblest office is better than being out  
of employment. Always give up the toad  
to bulls nnd madmen, and never fight  
with a coalheaver nor conteud with a  
base character ; for they will be sure  
to blacken you. &#x27; Neither trust not  
contend, Nor l»y wngtn, Bcr lend, And  
you may depend You&#x27;ll bare peace to you
