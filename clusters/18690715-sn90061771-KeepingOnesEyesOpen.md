**Keeping One&#x27;s Eyes Open.**  
  
Nobody is more like an honest man than a thorough rogue. When you see a man with a great deal of religion displayed in his shop window, you may depend upon he keeps a very small stock of it within. Do not choose your friend by his looks: handsome shoes often pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments: remember, &quot;Thank you, pussy, and thank you, pussy,&quot; killed the cat. Don&#x27;t believe in the man who talks most; for mewing cats are very seldom good mousers. By no means put yourself in another person&#x27;s power: if you put your thumb between two grinders, they are very apt to bite. Drink nothing without seeing it; sign nothing without reading it, and make sure that it is no more than it says. Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have nothing to lose: lawyers houses are built on fools&#x27; heads. In any business, never wade into water where you cannot see the bottom. Put no dependence upon the label of a bag; and count money after your own kin. See the sack opened before you buy what is in it; for he who trades in the dark asks to be cheated. Keep clear of the man who does not value his own character. Beware of every one who swears; he who would blaspheme the Maker, would make no bones of lying or stealing. Beware of no man more than yourself; we carry our worst enemies within us. When a new opinion or doctrine comes before you, do not bite till you know whether it is bread or a stone; and do not be sure that the gingerbread is good because of the gilt on it. Never shout halloa! till you are quite out of the wood; and don&#x27;t cry fried fish until they are caught in the net. There&#x27;s always time enough to boast—wait a little longer. Don&#x27;t throw away the dirty water till you have got clean; keep on at scraping the roads till you can get better work; for the poorest pay is better than none, and the humblest office is better than being out of imployment. Always give up the road to bulls and madmen; and never fight with a coal-heaver, or contend with a base character, for they will be sure to blacken you.   
  
Neither trust nor contend,    
Nor lay wagers, nor lend,    
And you may depend    
You&#x27;ll have peace to your end,    
—Rev. C. H. Spurgeon.

NUMBER 10.  
Coed Advice, Xhltt.  
Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue. When you se  
a man with a great deal cf religion dis  
played in his shop window, y.. u may­  
depend upon it he keeps a very small  
stock of it within. Do not choose your  
frieud by his looks ; handsome shoes  
often pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t bo foud of  
compliments; remember, &quot;thank you.  
pussy, and thank you, pussy,&quot; killed  
the cat. Don&#x27;t believe in the man who  
talks most; for mewing cat3 are very  
seldom good tuousers. By no means  
put yourself iu another person&#x27;s power ;  
if you put your thumb between two  
grinders, they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign  
nothing without reading it, and make  
sure it means no more than it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have iioth­  
inirtolosj; lawyers&#x27; houses are built  
on fools&#x27; hads. In any business never  
wade into water where you cannot see  
the bottom. Put no dependence upon  
the label of a lug, and count money  
alt. r your own kin. See the sack open  
before you buy what is in it, for he  
who trades in the dark asks to bo cheat  
ed. Keep clear of the man who does  
not value bis own character. Beware  
of every man who swears; he would  
blisphcme the Maker would make no  
bones of lying or stealing. Beware of no  
man were than of yourself; we carry our  
worst enemy with us. When a new  
opinion of a doctrine comes before you  
do not bite till you know whether it is  
oread or a stone : and do not be sure  
that the ginger-brend is good because  
of the gilt on if Never shout, hallo !  
t:ii you are quite out, oi the wood;  
and never cry fried fish til! they are  
cattght in the net. There is always  
time enough to boast wait a Jittic  
longer. Don&#x27;t throw away dirty water  
till you have got eleau ; keep on scrap­  
ing tlie roads tii! you cin better work ;  
for the poorest pay is better than none,  
and the humblest ofilee is better than  
being out of employment. Always  
give up the road t.. bulls and madmen,  
aud never fight with a coal heaver, or  
contend with a base character, for they  
wiil be sure to blacken von. Her. C

Good Advice.—Do not choose your friend

you pussy,” killed the cat. Don’t believe in i

are very seldom good mousers. By no means  
put yourself in another person’s power; if  
you put your thumb between two grinders,  
they are very apt to bite. Drink nothing ;  
without sceiug it; sigu nothing without

See the sack open before you buy what is iu  
it; for he who trades in the dark asks to be  
eheated. Keep clear of the men who does  
not value his• own character. Beware of  
no man more than yourself; we carry our,  
worst enemies with us. When a new opin­  
ion or doctrine comes before you, do not bite  
till you know whether it is bread or stone ,  
and do not bo sure that the giugeibread is  
good because of the gilt on it. Never shout  
hallo! till you are quite out of the woods;  
and never cry fried fish till they arc caught  
in the net. There is always time enough to  
boast—wait a little longer. Don’t throw  
away dirty water till you have got clean;  
keep on scraping the roads till you can get

Women charm, as a general thiug, in pro­

harm. They are gen­  
erally not really true, for these short sleep­  
ers almost invariable take many naps in the  
day time. If not, they are exceedingly reg­  
ular in their other habits, and lose no time  
in wakefulness io bed. It is wise to take  
regular sleep enough to keep the nervous  
system steady and strong.  
Almost as injurious as late hours at night  
is the practice of rising too early io the  
morning. The best alarm clock is sunlight.  
The eyes should not be wearied by artificial  
ight in the morning. If they must bear  
this exposure, let it be just previous to the  
repose of night. *  
  
GOOD ADVICE.  
Keep clear of the man who does not value

wait a little longer.  
Do not choose your friend by his looks ;  
handsome shoes often pinch the feet.  
In any busioess, never wade into water

Beware of no man more than yourself; we  
carry our worst enemies with us.  
Put no dependence upon the label of a  
hag ; and count money after your own kin.  
See the sack open before you buy what is  
in it; for he who trades in the dark asks to  
be cheated.  
Don&#x27;t be too fond of compliments. Re­  
member, &quot;Thank you, pus-y, and tnank

By no means put yourself in another per­

two grinders, they are apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign  
nothiug without reading it, and make sure  
that it means no more than it says.  
Sever shout hallo ! till you are quite out

Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have nothing  
to lose; lawyer&#x27;s houses are built on fools

Beware of any man who swears ; for he  
who would blaspheme the Maker, would  
make no bones of lying or stealing.  
When you see a man with a good deal of  
religion displayed in his shop window, you  
may depend upon it he keeps a very small

THERE are men who by long consulting  
only their own inclination, have forgotten

Beware of no man more than your  
self; we carry our worst enemies with  
us.  
When a doctrine comes before you, do  
m&gt;t bite till you know whether it is bread  
or a stone.  
Never shout hallo, till you are out of  
the woods; never cry fried fish till you  
catch them.  
Tnere is always time to boast, wait a  
little longer.  
Don’t throw away dirtv water till you  
have got clean, the pooiest pay is better  
than none, and the humb’est office is  
better than being out of employment.  
Alwaxs give up the road lo bulls and  
mailmen; and never fight with a coal  
lienver, nor contend with a base charac­  
ter for they will be sure to blacken you.

Spurgeon&#x27;s Advice Gratis.—Nobody  
is more like an honest man thau a thorough  
rogue.  
When you see a man with a great deal  
of religion displayed iv his window, you  
may depend upon it ho keeps a very small  
stock within.  
Do not chooso your friend by his looks ;  
handsome shoes often pinch the foot.  
Do not bo fond of compliments ; remem­  
ber that &quot;thank you, ptis3y, and thank  
you, pussy,&quot; killed tbe cat.  
Don&#x27;t believe the man who talks the  
most ; for mewing cats are very seldom  
good mousers.  
By no means put yourself in another&#x27;s  
person&#x27;s power; if you put your thumb be­  
tween two grinders they are very apt to  
bite.  
Drink nothing without scoing it; sign  
nothing without reading it, and make sure  
that it means no more than it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have nothing  
to lose ; lawyers&#x27; houses are built on fools  
heads.  
Put no dependence on the label of a  
bag; and count money after your own  
kind.  
In any business don&#x27;t wade into water  
where you cannot see the bottom.  
See the sack open before you buy what  
is in it; for he who trades in the dark  
asks to be cheated.

no good res­  
olutions, no good prayers, can translate you  
from fitness for hell to fitness for heaven.—  
Christ alone can do that, and when with  
earnest cry we ask him, he will not refuse.  
His own words are, ‘ Him that cometh unto  
me I will in nciifye cast out.’”&#x27;  
The old shoemaker found this true by  
blessed experience, and now he has gone to  
be forever with the Lord.  
We ask the reader, On which side of this  
line are you?  
Sayings of Spurgeon.  
Spurgeon sententiously expresses a num­  
ber of thoughts “worth remembering” in  
the following appropriate sentences, which  
he publishes as “advice gratis:”  
Nobody is more like an honest man than  
a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a great deal of  
religion displayed in his shop window, you  
may depend upon it he keeps a very small  
stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend by his looks:  
handsome shoes often piuch the feet.  
Do not be fond of compliments; remem­  
ber “thank you, pussy, and thank you,  
pussy,” kill the cat.  
Don’t believe the man who talks the most,  
for mewing cats are very seldom good  
mousers.  
By no means put yourself in another per­  
son’s power; if you put your thumb between  
two grinders, they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign noth­  
ing without reading it; and make sure that  
it means no more than it says.  
Don’t go to law unless you have nothing  
to lose; lawyer’s houses are built on fools’  
heads.  
Put on dependence on the label of a bag,  
  
and count money after your own kind.  
In any business never wade into water  
where you cannot see the bottom.  
See the sack open before you buy what

i to be cheated.

his own character

overtamking those who use it,  
  
Good Advice.  
Do not choose your friend by his  
looks; handsome shoes often pinch.the  
feet.  
Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue. When you  
see a man with a great deal of religion  
displayed in his shop window, you  
may depend he keeps a very small  
stock of it within.  
Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments; re­  
member, &quot;Thank you, pussy, and  
thank you, pussy,&quot; killed the &#x27;cat.&quot;  
I)onkt beheve in the man who talks  
most; for mewing cats are seldom  
good mousers.  
By no means put yourself in an  
other&#x27;s power; if you put your thumb  
between two grinders, they are very  
apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it,  
sign nothing without reading it, and  
make sure that it means no more than  
it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have  
nothing to lose; lawyer&#x27;s houses are  
build on fool&#x27;s heads.  
In any business never wade into  
water where you can not see the bot­  
tom.  
Put no dependence upon the label  
of a bag, and count woney after your  
own kin.  
See the sack open before yoa buy  
what is in it; for he who trades in the  
dark asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of the man who does not  
value his own character.  
Beware of the man who swears; he  
who would blaspheme his Maker  
would make no bones of lying and  
stealing.  
Beware of no man more than of  
yourself ; we carry our worst enemies  
with us.  
When a new opinion or a doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you  
know wether it is bread or storw, and  
do not be sure that the gingis-brcad  
is good because of the gilt on it.  
Never shout hallo till you are quitie  
out of the woods, and never cry fried  
fish until they are out of the net.  
T&#x27;hereis always time enough to boast  
-w.it a little longer.  
J)offt throw away dirty water until  
you ;have clean, and keel) on scraping  
the roads till you get better work.  
The poorest bread is better than  
none, and the humblest office is better  
than being out of employment.  
Always give up the road to bulls and  
niadmen, and never fight with a coal  
heaver or contend with a base char­  
acter, for they w~i be sure to blacken  
you.-Exchanle.

Don&#x27;t believe the man that talks most;

Jiy no means put yourself in another

Drink nothing without seeing it, sign  
nothing without rending it, and make

Put no dependence in the label of a bag;

See the sack open before you buy what

to be cheated.  
Keep clear of the man who does not

Beware of a man who swears; he who

Only a Imy.  
Spurgeon’s Advice Gratis.—Nobody is  
more like an honest man than a thorough  
rogue.  
When yon see a man with a great deal of  
re&#x27;igton disi laved in his shop window, yon  
may depend upon it be keejm a very small  
stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend by bis looks  
Handsome shoes often pinch 1 lie feet.  
Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments; rememlter  
“thank yon, pussy, and thank you, pussy,”  
killed the cat.  
Don&#x27;t lielieve the man that, talks most;  
for mewing cats seldom arc very good moils­  
ers.  
By no means put yourself m another per­  
son’s power; if you put, your thumb between  
two grinders they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign  
nothing without reading it, and make sure it  
means no more than it says.  
Don’f go to law unless yon have nothing  
to lose; lawyers’ houses are built on fools&#x27;  
beads.  
In any business never wade into water  
where yon cannot see the bottom.  
Put no dependence in the label of a bag;  
and count the money after your own kin.  
See the sack open before you buy what it  
contains; for he who trades in the dark asks  
to be cheated.  
Keep cl &#x27;ar of the man who does not value  
bis character.  
Beware of the man who swears; be who  
would blaspheme bis Maker would make no  
bones of tying or stealing.  
Beware of no m m more than yourself; w e  
carry onr worst enemies with ns.  
When a new opinion or doctrine comes  
before yon, do not bite till von know whether  
it is bread or stone; and do not be sure that  
the gingerbread is good because of I lie gilt  
on it.  
Never shout halloo! till you are quite out  
of the woods; and never cry fried lisb till  
tbev nfe caught in the net.  
There Is always time to boast—wait a lit­  
tle longer.  
Don’t throw away dirty water till yon  
have got clean; keep on scraping the roads  
till you can get better work, for the poorest  
pay is better than none, and the humblest  
office is belter than lieingout of employment  
Always give up the road to bolls and  
madmen; and never fight with a coal beaver,  
nor contend with a base character, for they  
will he Sltre to blacken von.

Nobody is more like an honest man

fond of compliments; remember,  
“Thank you, pussy, and thank you,  
pussy,” killed the cat. Don’t believe in  
the man who talks the most, for mewing  
cats are very seldom good mousers.  
By no means put yourself in another  
person’s power; if you put your thumb  
between two grisnders, they are very apt

make sure that it means no more than

have nothing to lose; lawyer’s houses  
are buiit on fools’ heads.  
In any busness, never wade into the

Put no dependence upon the label of a

kin. See the sack open before you buy  
what is in it; for he who trades in the  
dark asks to be cheated. Keep clear  
of the man who does not value his own  
character. Beware of the man who  
swears; he who woould blaspheme the  
Maker would make no bones of lying or  
stealing. Beware of no man more than of  
yourself: we carry our worst enemies  
with us.  
When anew opinion or doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you  
know whether it is bread or stone; and  
do not be sure that the gingerbread is  
good because of the gilt on it. Never  
shout hallo! tijl you are quite out of  
the woods; and never cry fresh fish till  
they are caught in the net. There is  
always time enough to boast—wait a  
little longer. Don’t throw away dirty  
water till you have got clean; keep on  
scraping the roads till you can get better  
work; for the poorest pay is better than  
none, and the humblest office is better  
than being out of employment. Always  
give up the road to bulls and mad-men;  
and never fight with a coal-heaver, or  
contend with a base character; for they  
will be sure to blacken you.—Rev. C. If.

In any busness, never wade into the

and embalm it in grace  
ful memories when dead. Mr. Van­  
derbilt can well afford his hundred  
thousand clollar balls to gratify the  
love of display that usurps the bet  
ter social attainments of life, as that  
would be wasting not more than  
three days&#x27; income ; but if he would  
make the shadows of the gathering  
night resplendent with golden lining,

and leave at least some few of the  
poor and friendless, to keep his mem  
ory gr?en, when those who revel in  
his shoddy gifts shall have speeded  
his parting into forgetfulness.  
GOOD ADVICE.  
Do not choose your friend by his  
looks ; handsome shoes often pinch  
the feet. Do not be fond of compli­  
ments ; remember, &quot;Thank you, pus­  
sy ; and thank you, pussy, killed the  
cat.&quot; Don&#x27;t believe in the man who  
talks most, for mewing cats are very  
seldom good mousers. By no means  
put yourself in another person&#x27;s pow­  
er ; if you put your thumb between  
two grinders it is very apt to be bit­  
ten. Drink nothing without seeing  
it ; sign nothing without reading it,  
and make sure. that it means no more  
than it says. Don&#x27;t go to law unless  
you have nothing to lose ; lawyers&#x27;  
houses are built on fools&#x27; heads. In  
any business never wade into water  
where you cannot see&quot; bottom. Put  
no dependance upon the lable of a  
bag ; and count money before you  
receipt for it. See the sack open be­  
fore you buy what is in it, for he who  
trades in the dark asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of the man who does not  
value his character. Beware of every  
one who swears, for he who would  
blaspheme his Maker would make no  
bones of lying or stealing. Beware  
of no man more than yourself ; we  
carry our worst enemies within us.  
When a new doctrine or opinion  
comes before you do not bite till you  
know whether it is bread or a stone,  
and do not be sure that the ginger­  
bread is good because of the gilt on  
I xt Never shout till you are quite out  
J of the woods, and don&#x27;t cry fried fish  
  
till they are caught in the net. There&#x27;s  
always time enough to boast wait a  
little longer. Don&#x27;t throw awav dir-  
  
ty water till you have got clean. Keep  
on at scraping the roads till you can  
get better work, for the poorest pay  
is better than none, and the humblest  
office is better than being out of em­  
ployment. Always give up the roads  
to bulls and madmen, and never fight  
with a coal heaver or contend with a  
base character, for they will be sure  
to blackeu you. Nobody is more like  
an honest man than a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a great  
deal of religion displayed in his shop  
window, you may depend upon it he  
keeps a very small stock of it within.

ong people of my ac­  
quaintance; many see more with one  
eye than others with two, and many  
have fine eyes and cannot see a jot.  
All heads are not sense boxes.  
Some are so cunning that they sus­  
pect everybody, and so live all their  
lives in a miserable fear of their neigh­  
bors ; others are simple that every knave  
takes them in.  
One man tries to sea through a brick !  
wall and hurts Ins eyes, while another  
finds out a hole in it and sees as far us i  
ha pleases.  
Some work at the mouth of a furnace !  
and are never scorched, and others burn  
their hands at the fire when they only  
mean to warm them.  
Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rouge.  
When you see a man with a great  
deal of religion displayed in his shop  
window you mav depend upon it he  
keeps a very small stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend by his |  
hmks; handsome shoes often pinch the  
feet.  
I) m’t be fond of compliments; re­  
member, “Thank you, pussy, and thank  
you, pussy, killed the cat.”  
D m t believe in the man who talks  
m . t. for mewing cats are seldom good i  
mo users. !  
My no means put yourself in another -  
person&#x27;s power; if you put your thumb !  
between two grinders, they are very |  
apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it, sign j  
nothing without reading it, and make&#x27;  
sure that it means no more than itsiys.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have i  
nothing to lose; lawyer&#x27;s houses are1  
built on fool’s heads.  
In aoy business, never wade into  
water where you cannot see the bottom.  
I&#x27;m no dependence on the label of a  
bug, and count money uftei yoar own  
ken, J  
•See the si&quot;k open before you buy  
what is in it, for he who trades in the 1  
Jark asks to be cheated.  
  
Keep clear of the man who does not  
value his own character.  
Beware of every one who swears ; he  
who would blaspheme his Maker would  
make no bones of lying or stealing.  
Beware of no man more than of  
yourself; we carry our worst enemies  
with us.  
When a new opinion or doctrine  
comes up tefore you, do not bite till you  
know whether it is bread or stone ; and  
do not be sure that the ginger bread is  
good because of the gilt upon it.  
Don&#x27;t cry fresh fish till they are  
caught in the net.  
Be shy of people who are over-polite,  
and don’t be too fast with those who  
are forward and rough.  
When you suspect a design in any­  
thing, be on your guard; set the trap  
as soon as you smell a rat; but mind  
you don’t catch your own fingers in it.  
Have very little to do with a boaster,  
for his beer is all froth ; and though he  
brags that all his goods and even his  
copper kettles ate gold and silver, you  
will find out that a boaster and a liar  
are first cousins
