never wade into water there you cannot see

you may depend upon it he keeps a  
very small stock of it within. Do not  
choose your friend by his looks :  
handsome shoes often pinch the feet.  
Don’t be fond of compliments : re-  
member, ‘‘ Thank you, pussy, and  
thank you, pussy,” killed the cat.  
Don’t believe in the man who talks  
most; for mewing cats are very sel-  
dom good mousers. Byno means put  
yourself in other person’s power : if  
you put your thumb between two  
grinders, they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it;  
sign nothing without reading it, and  
make sure that it means no more  
than it says. Don’t go to law unless  
you have nothing to lose: lawyers’  
houses are built on fools’ heads. In  
any business, never wade into water  
where you cannot see the bottom.  
Put no dependence upon the label of

Keep clear of the man who does not

blaspheme his Maker, would make no  
bones of lying or stealing. Beware  
of no man more than of yourself: we  
carry our worst enemies within us.  
When a new opinion or doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you  
know whether it is bread ora stone;  
and do not be sure that the ginger-  
bread is good because of the gilt on  
it. Never shout halloa! till you are  
quite out of the wood; and don’t cry  
fried fish till they are caught in the  
net. There is always time enough to  
  
278  
  
boast—wait a little longer. Don’t  
throw away dirty water till you have  
got clean: keep on at scraping the  
roads till you can get better work ;

ROMANTIC MARRIaGE.  
  
 e a  
  
From the Albany Knickerbocker, Ang, T,  
  
We have just heard of a rather romantic  
story which has transpired in this city, the  
truth of which we can vouch for, notwith-  
standing its sensational proclivities. A  
few years since, a girl living as a domestic  
in an aristocratic and wealthy family of  
Liverpool, England, won the affections of  
the son of that family. The young min  
became smitten of his inamorata, and re­  
solved upon marrying her. When he made  
his intentions known to his parents, se­  
rious opposition was manifested. The  
girl, although a good one, virtuous and  
honest, was not in keeping with the fam  
ily standing in society. To marry stien  
a one was considered a disgrace in Eng­  
land, especially when the family of  
the young man is of the highest  
blood. Notwithstanding all this, the young  
man cast aside all family ties, and married  
the poor girl of his affections, who was  
only a servant in his father&#x27;s house. The  
result was, that the boy was driven from  
the parental roof, and took up his humble  
abode with his wife. They lived together  
in peace and happiness a long while. A  
son was born out of this marriage. Final­  
ly, the husband of the girl was taken sick  
with that terrible disease, consumption,  
and died, leaving the girl a widow, with  
her child. During the illness of her hus-  
band, the latter received kind considera  
tion at the hands of his parents, although  
they never in person, visited his bedside.  
Soon after the death of her husband  
the widow and child came to this country  
with her father and mother. They set­  
tled in this city. The father and mother  
took up a home for themselves, while the  
widow went out to service in a well-known  
family living on Washington avenue. She  
had been there for a long time, and was  
honored by her employers. Last week she  
recelved a letter, ar nouncing the fact that  
the whole of the estate of her husband&#x27;s  
father, amounting to $500,000, had been  
bequenthed to her son. Arrangements were  
at once perfected, and on Weinesday last,  
the servant girl, accompanied by her father,  
sailed from New York to Liverpool, to look  
after the fortune coming to them.  
  
A PickpOcKET DodgE.  
  
From the Philadelphia Bulletin.  
  
A few words in regard to a favorite method  
adopted by pickpockets, known asknucks&quot;  
to successfully ply their vocation, may  
serve to place the public on their guard  
against the encroach ments of these light­  
fingered gentry. Pickpockets as a general  
thing are tolerably well dressed, and so far  
as outward appearances are concerned,  
might readily pass for gentlemen. Those  
of the fraternity who have inade the pro  
fession a sort of science, dress with scrupu­  
lous neatness, are at times exceedingly  
polite, pleasant in speech, and affect such  
unostentatiousness that they seldom fail to  
make a favorable impression apon society.  
There are others who do not come up to  
this standard; they are simply confederates  
or &quot;palls,&quot; their business being to hide the  
plunder &quot;faked by their superiors. The  
favorite resort of the fraternity of pick­  
pockets for the purpose of pursuing their  
profession was for several years the street  
cars, generally those which started from  
railroad depots immediately after the arri­  
val of trains, or at the places of amusement  
at the time of closing. These thieves  
would select crowded cars, and so well ar­  
ranged were their plans that they never  
came in contact with each other. At the  
present time they deviate a little from the  
old practice. They do not always se­  
leet crowded cars. They get on the  
rear platforms of cars very full,  
and insist upon standing there  
always being ready with some plausible  
excuse, such as &quot;going to get off directly,&quot;  
&quot;only going a couple of squares,&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s  
too hot there.&quot; At such a time their plan  
of operation is as follows. The car stops  
for one or more passengers, who have some  
difficulty in effecting an entrance. The  
srowd opens the way, and as the passenger  
passes onward his hat is pushed from be­  
hind so as to nearly cover his forchead,  
This is so adroitly accomplished by the  
thief as to throw the passenger aforesaid  
off his guard. He puts his hand up to re­  
adjust his tile, and at the same instant the  
scientific &quot;knuck&quot; relieves him of his  
pocket-book or other valuables, which he  
hands to his &quot;pal,&quot; who gets off and disap­  
 The hat tipping business isquite a faver­  
ite practice, although it is not always at­  
tended with success. Persons who meet  
with such an event, either in gotting on  
railroad cars, or while waiting at ticket  
offices in depots or at places of amusement,  
should remember these words of caution.  
In case any one should feel his hat move  
from behind, in the manner above stated,  
whether on a crowded platform or any  
other place, as already indicated, let that  
person immediately turn around to the one  
behind him and say, &quot;I&#x27;m on that myself.&quot;  
After that he may feel perfectly secure from  
further annoyance on that occasion,  
  
The Byron Scandal.  
  
The New York Nation, in commenting  
upo n the story of Mrs. Stowe in regard to  
the separation of Lord and Lady Byron,  
ays.  
We were told the main facts of this his  
tory something more than ten years ago,  
and this was how it was told to us: At  
whatever time the incestuous connection  
between Byron and his sister may have be  
gun, Lady Byron knew nothing of it, as we  
heard the story, until after the birth of her  
child. Some time after that event, proba  
bly about the beginning of January, 1816,  
Byron told her of the intrigue, saying that  
e had never loved any other woman than  
the partner of his guilt. She  
naturaily, supposed it to be a delusion of  
insanity; and it was under this impression  
that she consulted Dr. Baillie about him,  
which is one of his main charges against  
her in his letters and in &quot;Don Juan.&quot; It was  
while under this belief that she wrote the  
playful letter to Byron, after leaving him,  
which is also one of the counts in the in  
dictment against her. After reaching Kirk­  
by Mallory, her father&#x27;s house, she had cer  
tain proofs of the truth of what her hus­  
band had told her, from which time she  
left him for ever.  
 &quot;Now we do not affirm that this version  
of the story is absolutely authentic. We  
tell it as it was told to us; but most certain­  
ly it is inherently more probable than the  
one given by Mrs. Stowe. It is a key to the  
hole mystery, and the solution is greatly  
honorable to Lady Byron. It accounts for  
her silence as to to the cause of the separa-  
tion. Her lips were sealed as long as Mrs.  
Leigh lived. It accounts for her consulta­  
tion with Dr. Baillie, and for her letter after  
leaving Eyron, and before knowing that a  
a separation was inevitable. It accounts,  
too, for Dr. Lushington&#x27;s statements con­  
firming her own, saying that &#x27;a reconcilia-  
tion was impossible, and that if such an  
idea should be entertained he could not,  
professionally or otherwise, take any part  
towards effecting it.&quot;  
  
A MAN WITHOUT A BREASTBOnE.  
  
CurIous Experiments.  
  
The following curious physical pheno­  
mena were exhibited before the American  
Science association in Boston last week.  
Dr. Groux, a native of Hamburg, and at  
present a practicing physician in Brooklyn,  
N.Y., was born without the sturnum or  
breast bone. Dr. J. Baxter Upham, of  
Boston having been intimately acquainted  
for many years with Dr. Groux, has devot­  
ed a number of ingenious experiments by  
which in his case the action of the heart is  
made to manifest itself both to the eyes and  
ears of persons situated at a considerable  
distance. It should be born in mind that  
the action of the heart in Dr. Groux is per  
fectly normal and healthy, while  
the absence of the sturnum renders  
it possible to make certain studies of  
the utmost importance, which are impossi  
ble in the case of the human being as ordi­  
narily constructed. Dr. Groux&#x27;s case has  
been treated of at length in various medical  
journals in Europe, but never has it been  
brought in such a striking manner before  
so large an audience of scientific men.  
The mechanism of the heart is somewhat  
analagous to that of a double-action pump.  
In both cases the machinery, however per­  
fectly it may work, makes some noise. Dr.  
Groux was able to show three distinct mo­  
tions and sounds occurring successively,  
and with a certain rhythm, in every beat of  
the heart, Dr. Groux also exercised  
the power, rarely bestowed, and never  
used without great danger, of stopping  
at will, during a short period, the ac  
tion of his heart. This was done  
this evening to the satisfaction of several  
mendicant men, one of whom was listening  
with the stethoscope at the chest, the two  
others feeling at the wrist for the pulse.  
For about 20 seconds the action of the vital  
organ in the frail chest of Dr. Groux com  
pletely coased. Some years ago there ex  
isted an individual who was wont to exper­  
imenting with himself in this manner, and  
who finally perished through being unable  
to resume the ordinary conditions of human  
existence. Dr. Upham so far from encour  
aging his friend, Dr. Groux, in the repeti­  
tion of this perilous experiment, has ear­  
nestly entreated him never to make the  
venture again. Some years ago, Dr. Groux  
having made up his mind to travel in  
various cities of Europe and America,  
caused Rufus Choate, the renowned lawyer,  
to draw up a will making over his body, in  
the event of his death, to the surgeons for  
dissection. Portions of this will, which is  
a long document composed in Mr. Choate&#x27;s  
happiest vein, were read to the great de­  
light of the audience. The original draft,  
in the inimitable handwriting of Mr.  
Choate himself, was also exhibited. The  
experiments and explanations specially re­  
lating to Dr. Groux were given with great  
clearness by that gentleman, who is a regu­  
larly graduated physician. It is clearly of  
great advantage to science that this rare  
malformation occurs in one who is so well  
qualified to observe the obscure vital pro­  
cesses which it affords an opportunity of  
enjoying.  
  
Paul Clifford Outdone.  
  
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Times  
relates the following incident which is  
vouched for a having recently occurred in  
New York!  
As a capital illustration of the manner in  
which thieves conduct their little well or­  
ganized and apparently quite legitimate  
calling in Gotham a little affair came under  
my observation a few days ago wherein a  
family in the village of Woodside, on the  
Long Island Railroad, were robbed by bur­  
glars of silver plate and jewelry. The de­  
tectives, of course, could obtain no clue  
until a reward was offered for the return of  
the property, which consisted of gifts and  
valued heirlooms in the family. A polite  
note was thereupon received from the gen­  
tlemen burglars oxpressing their regrets at  
the incoavenience of the owners, and offer­  
ing at once to restore the goods, but in re­  
gard for their own necessities, they would  
be compelled to accept the reward offered  
as a compliment to their honesty and pro­  
fessional skill.  
The owner consulted the detective upon  
the propriety of causing the arrest of the  
thieves, but was peremptorily informed that  
such a course was not &quot;honor among  
thieves,&quot; and would end only in increased  
disaster to all concerned, and equivocally  
advised him to take what he could get and  
ask no questions. He accordingly, by ap­  
pointment, entered the smoking-car of an  
afternoon train, and found two nobby  
gents, with fancy kids, white hats, diamond  
pins, and rings, in charge of a basket con­  
taining his lost valuables, and there, in the  
presence of the passengers, who knew  
what was going on, the goods were examin  
ed, the negotiation happily concluded, and  
the money paid. The nonchalant dack  
Sheppard offered their new friend a fifty  
cent Havana, talked merrily and friendly,  
and at the next station bid him goodbye in  
the most polite manner possible. Has fie­  
tion recorded anything more singularly  
cool and refreshing than this? Paul Clif  
ford was a bungler, compared to a New York  
cracksman, and Vidocg&#x27;s office would be al­  
together a sinecure among the metropolitan  
police.  
  
Good Advice, this.  
  
Nobody is more like an honest man than  
a thorough rogue. When you see a man  
with a great deal of religion displayed in  
his shop window, you may depend upon it  
he keeps a very small stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend by his looks;  
handsome shoes often pinch the feet,  
Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments; remember  
Thank you, pussy, and thank you,  
pussy, killed the cat. Dont believe  
in the mian who taiks most; for  
mewing cats are very seldom good  
mousers. By no means put yourself in an­  
other persons power; if you put your thumb  
between two grinders, they are very apt to  
bite. Drink nothing without seeing it, sign  
nothing without reading it, and make sure  
that it means no more than it says. Don&#x27;t  
go to law unless you have nothing to lose;  
lawyer&#x27;s houses are built on fools heads. In  
any business, never wade into water where  
you cannot see the bottom. Put no depend­  
ence upon the label of a bag; and count  
money after your kin. See the sack open  
before you buy what is in it; for he who  
trades in the dark asks to be cheated. Keep  
clear of the man who does not value his  
own character. Beware of the man who  
swears, he who would blaspheme the  
Maker would make no bones of lying or  
stealing. Beware of no man more than of  
yourself; we carry our worst enemies with  
us. When a new opinion of a doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you know  
whether it is bread or a stone; and do not  
be sure that the ginger-bread is good be  
cause of the gilt on it. Never shout  
hallo! till you are quite out of the  
wood; and never cry fried fish until they  
are caught in the net. There is always  
time enough to boast---wait a little longer.  
Don&#x27;t throw away dirty water till you have  
got clean; keep on scraping the roads till  
you can get better work; for the poorest  
pay is better than none; and the humblest  
office is better than being out of employ  
ment. Always give up the road to bulls  
and madmen, and never fight with a coal  
heaver, or contend with a base character,  
for they will be sure to blacken you.--Hev.

IoNOrAnCE AND VICE. From 1849 to 1867  
the number of convicts committed to the  
Albany Penitentiary was 18,392; 13,657  
men, and 4,730 women. Of these 5,661  
could not read; 4,209 could read; 3,452  
could read and write; 2,340 were temper  
ate; 16,047 intemperate; natives of the  
United States, 7,622; foreigners, 10,710,  
Of 3o1 persons committed in 1868, 367  
could read and write, 161 could read only,  
273 could neither read or write; 628 admit  
ted themselves to be intemperate; 173  
claimed to be temperate. These facts, like  
those from all prisons, show that ignorance  
and intemperance are the prolific sources  
of rime  
All &quot;beer gardens&quot; within the jurisdic.  
tion of the Chicago authorities were closed  
on last Sunday, and will not henceforth  
on the Sabbath be allowed to open, Notice  
is being given, also, that all billiard saloons  
and ten-pin alleys must be closed on Sun  
days. The law will be rigidly enforced re  
garding those places. Pancing is alsopro­  
scribed on the Sabbath in public halls,  
gardens, etc.

ible disease, consumption,  
and died, leaving the girl a widow, with  
her cLilil. During the illness of her hus­  
band, the latter received kind considera­  
tion at the hands of his parents, although  
they never in person, visited his bedside.  
Soon after tho death of her husband  
the widow and child came to this country  
with her father aud mother. They set­  
tled in this city. The fatber and mother  
took up a homo for themselves, while the  
widow went out to service in a well-known  
family living on Washington avenue. She  
had been there for a long time, and was  
honored by her employers. Last week she  
received a letter, announcing the fact that  
the whole of the estate of her husband&#x27;s  
father, amounting to £500,000, had been  
bequeathed to her sou. Arrangements were  
at once perfected, and on Wednesday^last,  
the servant girl, accompanied by her father,  
sailed from New York to Liverpool, to look  
after the fortune coming to them.  
  
A Pickpocket llodge.  
From the Philadelphia Bulletin.  
  
A few words in regard to a favorite method  
adoptedby pickpockets, known us &quot;knucks&quot;  
to successfully ply their vocation, may  
servo to place the public on their guard  
against the encroachments of these light­  
fingered gentry. Pickpockets as a general  
thing aro tolerably well dressed, and so far  
as outward appearances are concerned,  
might readily pass for gentlemen. Those  
of the fraternity who have made the pro­  
fession a sort of science, dress with scrupu­  
lous neatness, are at times exceedingly  
polite, pleasant in speech, and affect such  
unostentatiousness that they seldom fail to  
make a favorable impression upon society.  
There are others who do not come up to  
this standard they are simply confederates  
or &quot;palls,&quot; their business being to hide the  
plunder &quot;faked&quot; by their superiors. The  
favorite resort of the fraternity of pick­  
pockets for the purpose of pursuing their  
profession was for several years the street  
cars, generally those which started from  
railroad depots immediately after the arri­  
val of trains, or at the places of amusement  
at the tiine of closing. These thieves  
would select crowded cars,- and so well ar­  
ranged were their plans that they never  
came in contact with each other. At the  
present time they deviate a little from the  
old practice. They do not always se­  
lect crowded cars. They get on the  
rear platforms of cars very full,  
aud jnsj6t upon standing there  
always being ready with some plausible  
excuse, such as &quot;going to get off directly,&quot;  
&quot;only going a couple of squares,&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s  
too hot there.&quot; At such a timp their plan  
of operation is as follows: The car stops  
for one or more passengers,  
who have some  
difficulty in effecting an entrance. The  
crowd opens the way, and as the passenger  
passes onward his hat is pushed from be­  
hind so as to nearly cover his forehead.  
This is so adroitly accomplished by the  
thief as to throw the passenger aforesaid  
off his guard. He puts his hand up to re­  
adjust his tile, and at the same instant the  
scientific &quot;kntick&quot; relieves him of his  
pocket-book or other valuables, which he  
hands to his &quot;pal,&quot; who gets off and disap­  
pears.  
  
The hat-tipping business is quite a favor­  
ite practice, although it -is not always at­  
tended with success. Persons who meet  
with such an event, either in getting on  
railroad oars, or while waiting at ticket  
offices in depots or at places of amusement,  
should remember these words of caution.  
In ease any one should feel his hat move  
from behind, in the manner above stated,  
whether on a crowded platform or any  
other place, as already indicated, let that  
person immediately turn around to the ono  
behind him and say, &quot;I&#x27;m on that myself.&quot;  
After that he may feel perfectly secure from  
further annoyance on that occasion.  
  
The Byron Scandal*  
  
The New York Nation, in commenting  
upon the Btory of Mrs. Stowe in regard to  
the separation of Lord and Lady Byron,  
says:  
  
We were told the main facts of this his­  
tory something more than ten years ago,  
and this was how it was told to us: At  
whatever time the incestuous connection  
between Byron and his sister may have be­  
gun, Lady Byron knew nothing of it, as we  
heard the story, until after the birth of her  
child. Some time after that event, proba­  
bly about the beginning of January, 181G,  
Byron told her of the intrigue, saying that  
be had never loved any other woman than  
the partner of his guilt. She,  
naturally, supposed it to be a delusion of  
insanity and it was under this impression  
that she consulted Dr. Baillie about him,  
which is one of his main charges against  
her in his letters and in &#x27;Don Juan.&#x27; It was  
while under this belief that she wrote the  
playful letter to Byron, after leaving him,  
which is also one of the counts in the in­  
dictment against her. After reaching Kirk­  
by Mallory, her father&#x27;s house, she had cer­  
tain proofs of the truth of what her hus­  
band had told her, from which time she  
left him for ever.  
&quot;Now we do not affirm that this version  
of the story is absolutely authentic. We  
tell it as it was told to us but most certain­  
ly it is inherently more probable than the  
one given by Mrs. Stowe. It is a key to the  
wholo mystery, and the solution is greatly  
honorable to Lady Byron. It acconnts for  
her silence as to to the cause of the separa­  
tion. Her lips were sealed as long as Mrs.  
Leigh lived. It accounts for her consulta­  
tion with Dr. Baillie, and for her letter after  
leaving Byron, and before knowing that a  
a separation was inevitable. It accounts,  
too, for Dr. Lushington&#x27;s statements con­  
firming her own, saying that &#x27;a reconcilia­  
tion was impossible,&#x27; aud that &#x27;if such an  
idea should be entertained he could not,  
professionally or otherwise, take any part  
towards effecting it.&quot;  
  
Good Advice, this.

HIe MARRIAGE.  
  
A DOMESTIe in LUck.  
  
skerbocker, Ang. 21.  
  
We have just heard of a rather romantic  
tory which has transpired in this city, the  
truth of which we, can vouch for, notwith­  
standing its sensational proclivities. A  
fewlyears since, a girl living as a domestic  
in an aristocratic and wealthy family of  
Liverpool, England, won the affections of  
the son of that family. The young man  
became smitten of his inamorata, and re­  
solved upon marrying her. When he made  
his intentions known to his parents, se­  
rious opposition was manifested. The  
girl, although a good one, virtuous and  
honest, was not in keeping with the fam­  
ily standing in society. To marry such  
one was considered a disgrace in Eng  
land, especially when the family of  
the young man is of the highest  
blood. Notwithstanding all this, the young  
man cast aside all family ties, and married  
the poor girl of his affections, who  
only a servant in his father&#x27;s house. The  
result was, that the boy was driven from  
the parental roof, and took up his humble  
abode with his wife. They liyed together  
in peace and happiness a long while. A  
son was born out of this marriage. Final­  
ly, the husband of the girl was taken sick  
with that terrible disease, consumption,  
nd died, leaving the girl a widow, with  
her child. During the illness of her hus-  
band, the latter received kind considera­  
tion at the hands of his parents, although  
they never in person, visited his bedside.  
Soon after the death of her husband  
the widow and child came to this country  
with her father and mother.Ihey e  
in this city. The father and mother  
took up a home for themselves, while the  
widow went out to service in a well-known  
family living on Washington avenue. She  
had been there for a long time, and was  
honored by her employers. Last week she  
recelved a letter, announcing the fact that  
the whole of the estate of her husband&#x27;s  
father, amounting to $500,000, had been  
bequeathed to her son. Arrangements were  
at once perfected, and on Wednesday last,  
the servant girl, accompanied by her father,  
sailed from New York to Liverpool, to look  
fter the fortune coming to them.  
  
A Pickpocket Dodge.  
  
From the Philadelphia Bulletin.  
A few words in regard to a favorite method  
adopted by pickpockets, known as &quot;knucks&quot;  
to successfully ply their vocation, may  
serve to place the public on their guard  
against the encroachments of these light­  
fingered gentry. Pickpockets as a general  
thing are tolerably well dressed, and so far  
as outward appearances are concerned,  
might readily pass for gentlemen. Those  
of the fratornity who have inade the pro-  
fession a sort of science, dress with scrupu-  
lous neatness, are at times exceedingly  
polite, pleasant in speech, and affect such  
unostentatiousness that they seldom fail to  
make a favorable impression upon society.  
There are others who do not come up to  
this standard; they are simply contederates  
or &quot;palls, their business being to hide the  
plunder &quot;faked by their superiors. The  
favorite resort of the fraternity of pick­  
pockets for the purpose of pursuing their  
profession was for several years the street  
 cars, generally those which started from  
railroad depots immediately after the arri­  
val of trains, or at the places of amusement  
at the time of closing. These thieve  
would select crowded cars, and so well ar  
ranged were their plans that they neve  
came in contact with each other. At the  
present time they deviate a little from the  
old practice.They do not always  
lect crowded cars. They get on the  
rear platforms of cars very full,  
and insist, upon standing there  
always being ready with some plausible  
xcuse, such as &quot;going to get off directly.&quot;  
&quot;only going a couple of squares, or &quot;it&#x27;s  
too hot there.&quot; At such a time their plan  
of operation is as follows: The car stops  
for one or more passengers, who have some  
difficulty in effecting an entrance. The  
crowd opens the way, and as the passenger  
passes onward his hat is pushed from be­  
hind so as to nearly cover his forehead,  
This is so adroitly accomplished by the  
thief as to throw the passenger aforesaid  
off his guard. He puts his hand up to re­  
adjust his tile, and at the same instant the  
scientific &quot;knuck&quot; relieves him of his  
pochet book or other valuables, which he  
ands to his &quot;pal,&quot; who gets off and disap­  
The hat tipping business is quite a favor­  
ite practice, although it is not always at­  
tended with success. Persons who meet  
with such an event, either in gatting on  
railroad cars, or while waiting at ticket  
offices in depots or at places of amusement,  
should remember these words of caution.  
In case any one should feel his hat move  
from behind, in the manner above stated,  
whether on a crowded platform or any  
other place, as already indicated, let that  
perion imediately tai arount to the one  
ehind him and say, &quot;I&#x27;m on that myself.&quot;  
After that he may feel perfectly secure from  
further annoyance on that occasion.  
  
The BYron Scandal.  
  
The New York Nation, in commenting  
upo n the story of Mrs. Stowe in regard to  
the separation of Lord and Lady Byron,  
says.  
We were told the main facts of this his  
tory something more than ten years ago,  
and this was how it was told to us: At  
3whatever time the incestuous connection  
between Byron and his sister may have be  
gun, Lady Byron knew nothing of it, as we  
heard the story, until after the birth of her  
child. Some time after that event, proba  
bly about the beginning of January, 1816,  
Byron told her of the intrigue, saying that  
he had never loved any other woman than  
the partner of his guilt. She.  
naturany, supposed it to be a delusion of  
insanity; and it was under this impression  
that she consulted Dr. Baillie about him,  
which is one of his main charges against  
her in his letters and in &#x27;Don Juan.&quot; It was  
while under this belief that she wrote the  
playful letter to Byron, after leaving him,  
which is also one of the counts in the in-  
dictment against her. After reaching Kirk  
by Mallory, her father&#x27;s house, she had cer­  
tain proofs of the truth of what her hus-  
 band had told her, from which time she  
a left him for ever.  
is: &quot;Now we do not affirm that this version  
of the story is absolutely authentic. We  
tell it as it was told to us; but most certain­  
ely it is inherently more probable than the  
one given by Mrs. Stowe. It is a key to the  
 whole mystery, and the solution is greatly  
honorable to Lady Byron. It acconnts for  
her sience as to to the cae of the separa­  
tion. Her lips were sealed as long as Mrs.  
Leigh lived. It accounts for her consulta-  
tion with Dr. Baillie, and for her letter after  
leaving Byron, and before knowing that  
separation wan mevitable. It account,  
too, for Dr. Lushington&#x27;s statements con­  
firi er o sain tat a eoni­  
ation was impossible, and that if such an  
idea should be entertained he could not,  
professionally or otherwise, take any part  
towards effecting it.&quot;  
  
A MAN WITHOUT A BreASTBONE.  
  
Curious Experiments  
  
The following curious physical phene­  
mena were exhibited before the American  
Science association in Boston last week.  
Dr. Groux, a native of Hamburg, and at  
present a practicing physician in Brooklyn,  
N. Y., was born without the sturnum or  
breast bone. Dr. J. Baxter Upham, of  
Boston having been intimately acquainted  
for many years with Dr. Groux, has devot­  
ed a nuniber of ingenious experiments by  
which in his case the action of the heart is  
made to manifest itself both to the eyes and  
ears of persons situated at a considerable  
distance. It should be born in mind that  
the action of the heart in Dr. Groux is per­  
fectly normal and healthy, while  
the absence of the sturnum renders  
it possible to make certain studies of  
the utmost importance, which are impossi­  
ble in the case of the human being as ordi­  
narily constructed. Dr. Groux&#x27;s case has  
been treated of at length in various medical  
journals in Europe, but never has it been  
brought in such a striking manner before  
so large an audience of scientific men.  
The mechanism of the heart is somewhat  
analagous to that of a double-action pump.  
In both cases the machinery, however per­  
fectly it may work, makes some noise. Dr.  
Groux was able to show three distinct mo­  
tions and sounds occurring successively,  
and with a certain rhythm, in every beat of  
the heart.Dr. Groux also exercised  
the power, rarely bestowed, and never  
used without great danger, of stopping  
at will, during a short period, the ac­  
tion of his heart. This was done  
this evening to the satisfaction of several  
mendicant men, one of whom was listening  
with the stethoscope at the chest, the two  
others feeling at the wrist for the pulse.  
For about 20 seconds the action of the vital  
organ in the frail chest of Dr. Groux com­  
pletely coased. Some years ago there ex­  
isted an individual who was wont to exper­  
imenting with himself in this manner, and  
who finally perished through being unable  
to resume the ordinary conditions of human  
existence. Dr. Upham so far from encour­  
aging his friend, Dr. Groux in the repeti­  
tion of this perilous experiment, has ear­  
nestly entreated him never to make the  
venture again. Some years ago, Dr. Groux  
having made up his mind to travel in  
various cities of Europe and America,  
caused Rufus Choate, the renowned lawyer,  
to draw up a will making over his body, in  
the event of his death, to the surgeons for  
dissection. Portions of this will, which is  
a long document composed in Mr. Choate&#x27;s  
happiest vein, were read to the great de­  
light of the audience. The original draft,  
in the inimitable handwriting of Mr.  
Choate himself, was also exhibited. The  
experiments and explanations specially re­  
lating to Dr. Groux were given with great  
clearness by that gentleman, who is a regu­  
larly graduated physician. It is clearly of  
great advantage to science that this rare  
malformation occurs in one who is so well  
qualified to observe the obscure vital pro  
cesses which it affords an opportunity of  
enjoying.  
  
&#x27;aul Clifford Outdone.  
  
A correspondent of the Cincinnatl Times  
relates the following incident which is  
vouched for at having recently occurred in  
New York:  
As a capital illustration of the manner in  
which thieves conduct their little well or­  
ganized and apparently quite legitimate  
calling in Gotham a little affair came under  
my observation a few days ago wherein a  
family in the village of Woodside, on the  
Long Island Railroad, were robbed by bur  
glars of silver plate and jewelry. The de  
tectives, of course, could obtain no clue  
until a reward was offered for the return of  
the property, which consisted of gifts and  
valued heirlooms in the family. A polite  
note was thereupon received from the gen­  
tlemen burglars expressing their regrets at  
the incoavenience of the owners, and offer­  
ing at once to restore the goods, but in re­  
gard for their own necessities, they would  
be compelled to accept the reward offered  
as a compliment to their honesty and pro-  
lessional skill.  
The owner consulted the detective upon  
the propriety of causing the arrest of the  
thieves, but was peremptorily informed that  
such a course was not &quot;honor among  
thieves,&quot; and would end only in increased  
disaster to all concerned, and equivocally  
advised him to take what he could get and  
ask no questions. He accordingly, by ap­  
pointment, entered the smoking-car of an  
afternoon train, and found two nobby  
gents, with fancy kids, white hats, diamond  
pins, and rings, in charge of a basket con­  
taining his lost valuables, and there, in the  
presence of the passengers, who knew  
what was going on, the goods were examin­  
ed, the negotiation happily conciuded, and  
the money paid. The nonchalant Jack  
Sheppard offered their new friend a fifty  
cent Havana, talked merrily and friendly,  
and at the next station bid him good-bye in  
the most polite manner possible. Has fic­  
tion recorded anything more singularly  
cool and refreshing than this? Paul Clif­  
ford was a bungler, compared to a New York  
cracksman, and Vidoc&#x27;s office would be al­  
together a sinecure among the metropolitan  
police.  
  
Good Advice, this.  
  
Nobody is more like an honest man than  
a thorough rogue. When you see a man  
with a great deal of religion displayed in  
his shop window, you may depend upon it  
he keeps a very bmall stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend by his looks;  
handsome shoes often pinch the feet.  
Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments; remember  
Thank you, pussy, and thank you,  
pussy,&quot; killed the cat. Don&#x27;t believe  
in the man who talks most; for  
mewing cats are very seldom good  
mousers. By no means put yourself in an  
other persons power; if you put your thumb  
between two grinders, they are very apt to  
bite. Drink nothing without seeing it, sign  
nothing without reading it, and make sure  
that it means no more than it says. Don&#x27;t  
go to law unless you have nothing to lose;  
lawyer&#x27;s houses are built on fools heads. In  
any business, never wade into water where  
you cannot see the bottom. Put no depend­  
ence upon the label of a bag; and count  
money affer your kin. See the sack open  
before you buy what is in it; for he who  
trades in the dark asks to be cheated. Keep  
clear of the man who does not value his  
own character. Beware of the man who  
swears, he who would blaspheme the  
Maker would make no bones of lying or  
atealing, beware of ho hian more than of  
yourself; we carry our worst enemies with  
us. When a new opinion of a doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you know  
whether it is bread or a stone; and do not  
be sure that the ginger-bread is good be-  
enuse of the git on it. Never shout  
hallo till you are uite out of th  
wood, ald hever ery fried lish until they  
are caught in the net. There is always  
time enough to boabt--walt at little longer.  
Don&#x27;t throw away dirty water till you have  
got clean; keep on scraping the roads till  
you can get better work; for the poorest  
pay is better than none; and the humblest  
omce ie better than being out of employ  
ment. Always give up the road to bulls  
and madmen, and never fight with a coal  
heaver, or contend with a base character,  
for they will be sure to blacken you.Her  
IoNORANCE AND VICE.From 1549 to 186  
the number of convicts committed to the  
Albany Penitentiary was 18,392; 13,657  
men, and 4,40 women. Of these 5,661  
could not read, 4,209 could read; 8,432  
could read and write; 2,345 were tempe.  
ate; 16,047 intemperate; natives of the  
United States, 7,622; foreigners, 10,710,  
Of Sol persons committed in 1868, 367  
could read and write, 161 could read onl  
273 could neither read or write; 628 admit­  
ted themselves to be intemperate; 173  
claimed to be temperate. These facts, like  
those from all prisons, show that ignorance  
and intemperance are the prolific sources  
of crime.  
tion af the Cf smrde nntiithin the jurisdic  
of the Chicago authorities were closed  
on last Sunday, and will not henceforth  
on the Sabbath be allowed to open. Notice  
is being given, also, that all billiard saloons  
and tenpin alleys must be closed on Sun­  
days. The law will be rigidly enforced re­  
garding those places. Dancing is also pro­  
scribed on the Sabbath in public halls,  
gardens, ete.

Good Advice, This.  
Nobody is more like an hon­  
est man ? i a a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a  
great deal of religion display­  
ed in his shop window, you may  
depend upon it he keeps a very  
small stock of it within. Do  
not choose your friend by his  
looks ; handsome shoes often  
pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t be fond  
of compliments ; remember,  
&quot;Thank you pussy, and thank  
you pussy,&quot; killed the cat.—  
Don&#x27;t believe in the man who  
talks most ; for mewing cats  
an seldom good mousers. By  
no means put yourself in an­  
other persons power; if you put  
., , , . , .  
your thumb between two grin­  
, °  
dors, they are very apt to bite,  
r , • T ... - , ,  
Drink nothing without seeing  
... ... . _ f  
it; sign nothing without read­  
ingit, and make sure that it  
means no more than it says.—  
Go not to law r unless you bave  
notiugh to lose. In any business  
never wade into water where •  
you cannot see the bottom.  
Put no dependence upon the  
label of a bag; and count mon­  
ey after your kin. See the sack  
open before you buy what is in  
it ; for he who trades in the  
dark asks to be cheated.. Keep  
clear of the man who does not  
value his own character. Be­  
ware of every man who swears.  
Beware of no man more than  
of yourself; we carry our worst  
enemies with us. When a new  
opinion of a doctrine comes be­  
fore you, do not bite till you  
know whether it is bread or a  
stone; and do not be sure that  
the ginger-broad is good be­  
cause of the gilt on it. Never  
shout hallo ! till you are quite  
out of the wood; and never cry  
fried fish until they are caught  
in the net. There is always  
time enough to boast—wait a  
little longer. Don&#x27;t throw away  
dirty water till you have got  
clean ; keep on scraping the  
roads till you can get better  
work; for the poorest pay is  
better than being out of em­  
ployment. Always give up the  
read to bulls and madmen, aud  
never fight with a coal beaver,  
or contend with a base charac­  
ter, for they will be sure to  
blackeu you.— [C. H. Spurgeon.

fiufjerud gentry, riekpoekets as a general  
thing are tolerably well dressed, and so far  
as onward nppearane.es are concerned,  
mitiht readilv nass fur tentlemeu. Those  
  
ot the fiat t.rnity w ho have made the pro­  
fession a sort of science, dress with scrupu­  
lous neatness, are at times exceedingly  
pobte, pleasant in speech, and affect such  
unostenlationsness that they seldom fail to  
make a favorable, impression upon society.  
There are others who do not come np to  
this staudard; they are simply confederates  
or &quot;palls,&quot; their business being to hide the  
blunder &quot;faked&quot; bv their superiors. &#x27;I he  
  
Uvojito resort of the fraternity of pick­  
pockets for the purpose of pursuing their  
profession was for several years tho street  
cars, generally those which started from  
fail road depots immediately after the arri­  
val of t rains, or at the places of amusement  
at the time of closing. These thieves  
would select crowded cars, and so well ar­  
ranged were their plans that they never  
came iu contact with each other. At the  
present time they deviate a little from tho  
old practice. They do not always se­  
lect crowded cars. They gt on the  
rear platforms of cars very full,  
aud insist upon standing there  
always being ready with some plausible  
excuse, such as &quot;going to get off directly,&quot;  
&#x27;&quot;only going a couple of squares,&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s  
too hot there.&quot; At such a time their plan  
ef operation is as follows: The car stops  
for one or more passengers, who have some  
difficulty in effecting an entrance. The  
crowd opens the. way, and as the passenger  
passes onward his hat is pushed from be­  
hind so as to nearly cover his forehead.  
  
This ik so adroitly accomplished by the  
thief as to throw the passenger aforesaid  
  
off his guard. He puts his hand up to re­  
adjust his tile, and at tho same instant the  
  
Bckntific &quot;knuck&quot; relieves him of his  
pocket-book or other valuables, which he  
  
hands to his &quot;pal,&quot; who gets off and disap  
  
pears  
  
malformation occurs iu ono who is so well  
  
qualified io observe tho obscure vital pro  
  
cesses which it affords an opportunity of  
  
enjoying.  
Paul Clifford Outdone.  
A correspondent of the Cincinnati Times  
relates the following incident which is  
vouched . or at having recently occurred iu  
New York:  
As a capital illustration nt the manner in  
  
which iiiieves conduct tiieir littlo well or­  
ganized and apivareiitly quite legitimate  
calling in Gotham a little affair came under  
my observation a few days ago wherein a  
family iu the village of Woodside, on the  
Long Island Kail road, were iobled by bur  
  
glars of sih&#x27;er plate and jewelry. Tho de­  
tectives, of course, could obtain no clue  
uutil a reward was offered for the return of  
the properly, which consisted of gifts aud  
valued heirhxmis in the family. A polite  
note was thereupon received from the gen­  
tlemen burglars expressing their regret at  
the incowveuieiico of tho owners, and offer­  
ing at once to restore tho goods, but in re­  
gard for their own necessities, they would  
be compelled to accept the reward offered  
as a compliment to their honesty and pro  
  
fessional skill.  
The owner consulted the detective upon  
the propriety ot causing the arrest of the  
thieves, bnt was peremptorily informed that  
such a courso was not &quot;honor among  
thieves,&quot; and would end only in increased  
disaster to all concerned, and equivocally  
advised him to take what he could get and  
ask no questions. He accordingly, by ap  
  
pointment, entered the smoking-car of au  
afternoon train, and found tvvo nobby  
  
cents, with fancy kids, white hats, diamond  
  
pins, ami rings, in cuarge 01 a uasKei. con  
  
taining his lost valuables, and mere, in me  
, i  
  
presence ot tne passengers, wno suew  
  
what was going on, the goods were examin­  
ed, the negotiation happily couclnded, aud  
the money paid. The nonchalant Jack  
Sheppard offered their new friend a fifty  
  
cent Havana, talked merrily and inendiy,  
  
and at the next station bid him good-bye in

The mechanism of the heart is somewhat  
analogous to that of a double-action pump.

Groux was able to show three distinct mo­

mid with a certain rhythm, in every beat of  
  
the heart. Dr. Groux also exercised  
  
the power, rarely bestowed, and never  
used without great danger, of stopping  
at will, during a short period, the ac­  
tion of his heart. This was done  
this evening to the satisfaction of several  
mendicant men, one of.whom was listening  
with the stethoscope at tlie chest, thetwo  
others feeling at the-wrist for the pulse.  
For about &#x27;20 seconds the action of the vital

vouched ior at having recently occurred in  
  
New York:  
  
As a capital illustration nt the manner in  
  
which thieves conduct their little well or  
  
gauized and apparently qnito legitimate  
  
calling in Gotham.a little affair came under  
  
my observation a few days ago wherein a  
  
family in the village of Woodside, on the  
  
Long Island llailroad, were lobbed by bur  
  
glars of silver plate and jewelry. Tho de  
  
tectives, of course, could obtain no clue  
until a reward was offered for the return of  
the property, which consisted of gifts and  
valued heirlooms in tho fatuity. A polite  
note was thereupon received from tho gen­  
tlemen burglars expressing their regrets at  
the inconvenience of the owners, and offer­  
ing at once to restore the goods, but in re­  
gard for their own necessities, they would  
  
be compelled to accept tho reward offered  
as a compliment to their honesty and pro­  
fessional skill.  
The owner consulted the detective upon  
the propriety ot causing the arrest ot the  
thieve.s,but was peremptorily informed that  
such a course was not &quot;honor among  
thieves,&quot; and would end only in increased  
disaster to all concerned, and equivocally  
advised hini to take what he could get and  
  
ask no questions. lie accordingly, by ap  
  
pointment, entered the smoking-car ot an

gents&#x27;, with fancy kids, white hats, diamond  
pius, and rings, in charge of a basket con­  
taining his lost valuables, and there, in the  
presence of the passengers, who knew  
what was going on, the goods were examin  
  
ed, the &#x27;negotiation happily concluded, and  
the money paid. Tlie nonchalant Jack

Nobody is more like an honest man than  
a thorough rogue. When yon see a man  
with a great deal of religion displayed in  
his shop window, you may depend upon it  
ho keeps a very small stock of it within.

&quot;Thank you. pussy, and - thank you,  
pussy,&quot; killed the &#x27; cat. Don&#x27;t believe  
in tho man who talks most; for  
mewing cats are very seldom good  
  
monsers. By no means put yourself iu an  
  
other persems power; if you put your thumb  
  
belwHcu two grinders, they are very apt to  
  
bite. Drink nothing without seeing it, sign  
  
nothing without reading it, aud make sure  
  
that it means no more than it say s. Don&#x27;t  
  
go to law unless you have nothing to lose;  
lawyer&#x27;s houses are built on fools heads. In  
  
any business, never wade into water whero  
  
you cannot see the bottom. Put no depend­  
ence upon the label of a bag; and count  
  
I money after j-our kin. See the sack open  
  
ln-fore you buy what is in it; for 1k who  
  
trades in the dark asks to be cheated. Keep  
clear of tho. man who does not value his  
  
own character, lie ware of the man who  
  
swears, he who would blaspheme the  
  
Maker would make no bones of lying or  
  
stealing. Beware of no man more than of  
  
yourself; we carry our worst enemies with  
us. When a new opinion of a doctrine  
comes before you, elonot bite till yon know  
whether it is bread or a stono; and do not  
bo sure that tho ginger-bread is good be­  
cause of tho gilt on it Never shout  
hallo! till you are quite out of the  
wood; and never cry fried fish until they  
are caught in tho net. There is always  
time enough to boast wait a little loiiiier.  
  
Don&#x27;t throw; away dirty water till you have  
  
got clean; keep on scraping the roads till  
  
you can get better work ; for the poorest  
pay is better than none; and the humblest  
  
office is better than being out of employ­  
ment Always give up the road to bulls  
  
anil madmen, and never fight with a coal

The Ufron Scaud.il.  
The New York Nation, in commenting  
  
npo n the story of Mrs. Stowe in regard to  
the separation of Lord and Ijiuly Byron,  
says:  
  
We ,wero told the main facts of this his  
  
tory something more thau te n years ago,  
and this was how it was told to us: At  
  
whatever time the incestuous connection  
betweeu Byron and his sister may have lie­  
gnu, Iidy Byron knew nothiug of it, as w e  
heard the story, until alter the birth of her  
child. Some time after that event, proba­  
bly altout the beginning of January, 1HH,  
Byron told her of the intrigue, saying that  
he had never loved any other woman than  
the partner of his gnilf. She,  
naturally, supposed it to be a delusion of  
insanity; and it was under this impression  
that she consulted Dr. Baillio alsiut him,  
which is one of his main charges against  
  
her in hin letters aud in &#x27;Don Juan.&#x27; It was  
while Under this belief that she wrote the  
  
playful letter to Byron, alter leaving him.  
  
which is also one of the count in the in­  
dictment against her. After reaching Kirk-  
  
by Mallory, her father&#x27;s house, sho had cer-  
  
tvin proofs of the truth of what her hns-  
  
Wand hail told her, from which time sho  
  
left hitn for ever.  
  
rtow we do not amrm mat tins version  
  
of the! story is absolutely authentic. We  
  
tell it as it was told to us; but most certun-  
  
y it is inherently more probable than the  
  
one given by Mrs. Stowo. It is a key to tho  
  
whole &#x27;mystery, anel the solution is greatly  
  
honorable to Lady Byron. It jveconnts for  
  
her silence as to to the canse of tho separa­  
tion. Her lip9 were sealed as long as Mrs.  
  
Leighilived. It accounts for her consulta  
  
tion with Dr. Baillie, and for her letter after  
leaving Byron, and before knowing that a  
  
a separation was inevitable. It acconnts,  
  
too, for Dr. Liushingtou s statements con  
  
firming her own, saying that a reconcilia­  
tion vias impossible,&#x27; and that &#x27;if auch an  
idea should be entertained ho could not,  
professionally or otherwise, take any port  
towards effecting it&quot;

learof the man who does net value his

gion in his shop window, you may  
depend upon it that he keeps a very

Don&#x27;t believe in the man that talks  
most, for mewing cats are seldom  
good mousers.  
Drink nothing without seeing it;  
sign nothing without reading it, and  
make sure it means no more than it  
says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have  
no&#x27;hing to lose , lawyer&#x27;s houses are  
built on fools&#x27; heads.  
In any business, never wade in  
water where youcannot see the bot­  
tom.Count money before you receipt  
for it.  
- See the sack opened before you  
buy what is in it, for be who trades

Keep clear of the man who doe  
not value bis own character.  
Beware of do man mora than your­

When a new opinion or doctrine

you know whether it is bread or a

geon&#x27;s Advice GratI  
  
Nobody is more like an  
honest man than a thorough  
rogue.  
When you see a man with a  
great deal of religion displayed  
in his shop window, you may  
depend upon it he keeps a  
very smal stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend  
by his looks: handsome shoes­  
often pinch the feet.  
Do not be fond of compli­  
ments, remember &quot;thank you,  
pussy, and thank you pussy,&quot;  
killed the cat.  
Don&#x27;t belive the man who  
talks the most, for mewing  
cats are very seldom good  
mousers.  
By no means put yourself in  
another person&#x27;s power; if you  
put your thumb between two  
grinders, they are very apt to  
bite.  
Drink nothing without see­  
ing it; sign nothing without  
reading it; and make sure that  
it means no more than it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you  
have nothing to lose, lawyers&#x27;  
houses are built on fools&#x27; heads.  
Put no dependence on the  
label of a bag, and count mon­  
ey after your own kind.  
In any business never wade  
into water where you cannot

See the sack open before you

Don’t believe the man who talks mot;  
fur mewing cats are very seldom good  
mouse rs.  
By no means put yonrself iu another  
person’s power; if you put your thumb  
between two grinders they are very apt  
to bite.  
Drink nothing withous seeing it—sign  
nothing without reading it, and be sure  
it means no more than it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have noth  
in* to lose; lawyers houses are built with  
fools money,  
In any business do not wads into water  
where you cannot see the bottom.  
Pul no dependence upon the label of  
a bag, ami count the money after your  
own kin.  
See the sack open before you buy  
what is in it; for he who trades in the  
daik asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of the man who does not

Beware of any man that swears; he  
who blasphemes his Maker might lie or  
swear false.  
Beware of no man more than your  
self; we carry our worst enemies with  
us.  
When a doctrine comes before you, do  
m&gt;t bite till you know whether it is bread  
or a stone.  
Never shout hallo, till you are out of  
the woods; never cry fried fish till you  
catch them.  
Tnere is always time to boast, wait a  
little longer.  
Don’t throw away dirtv water till you  
have got clean, the pooiest pay is better  
than none, and the humb’est office is  
better than being out of employment.  
Alwaxs give up the road lo bulls and  
mailmen; and never fight with a coal  
lienver, nor contend with a base charac­  
ter for they will be sure to blacken you.

Keeping One’s Eyes Open.  
  
Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue. When you see  
a@ man with a great deal of religion dis-  
played in his shop window, you may  
depend upon it he keeps a very small  
stock of it within. Do not choose your  
friend by his looks: handsome shoes  
often pinch the feet. Don’t be fond of  
compliments: remember, ‘‘ Thank you,  
pussy, and tnank you, pussy,” killed  
the cat. Don’t believe in the man who  
talks most: for mewing cats are very  
seldom good mousers. By no means  
put yourself in another person’s power:  
if you put your thumb between two  
grinders, they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign  
nothing without reading it, and make  
sure that it means no more than it says.  
Don’t go to law unless you have noth-  
ing to lose: lawyers’ houses are built on  
fools’ heads. In any business, never  
wade into water where you cannot see  
the bottom. Put no dependence upon  
the label of a bag; and count money  
after your own kin. See the sack open-  
ed before you buy what is in it; for he  
who trades in the dark asks to be  
cheated. Keep clear of the man who  
does not value his own character. Be-  
were of every one who swears; he who  
would blaspheme his Maker, would  
make no bones. of lying or stealing.  
Beware of no man more than of yourself:  
we carry our worst enemies-within us.  
When a new opinion or doctrine comes  
before you, do not bite till you know  
whether it is bread or a stone; and do  
not be sure that the gingerbread is good  
because of the gilt on it. Never shout  
halloa! till you are quite out of the  
wood; and don’t cry fried fish till they  
are caught in the net. There’s always  
time enough to boast — wait a little  
longer. Don’t throw away dirty water  
till you have got clean; keep on at scrap-  
ing the roadg. fill you can get better  
work; for the poorest pay is better than  
none, and the humblest office is better  
than being out of employment. Always  
give up the road to bulls and madmen;  
and never fight with a coalheaver, or  
contend with a base character, for they  
will be sure to blacken you.  
Neither trast nor contend,  
Nor lay wagers, nor lend,  
  
And you may depend  
You’ll have peace to your end.  
—Rev. C. H. Spurgeon.

Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a great deal  
of religion displayed in his shop window  
you may depend upon it he keeps a very  
small stock of ft within.  
  
Do not choose your friend by his  
  
looks: handsome shoes often pinch the  
  
feet.  
Drink nothing without seeing it, sign  
  
nothing without reading it, and make  
  
sure that it means no more than it says.  
  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have noth­  
ing to lose; lawyers&#x27; houses are built on  
fools&#x27; heads.  
Put no dependence on the label of a  
bag, and count money after your own  
kind.  
In any business never wade into water  
where you cannot see the bottom.  
See the sack open before you buy  
what is in it, for he who trades in the  
dark asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of a man who does not val­  
ue his own character.  
Hold on to your tongue when you are  
just ready to swear, lie or speak harshly,  
or use an improper word.  
Hold on to your hand when you are  
about to strike, pinch, steal or do an  
improper act!  
Hold on to your foot when you are  
on the point of kicking, running away  
from study or pursuing the path of er­  
ror, or shame, or crime.  
Hold on to your temper when you  
  
are angry, excited or imposed upon, or  
others are angry about you.  
Hold on to your hearts when evil as­  
sociates seck your company and invite  
  
you to join in their mirth and revelry.  
Hold on to your name at all times, for  
it is of more value to you than gold,

and  
beauty, cannot be surpassed. I. E. M.  
SPURGEON’S ADVICE GRATIS.  
Nobody is more like an honest man than a  
thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a great deal of re­  
ligion displayed in his shop-window, you may  
depend upon it he keeps a very small stock in­  
side.  
Do not choose your friend by his looks; hand­  
some shoes very often pinch the feet.  
Do not be fond of compliments; remember  
that “ Thank you, pussy,” and “ Thank you,  
pussy,” kill the cat.  
Don’t believe the man who talks the most, for  
mewing cats are very seldom good mousers.  
Bv no means put yourself in another person’s  
power; if you put your thumb between two  
grinders, they arc very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign nothing  
without reading it; and make sure it means no  
more than it says.  
Don’t go to law unless you have nothing to  
lose ; lawyer’s houses are built on fools’ heads.  
Put no&quot; dependence on the label of a bag, and

Sayings of Spurgeon.  
Spurgeon sententiously expresses a num­  
ber of thoughts “worth remembering” in  
the following appropriate sentences, which  
he publishes as “advice gratis:”  
Nobody is more like an honest man than  
a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a great deal of  
religion displayed in his shop window, you  
may depend upon it he keeps a very small  
stock of it within.  
Do not choose your friend by his looks:  
handsome shoes often piuch the feet.  
Do not be fond of compliments; remem­  
ber “thank you, pussy, and thank you,  
pussy,” kill the cat.  
Don’t believe the man who talks the most,  
for mewing cats are very seldom good  
mousers.  
By no means put yourself in another per­  
son’s power; if you put your thumb between  
two grinders, they are very apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it; sign noth­  
ing without reading it; and make sure that  
it means no more than it says.  
Don’t go to law unless you have nothing  
to lose; lawyer’s houses are built on fools’  
heads.

In any business never wade into water

i to be cheated.

handsome shoes often pinch.the

Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue. When you  
see a man with a great deal of religion  
displayed in his shop window, you  
may depend he keeps a very small  
stock of it within.  
Don&#x27;t be fond of compliments; re­  
member, &quot;Thank you, pussy, and  
thank you, pussy,&quot; killed the &#x27;cat.&quot;  
I)onkt beheve in the man who talks  
most; for mewing cats are seldom  
good mousers.  
By no means put yourself in an  
other&#x27;s power; if you put your thumb  
between two grinders, they are very  
apt to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it,  
sign nothing without reading it, and  
make sure that it means no more than  
it says.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have  
nothing to lose; lawyer&#x27;s houses are  
build on fool&#x27;s heads.  
In any business never wade into  
water where you can not see the bot­  
tom.  
Put no dependence upon the label  
of a bag, and count woney after your  
own kin.  
See the sack open before yoa buy  
what is in it; for he who trades in the  
dark asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of the man who does not  
value his own character.  
Beware of the man who swears; he  
who would blaspheme his Maker  
would make no bones of lying and  
stealing.  
Beware of no man more than of  
yourself ; we carry our worst enemies  
with us.  
When a new opinion or a doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you  
know wether it is bread or storw, and  
do not be sure that the gingis-brcad  
is good because of the gilt on it.  
Never shout hallo till you are quitie  
out of the woods, and never cry fried  
fish until they are out of the net.  
T&#x27;hereis always time enough to boast  
-w.it a little longer.  
J)offt throw away dirty water until  
you ;have clean, and keel) on scraping  
the roads till you get better work.  
The poorest bread is better than  
none, and the humblest office is better  
than being out of employment.  
Always give up the road to bulls and  
niadmen, and never fight with a coal  
heaver or contend with a base char­  
acter, for they w~i be sure to blacken  
you.

Good Advice, Thir.  
Nobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue. When you  
see a man with a great deal of religion  
displayed in his shop window, you  
may depend upon it he keeps a very  
small stock of it within. Do not choose  
your friend by his looks; handsome  
shoes often pinch the feet, Don’t be  
fond of compliments; remember,  
“Thank you, pussy, and thank you,  
pussy,” killed the cat. Don’t believe in  
the man who talks the most, for mewing  
cats are very seldom good mousers.  
By no means put yourself in another  
person’s power; if you put your thumb  
between two grisnders, they are very apt  
to bite. Drink nothing without seeing  
it; sign nothing without reading it, and  
make sure that it means no more than  
it says, Don’t go fo law unless you  
have nothing to lose; lawyer’s houses  
are buiit on fools’ heads.  
In any busness, never wade into the  
water where you cannot see the bottom.  
Put no dependence upon the label of a  
bag; and count money after your own  
kin. See the sack open before you buy  
what is in it; for he who trades in the  
dark asks to be cheated. Keep clear  
of the man who does not value his own  
character. Beware of the man who  
swears; he who woould blaspheme the  
Maker would make no bones of lying or  
stealing. Beware of no man more than of  
yourself: we carry our worst enemies  
with us.  
When anew opinion or doctrine  
comes before you, do not bite till you  
know whether it is bread or stone; and  
do not be sure that the gingerbread is  
good because of the gilt on it. Never  
shout hallo! tijl you are quite out of  
the woods; and never cry fresh fish till  
they are caught in the net. There is  
always time enough to boast—wait a  
little longer. Don’t throw away dirty  
water till you have got clean; keep on  
scraping the roads till you can get better  
work; for the poorest pay is better than  
none, and the humblest office is better  
than being out of employment. Always  
give up the road to bulls and mad-men;  
and never fight with a coal-heaver, or  
contend with a base character; for they  
will be sure to blacken you.—Rev. C. If.

t-purgeon  
sententiously expresses  
number of thoughts &quot;worth remember  
ing in the following appropriate sen­  
tences, which he publishes as &quot;advice

Nobody is more like an honest man than  
a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a great deal  
of religion displayed in his shop window.  
you may depend upon it that he keeps  
a viy Mxiaii siock wiitnn.

Don&#x27;t believe the man who talks the

By no means put yourself in another  
person s power. It you put your thumb  
between two grinders they are very apt  
to bite.  
Drink nothing without seeing it, sign  
nothing without, and make sure that it  
means no more than it savs.  
Don&#x27;t go to law unless you have nothing  
to lose, lawyers houses are built on fools  
heads.  
Put no dependence on the label of a  
bag, and count money after your own  
kind.  
If in any business never wade into  
water when you cannot see the bottom.  
See the sack open before you buy what  
is in it ; lor he who trades in the dark  
asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of a man who does not  
value his own character.  
The I If m an Face a Mask. So inscruta  
ble may the human face become that  
frequently it is but a mask which con­  
ceals the real character. Tlie men and  
women most famous for heartless cruelty  
have often been celebrated for their  
handsome faces; writers of fiction have  
not been unmindful of the fact, and Faust  
is represented as being a handsome man ;  
while the German fishermen sing of the  
sirens who drag men&#x27;s soulsdown to per­  
dition with their fatal dower of beauty.  
Some faces are unreadable, and show­  
nothing of the owner&#x27;s character. The  
merriest men now and then have solemn  
faces, and the most serious frequently  
have cheerful ones.

with those who ore forward and rough.  
When you suspect a design in anything,

his beer is all froth, and though ho

will soon find out that a boaster and a  
liar are first cousins. Commit all your  
secrets to no man ; trnst in God with  
nil you heart, but let yon confidence in  
friends bo weighed in the balances of  
prudenco, seeing that men aro but men,  
and all men aro frail. Trust not great  
weights to slender threads. Yet bo not  
overmoro suspicious, for suspicion is  
cowardly at best. Men are not angels,

through this worl d&#x27;ii ani muiist look  
about him, and even sleep wiithbido eye  
open; for there are many baits for  
fishes, many nets for birds, and mani  
traps forin men. While foxes are  
soiconimmon wb must not boe goose. There  
is a very; great differonco in this  
matter among people of my acquaintancc;  
many see more with one eye than others  
with two, and many have fine eyes and  
cannot see a jot. All heads are not  
sense-boxes. Some are so cunning that  
they suspect everybody, and live all  
their lives in misorakle fear of their  
neighbors ; others are so sittple that  
every, knave , takes them in and makes  
his penny of them. One man tries to see  
through a brick .wall and hurts his  
eyes; while another finds &#x27; out a hole  
in it and sees as far as he pleases.  
Some work at the mouth of a furnace and  
are never scorched; and others burn  
their hands at the fire whlen they only  
mean to ,;warm them. Now, it is true  
that no one1, can give another  
experience, and we must s- all, pick up  
wit for ourselves; yet I shall • venture  
to give some of the homely cautions:

Advice.  
Xobody is more like an honest man  
than a thorough rogue.  
When you see a man with a great  
deal of religion displayed in his shop  
window, you may depend upon it that  
he keeps a very low stock within  
Io not choose 3-our friend by his  
looks ; handsome shot&#x27;s often pinch the  
feet.  
Uo not be fond of compliments; re  
member &quot;Thank you, pussy, and thank  
you, pussy,&quot; killed the cat.  
Uon&#x27;t believe the man w ho talks the  
most for mewing cats are seldom good  
mousers.  
By no means put yourself iu another  
person&#x27;s jiow er. If you put your thumb  
between two grinders they are very  
apt to bite.

C.  seon.  
On KeepINg ONE&#x27;s EYEs OpEN.  
To get through this world a man must  
look about him, and even sleep with one eye  
open; for there are many baits for fishes,  
many nets for birds, and many traps for men.  
While foxes are so common we must not be  
geese. There is a very great difference in  
this matter among people of my acquaint­  
ance; many see more with one eye than  
others with two, and many have fine eyes  
and cannot see a jot. All heads are not  
sense-boxes. Some are so cunning that they  
suspect everybody, and so live all their lives  
in miserable fear of their neighbors; others  
are so simple that every knave takes them  
in, and makes his penny of them. One man  
tries to see through a brick wall, and hurts  
his eyes; while another finds out a hole in  
it, and sees as far as he pleases. Some work  
at the mouth of a furnace, and are never  
scorched; and others burn their hands at the  
fire when they only mean to warm them.  
Now, it is true that no one can give another  
experience, and we must all pick up wit for  
ourselves; yet I shall venture to give some  
of the homely cautions which have served  
my turn, and perhaps they may be of use to  
others as they have been to me.  
  
Nobody is more like an honest man than  
a thorough rogue. When you see a man with  
a great deal of religion displayed in his shop  
window, you may depend upon it he keeps a  
very small stock of it within. Do not choose  
your friend by his looks; handsome shoes  
often pinch the feet. Don&#x27;t be fond of com­  
pliments; remember, &quot;Thank you, pussy,  
and thank you, pussy,&quot; killed the cat.  
Don&#x27;t believe in the man who talks most;  
for mewing cats are very seldom good mous­  
ers. By no means put yourself in another  
person&#x27;s power; if you put your thumb be­  
tween two grinders, they are very apt to  
bite. Drink nothing without seeing it; sign  
nothing without reading it, and make sure  
that it means no more than it says. Don&#x27;t  
go to law unless you have nothing to lose;  
lawyers&#x27; houses are built on fools&#x27; heads. In  
any business, never wade into water where  
you cannot see the bottom. Put no depend­  
ence upon the label of a bag; and count  
money after your own kin. See the sack  
opened before you buy what is in it for he  
who trades in the dark asks to be cheated.  
Keep clear of the man who does not value  
hs own character. Beware of every one  
who swears; he who would blaspheme his  
Maker would make no bones of lying or steal­  
ing. Beware of no man more than of your-  
self; we carry our worst enemies within us.  
When a new opinion or doctrine comes be­  
fore you, do not bite till you know whether  
it is bread or a stone; and do not be sure  
that the gingerbread is good because of the  
gilt on it. Never shout hollo! till you are  
quite out of the wood; and don&#x27;t cry fried  
fish till they are caught in the net. There&#x27;s  
always time enough to boast-wait a little  
longer. Don&#x27;t throw away dirty water till  
you have got clean; keep on at scraping the  
roads till you can get better work; for the  
poorest pay is better than none, and the  
humblest office is better than being out of  
employment. Always give up the road to  
bulls and madmen; and never fight with a  
coal-heaver or contend with a base charac­  
ter; for they will be sure to blacken you.  
&quot;Neither trust nor contend,  
Nor lay wagers, nor lend,  
And you may depend  
You&#x27;ll have peace to your end.&quot;  
I cannot say quite so much as that old rhyme  
does, for there&#x27;s more than that wanted to  
give peace, but certainly it will help to it.  
Never ride a broken-kneed horse; the trader  
who has once been a fraudulent bankrupt is  
not the man for you to deal with. A rick­  
ety chair is a dangerous seat. Be shy of  
people who are over-polite, and don&#x27;t be too  
fast with those who are forward and rough.  
When you suspect a design in anything, be  
on your guard; set the trap as soon as you  
smell a rat, but mind you don&#x27;t catch your  
own fingers in it. Have very little to do with  
a boaster, for his beer is all froth, and though  
he brags that all his goods, and even his cop­  
per kettles, are gold and silver, you will soon  
find out that a boaster and a liar are first  
cousins. Commit all your secrets to no man;  
trust in God with all your heart, but let  
your confidence in friends be weighed in the  
balances of prudence, seeing that men are  
but men, and all men are frail. Trust not  
great weights to slender threads. Yet be  
not ever-more suspicious, for suspicion is a  
cowardly virtue at best. Men are not  
angels, remember that; but they are not dev­  
ils, and it is too bad to think them so.
