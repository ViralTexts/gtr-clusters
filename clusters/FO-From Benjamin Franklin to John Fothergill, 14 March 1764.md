Philada. March 14. 1764.  
I received your Favour of the 10th. of Decemr. It was a great deal for one to write, whose Time is so little his own. By the way, When do you intend to live? i.e. to enjoy Life. When will you retire to your Villa, give your self Repose, delight in Viewing the Operations of Nature in the vegetable Creation, assist her in her Works, get your ingenious Friends at times about you, make them happy with your Conversation, and enjoy theirs; or, if alone, amuse yourself with your Books and elegant Collections? To be hurried about perpetually from one sick Chamber to another, is not Living. Do you please yourself with the Fancy that you are doing Good? You are mistaken. Half the Lives you save are not worth saving, as being useless; and almost the other Half ought not to be sav’d, as being mischievous. Does your Conscience never hint to you the Impiety of being in constant Warfare against the Plans of Providence? Disease was intended as the Punishment of Intemperance, Sloth, and other Vices; and the Example of that Punishment was intended to promote and strengthen the opposite Virtues. But here you step in officiously with your Art, disappoint those wise Intentions of Nature, and make Men safe in their Excesses. Whereby you seem to me to be of just the same Service to Society as some favourite first Minister, who out of the great Benevolence of his Heart should procure Pardons for all Criminals that apply’d to him. Only think of the Consequences!  
You tell me the Quakers are charged on your side the Water with being by their Aggressions the Cause of this War. Would you believe it, that they are charg’d here, not with offending the Indians, and thereby provoking the War, but with gaining their Friendship by Presents, supplying them privately with Arms and Ammunition, and engaging them to fall upon and murder the poor white People on the Frontiers? Would you think it possible that Thousands even here should be made to believe this, and many Hundreds of them be raised in Arms, not only to kill some converted Indians supposed to be under the Quakers Protection, but to punish the Quakers who were supposed to give that Protection? Would you think these People audacious enough to avow such Designs in a public Declaration sent to the Governor? Would you imagine that innocent Quakers, Men of Fortune and Character, should think it necessary to fly for Safety out of Philadelphia into the Jersies, fearing the Violence of such armed Mobs, and confiding little in the Power or Inclination of the Government to protect them? And would you imagine that strong Suspicions now prevail, that those Mobs, after committing 20 barbarous Murders, hitherto unpunish’d, are privately tamper’d with to be made Instruments of Government, to awe the Assembly into Proprietary Measures? And yet all this has happen’d within a few Weeks past!  
More Wonders! You know I don’t love the Proprietary, and that he does not love me. Our totally different Tempers forbid it. You might therefore expect, that the late new Appointment of one of his Family, would find me ready for Opposition. And yet when his Nephew arriv’d our Governor, I consider’d Government as Government, paid him all Respect, gave him on all Occasions my best Advice, promoted in the Assembly a ready Compliance with everything he propos’d or recommended; and when those daring Rioters, encourag’d by the general Approbation of the Populace, treated his Proclamations with Contempt, I drew my Pen in the Cause, wrote a Pamphlet (that I have sent you) to render the Rioters unpopular; promoted an Association to support the Authority of the Government and defend the Governor by taking Arms, sign’d it first myself, and was followed by several Hundreds, who took Arms accordingly; the Governor offer’d me the Command of them, but I chose to carry a Musket, and strengthen his Authority by setting an Example of Obedience to his Orders. And, would you think it, this Proprietary Governor did me the Honour, on an Alarm, to run to my House at Midnight, with his Counsellors at his Heels, for Advice, and made it his Head Quarters for some time: And within four and twenty Hours, your old Friend was a common Soldier, a Counsellor, a kind of Dictator, an Ambassador to the Country Mob, and on their Returning home, Nobody, again. All this has happened in a few Weeks!  
More Wonders! The Assembly receiv’d a Governor of the Proprietary Family with open Arms, address’d him with sincere Expressions of Kindness and Respect, open’d their Purses to him, and presented him with Six Hundred Pounds; made a Riot Act and prepar’d a Militia Bill immediately at his Instance; granted Supplies and did every thing that he requested, and promis’d themselves great Happiness under his Administration. But suddenly, his dropping all Enquiry after the Murderers, and his answering the Deputies of the Rioters privately and refusing the Presence of the Assembly who were equally concern’d in the Matters contain’d in their Remonstrance, brings him under Suspicion; his Insulting the Assembly without the least Provocation, by charging them with Disloyalty and with making an Infringement on the King’s Prerogatives, only because they had presumed to name in a Bill offered for his Assent, a trifling Officer (somewhat like one of your Toll-Gatherers at a Turn pike) without consulting him; and his refusing several of their Bills, or proposing Amendments needlessly disgusting; these Things bring him and his Government into sudden Contempt; all Regard for him in the Assembly is lost; all Hopes of Happiness under a Proprietary Government are at an End; it has now scarce Authority enough left to keep the common Peace; and was another Mob to come against him, I question whether, tho’ a Dozen Men were sufficient, one could find so many in Philadelphia, willing to rescue him or his Attorney-General, I won’t say from Hanging, but from any common Insult. All this, too, has happened in a few Weeks!  
In fine, every thing seems in this Country, once the Land of Peace and Order, to be running fast into Anarchy and Confusion. Our only Hopes are, that the Crown will see the Necessity of taking the Government into its own Hands, without which we shall soon have no Government at all.  
Your civil Dissensions at home give us here great Concern. But we hope there is Virtue enough in your great Nation to support a good Prince in the Execution of Good Government, and the Exercise of his just Prerogatives, against all the Attempts of Unreasonable Faction.  
I have been already too long. Adieu, my dear Friend, and believe me ever Yours affectionately  
B Franklin

they are cliarged here, not with ol-

and murder the poor white jKople on  
tlie frontierr ? Would you think it  
(anssible that tlmusaiids even here  
slmuld be raoile to believe this,—and  
many hundriHls of them be raised in  
arms not only to kill some converted  
Indians supposed to be under the  
QuakiT&#x27;s protection, but to tnmish the  
Quakers who were suppoutl to give  
that protectioii ? Would you think  
these people audacious enough to avow  
such designs in a public declaration  
sent to the govemnient? Would you  
imagine that innocent Quakers, men  
of fortune and character, should think  
it nect*ssar^ to fly for safety out of  
Pliiiaddphui into tlie Jerseys, fearing  
the violence of such armed mobs, and  
confiding little in the power or tne/t-  
mUM cf the governmetU to protect  
them } And would you imagine that  
strong suspicions now prevail, that  
these mobs, afier committing twenty  
  
Decameron* [[Nov,  
  
barbarous murders hitherto unpunish-  
ctl, are privately tampered with to be  
made instruments of Government to  
awe the Assembly into proprietory  
measures And yet all this has hap-  
jiened within a few weeks past!  
  
More wonders ! You know that  
I don’t love the proprietor, and that  
he docs not love me. Our totally dit-  
ferent tempers forbid it. You might,  
therefore, expect that the late new aj)-  
|K)intment of one of his family would  
find me ready for opposition; and yet  
when his nephew arrived our gover¬  
nor, I considered government as go¬  
vernment ; paid him all respect; gave  
him on all occasions my best advice;  
promoted in the Assembly a ready  
compliance with every thing he pro¬  
posed or recommended; and wdicn  
those daring rioters, encouraged by  
the general approbation of the pop!u-  
lace, treated his proclamations with  
contempt, I drew my pen in the cause,  
—wrote a namphlet (that I sent you)  
to render ine rioters unpopular; pro¬  
moted an association to support the  
authority of government, and defend  
the governor, by taking arms,—signed  
it first myself, and was followed by  
several hundreds, who took arms ac¬  
cordingly; the governor offered me  
the command of them, but I chose to  
carry a musket, and strengthen his  
authority by setting an example of  
obt&#x27;dience to his orders. And would  
you think it, this proprietory gover¬  
nor did me the honour, on an abrm,  
to run to my house at midnight, with  
his counsellors at his heels, for advice,  
and made it his head-quarters for  
some time, and within four and twen¬  
ty hours your old friend was a com¬  
mon soldier,—a counsellor,—a kind  
of dictator,—^an ambassador to the  
country mob,—^andon their returning  
home— Nobody again All this hap-  
  
l&gt;encd within a few weeks.  
  
More wonders ! The Assembly  
received a governor of the proprietory  
family with open arms, aa4resse&lt;l  
him with sincere expre^ons of kind¬  
ness and respect, opened their puf^  
to him, and presented him #iih  
L. 600, made a r!ot-tuil, and prepared  
a militia bill immetTfatcly at hfe in¬  
stance, granted su 2 )pUcs^ and thd every  
thing he requested, andpromi^dtbto-  
aelves great happiness under his&#x27;ad¬  
ministration. But suddenly, his drop¬  
ping all inquiry oiler tlie murderers,  
and his answenng the di&#x27;paties of the  
  
  
  
Ih20.3 &#x27;rhe Modtr  
  
rioters privately, and refusing the  
presence of the Assembly, who were  
equally concerncil in the matters con¬  
tained in their remonstrance, brings  
him under suspicion; his insulting  
the Assembly without the least pro¬  
vocation, by charging them with dis¬  
loyalty, and with makinfir an in fringe¬  
ment on the kin^*s prerofrativeSt—only  
because they had presumed to name  
(in a bill oifei&#x27;ed for his assent) a  
trifling officer, (something like! one of  
your toll-gatherers at a turnpike,)  
without consulting him, and his re¬  
fusing several of their bills, or pro-  
l&gt;osing amendments needlessly dis¬  
gusting:—These things bring him and  
his government into sudden contempt;  
all regard for him in the Assembly is  
lost ; all hopes of happiness under  
proprietory government are at an end.  
It has now scarce authority enough  
left to keep the common peace; and  
was another mob to come against him,  
  
I question whether, though a dozen  
men were sufficient, one could find so  
many in Philadelphia willing to res¬  
cue him or his Attorney-General, I  
won&#x27;t say from hanging, but from any  
common insult. All this too has ha])-  
IKued in a few weeks !  
  
“In fine, every thing seems in this  
country, once the land of peace and  
order, to be running fast into anarchy  
and confusion.  
  
“ I have been tdready too long. A-  
dieu, my dear friend, and believe me  
ever your’s affectionately,
