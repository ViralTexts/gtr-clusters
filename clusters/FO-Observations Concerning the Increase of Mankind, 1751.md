rica, and on Francis Place, who studied these and others of Franklin’s ideas on population. Adam Smith is known to have had two copies of the essay in his library.  
  
Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c.  
1. Tables of the Proportion of Marriages to Births, of Deaths to Births, of Marriages to the Numbers of Inhabitants, &amp;c. form’d on Observaions made upon the Bills of Mortality, Christnings, &amp;c. of populous Cities, will not suit Countries; nor will Tables form’d on Observations made on full settled old Countries, as Europe, suit new Countries, as America.  
2. For People increase in Proportion to the Number of Marriages, and that is greater in Proportion to the Ease and Convenience of supporting a Family. When Families can be easily supported, more Persons marry, and earlier in Life.  
3. In Cities, where all Trades, Occupations and Offices are full, many delay marrying, till they can see how to bear the Charges of a Family; which Charges are greater in Cities, as Luxury is more common: many live single during Life, and continue Servants to Families, Journeymen to Trades, &amp;c. hence Cities do not by natural Generation supply themselves with Inhabitants; the Deaths are more than the Births.  
4. In Countries full settled, the Case must be nearly the same; all Lands being occupied and improved to the Heighth: those who cannot get Land, must Labour for others that have it; when Labourers are plenty, their Wages will be low; by low Wages a Family is supported with Difficulty; this Difficulty deters many from Marriage, who therefore long continue Servants and single. Only as the Cities take Supplies of People from the Country, and thereby make a little more Room in the Country; Marriage is a little more incourag’d there, and the Births exceed the Deaths.  
5. Europe is generally full settled with Husbandmen, Manufacturers, &amp;c. and therefore cannot now much increase in People: America is chiefly occupied by Indians, who subsist mostly by Hunting. But as the Hunter, of all Men, requires the greatest Quantity of Land from whence to draw his Subsistence, (the Husbandman subsisting on much less, the Gardner on still less, and the Manufacturer requiring least of all), The Europeans found America as fully settled as it well could be by Hunters; yet these having large Tracks, were easily prevail’d on to part with Portions of Territory to the new Comers, who did not much interfere with the Natives in Hunting, and furnish’d them with many Things they wanted.  
6. Land being thus plenty in America, and so cheap as that a labouring Man, that understands Husbandry, can in a short Time save Money enough to purchase a Piece of new Land sufficient for a Plantation, whereon he may subsist a Family; such are not afraid to marry; for if they even look far enough forward to consider how their Children when grown up are to be provided for, they see that more Land is to be had at Rates equally easy, all Circumstances considered.  
7. Hence Marriages in America are more general, and more generally early, than in Europe. And if it is reckoned there, that there is but one Marriage per Annum among 100 Persons, perhaps we may here reckon two; and if in Europe they have but 4 Births to a Marriage (many of their Marriages being late) we may here reckon 8, of which if one half grow up, and our Marriages are made, reckoning one with another at 20 Years of Age, our People must at least be doubled every 20 Years.  
8. But notwithstanding this Increase, so vast is the Territory of North-America, that it will require many Ages to settle it fully; and till it is fully settled, Labour will never be cheap here, where no Man continues long a Labourer for others, but gets a Plantation of his own, no Man continues long a Journeyman to a Trade, but goes among those new Settlers, and sets up for himself, &amp;c. Hence Labour is no cheaper now, in Pennsylvania, than it was 30 Years ago, tho’ so many Thousand labouring People have been imported.  
9. The Danger therefore of these Colonies interfering with their Mother Country in Trades that depend on Labour, Manufactures, &amp;c. is too remote to require the Attention of Great-Britain.  
10. But in Proportion to the Increase of the Colonies, a vast Demand is growing for British Manufactures, a glorious Market wholly in the Power of Britain, in which Foreigners cannot interfere, which will increase in a short Time even beyond her Power of supplying, tho’ her whole Trade should be to her Colonies: Therefore Britain should not too much restrain Manufactures in her Colonies. A wise and good Mother will not do it. To distress, is to weaken, and weakening the Children, weakens the whole Family.  
11. Besides if the Manufactures of Britain (by Reason of the American Demands) should rise too high in Price, Foreigners who can sell cheaper will drive her Merchants out of Foreign Markets; Foreign Manufactures will thereby be encouraged and increased, and consequently foreign Nations, perhaps her Rivals in Power, grow more populous and more powerful; while her own Colonies, kept too low, are unable to assist her, or add to her Strength.  
12. ’Tis an ill-grounded Opinion that by the Labour of Slaves, America may possibly vie in Cheapness of Manufactures with Britain. The Labour of Slaves can never be so cheap here as the Labour of working Men is in Britain. Any one may compute it. Interest of Money is in the Colonies from 6 to 10 per Cent. Slaves one with another cost £30 Sterling per Head. Reckon then the Interest of the first Purchase of a Slave, the Insurance or Risque on his Life, his Cloathing and Diet, Expences in his Sickness and Loss of Time, Loss by his Neglect of Business (Neglect is natural to the Man who is not to be benefited by his own Care or Diligence), Expence of a Driver to keep him at Work, and his Pilfering from Time to Time, almost every Slave being by Nature a Thief, and compare the whole Amount with the Wages of a Manufacturer of Iron or Wool in England, you will see that Labour is much cheaper there than it ever can be by Negroes here. Why then will Americans purchase Slaves? Because Slaves may be kept as long as a Man pleases, or has Occasion for their Labour; while hired Men are continually leaving their Master (often in the midst of his Business,) and setting up for themselves. § 8.  
13. As the Increase of People depends on the Encouragement of Marriages, the following Things must diminish a Nation, viz.  
1. The being conquered; for the Conquerors will engross as many Offices, and exact as much Tribute or Profit on the Labour of the conquered, as will maintain them in their new Establishment, and this diminishing the Subsistence of the Natives discourages their Marriages, and so gradually diminishes them, while the Foreigners increase. 2. Loss of Territory. Thus the Britons being driven into Wales, and crowded together in a barren Country insufficient to support such great Numbers, diminished ’till the People bore a Proportion to the Produce, while the Saxons increas’d on their abandoned Lands; ’till the Island became full of English. And were the English now driven into Wales by some foreign Nation, there would in a few Years be no more Englishmen in Britain, than there are now People in Wales. 3. Loss of Trade. Manufactures exported, draw Subsistence from Foreign Countries for Numbers; who are thereby enabled to marry and raise Families. If the Nation be deprived of any Branch of Trade, and no new Employment is found for the People occupy’d in that Branch, it will also be soon deprived of so many People. 4. Loss of Food. Suppose a Nation has a Fishery, which not only employs great Numbers, but makes the Food and Subsistence of the People cheaper; If another Nation becomes Master of the Seas, and prevents the Fishery, the People will diminish in Proportion as the Loss of Employ, and Dearness of Provision, makes it more difficult to subsist a Family. 5. Bad Government and insecure Property. People not only leave such a Country, and settling Abroad incorporate with other Nations, lose their native Language, and become Foreigners; but the Industry of those that remain being discourag’d, the Quantity of Subsistence in the Country is lessen’d, and the Support of a Family becomes more difficult. So heavy Taxes tend to diminish a People. 6. The Introduction of Slaves. The Negroes brought into the English Sugar Islands, have greatly diminish’d the Whites there; the Poor are by this Means depriv’d of Employment, while a few Families acquire vast Estates; which they spend on Foreign Luxuries, and educating their Children in the Habit of those Luxuries; the same Income is needed for the Support of one that might have maintain’d 100. The Whites who have Slaves, not labouring, are enfeebled, and therefore not so generally prolific; the Slaves being work’d too hard, and ill fed, their Constitutions are broken, and the Deaths among them are more than the Births; so that a continual Supply is needed from Africa. The Northern Colonies having few Slaves increase in Whites. Slaves also pejorate the Families that use them; the white Children become proud, disgusted with Labour, and being educated in Idleness, are rendered unfit to get a Living by Industry.  
14. Hence the Prince that acquires new Territory, if he finds it vacant, or removes the Natives to give his own People Room; the Legislator that makes effectual Laws for promoting of Trade, increasing Employment, improving Land by more or better Tillage; providing more Food by Fisheries; securing Property, &amp;c. and the Man that invents new Trades, Arts or Manufactures, or new Improvements in Husbandry, may be properly called Fathers of their Nation, as they are the Cause of the Generation of Multitudes, by the Encouragement they afford to Marriage.  
15. As to Privileges granted to the married, (such as the Jus trium Liberorum among the Romans), they may hasten the filling of a Country that has been thinned by War or Pestilence, or that has otherwise vacant Territory; but cannot increase a People beyond the Means provided for their Subsistence.  
16. Foreign Luxuries and needless Manufactures imported and used in a Nation, do, by the same Reasoning, increase the People of the Nation that furnishes them, and diminish the People of the Nation that uses them. Laws therefore that prevent such Importations, and on the contrary promote the Exportation of Manufactures to be consumed in Foreign Countries, may be called (with Respect to the People that make them) generative Laws, as by increasing Subsistence they encourage Marriage. Such Laws likewise strengthen a Country, doubly, by increasing its own People and diminishing its Neighbours.  
17. Some European Nations prudently refuse to consume the Manufactures of East-India. They should likewise forbid them to their Colonies; for the Gain to the Merchant, is not to be compar’d with the Loss by this Means of People to the Nation.  
18. Home Luxury in the Great, increases the Nation’s Manufacturers employ’d by it, who are many, and only tends to diminish the Families that indulge in it, who are few. The greater the common fashionable Expence of any Rank of People, the more cautious they are of Marriage. Therefore Luxury should never be suffer’d to become common.  
19. The great Increase of Offspring in particular Families, is not always owing to greater Fecundity of Nature, but sometimes to Examples of Industry in the Heads, and industrious Education; by which the Children are enabled to provide better for themselves, and their marrying early, is encouraged from the Prospect of good Subsistence.  
20. If there be a Sect therefore, in our Nation, that regard Frugality and Industry as religious Duties, and educate their Children therein, more than others commonly do; such Sect must consequently increase more by natural Generation, than any other Sect in Britain.  
21. The Importation of Foreigners into a Country that has as many Inhabitants as the present Employments and Provisions for Subsistence will bear; will be in the End no Increase of People; unless the New Comers have more Industry and Frugality than the Natives, and then they will provide more Subsistence, and increase in the Country; but they will gradually eat the Natives out. Nor is it necessary to bring in Foreigners to fill up any occasional Vacancy in a Country; for such Vacancy (if the Laws are good, § 14, 16) will soon be filled by natural Generation. Who can now find the Vacancy made in Sweden, France or other Warlike Nations, by the Plague of Heroism 40 Years ago; in France, by the Expulsion of the Protestants; in England, by the Settlement of her Colonies; or in Guinea, by 100 Years Exportation of Slaves, that has blacken’d half America? The thinness of Inhabitants in Spain is owing to National Pride and Idleness, and other Causes, rather than to the Expulsion of the Moors, or to the making of new Settlements.  
22. There is in short, no Bound to the prolific Nature of Plants or Animals, but what is made by their crowding and interfering with each others Means of Subsistence. Was the Face of the Earth vacant of other Plants, it might be gradually sowed and overspread with one Kind only; as, for Instance, with Fennel; and were it empty of other Inhabitants, it might in a few Ages be replenish’d from one Nation only; as, for Instance, with Englishmen. Thus there are suppos’d to be now upwards of One Million English Souls in North-America, (tho’ ’tis thought scarce 80,000 have been brought over Sea) and yet perhaps there is not one the fewer in Britain, but rather many more, on Account of the Employment the Colonies afford to Manufacturers at Home. This Million doubling, suppose but once in 25 Years, will in another Century be more than the People of England, and the greatest Number of Englishmen will be on this Side the Water. What an Accession of Power to the British Empire by Sea as well as Land! What Increase of Trade and Navigation! What Numbers of Ships and Seamen! We have been here but little more than 100 Years, and yet the Force of our Privateers in the late War, united, was greater, both in Men and Guns, than that of the whole British Navy in Queen Elizabeth’s Time. How important an Affair then to Britain, is the present Treaty for settling the Bounds between her Colonies and the French, and how careful should she be to secure Room enough, since on the Room depends so much the Increase of her People?  
23. In fine, A Nation well regulated is like a Polypus; take away a Limb, its Place is soon supply’d; cut it in two, and each deficient Part shall speedily grow out of the Part remaining. Thus if you have Room and Subsistence enough, as you may by dividing, make ten Polypes out of one, you may of one make ten Nations, equally populous and powerful; or rather, increase a Nation ten fold in Numbers and Strength.  
And since Detachments of English from Britain sent to America, will have their Places at Home so soon supply’d and increase so largely here; why should the Palatine Boors be suffered to swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours? Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion.  
24. Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.

cupied in that branch, it will ‘alfo be  
foon deprived of fo many people. 4.  
Lols of food. Suppofe a nation has a  
  
latids  
  
fithery; w hich net —_ employs great  
nuinbers, ae makes the food aad fub-  
fifteuce of the poor cheaper: If anc-  
  
nother nation becomes mafter of the  
feas, and preven ts the fthery, the peo-  
ple will d¢tmintih nt proportion as the  
tofs of employ; and dearnefs of provi-  
ion, makes it more difficult to fabék  
a a family . 5. Bad government and in-  
fecure property. People not only leave  
fuch a country, and fettling abroad in-  
corporate with other nations, lofe their  
native language, and become foreign-  
exs; but the indu ftry of thofe that re-  
main being diicouraged, the quantit  
rea lubfitten ice in the country is lefien&#x27;d,  
and th fupport of a family becomes  
more c ‘ticule. So heavy taxes tend to  
diminifh a peopie. 6. The introduc-  
tion of Slaves. The Negroes brought  
into the Enxslifh faugar “iilands, have  
gre itly diminifhed the whites there ;  
he pocr are by this means deprived  
of employmen t, while a few tamilies  
acquire valt eitates. The whites who  
have flaves, not labouring, are enfee-  
bled, and therefore not fo prolific ; the  
flaves being work’d too hard, and ill  
ft: d, their conttitutions are broken, and  
the deaths among them are more than  
the births; fo that a continual fupply  
is needed from Africa. The northern  
colonies having few flaves increafe in  
whites.  
15. Hence the ‘prince that acquires  
new territory, if he finds it vacant, or  
emoves the natives to give his own  
pe paren’ room ; the legiflator that makes  
_ eftcetual laws. tor “promoting trade,  
increafing employment, improving land  
by more or better tillage; providing  
more food by fitheries, fecuring’ pro-  
perty, &amp;c. and the man that mvents  
new trade 9s, arts or manufactures, or  
new improvements in husbandry, may  
be properly called Fathers otf their na-  
tio, as they are the caufe ‘of ‘the ge-  
neration of ‘multitudes, by the encou-  
ragement they afford to marriage.

le beyond the meaas, provided for

16. Foreign, juxuries, and, needlefs  
manufactures imported and afed ina  
nation, do, by the fame reafoning, in-  
creafe the people of the nation’ that  
furnifhes them, and dimtuith the, peo-  
ple of the wation that ufes ;them.—  
Laws therefore that prevent, {uch im-  
portations, and on the contrary pro-  
mote the exportation of manufactures  
to be confumed in foreign countries,  
may be called sexerative laws, as by  
increafing fubfiftence they encourage  
marriage.  
  
17. Some European nations prudent-  
ly refufe to confume the mannfactures  
of Ecf-India:—They thould jikewife  
forbid them to their cobonies ;. tor the  
gain to the merchant is not to be com-  
par&#x27;d with the lofs, by this means, ot  
people to the nation. 3  
  
18.. Home luxury in the Great, in-  
creafes the nation’s manufacturers em-  
ploy’d by it, who are. many, and oniy  
tends to diminith the families that in-  
dulge in it, who are few. The great-  
  
  
  
- er the common fathionable expence of  
  
any rank of ipeople, the more cantioys  
they are of masriage. ‘Therefore lux-  
ury fhould never be fuffered to become  
common.  
  
13. The great increafe of offspring  
in particular families, is not always  
owing to greater fecundity of nature,  
but iometimes to exampi-¢s of induitry  
in the heads, and induttrious educa-  
tion ; by which the children are en-  
abled to provide better {or themielves,  
and their marrying early is encouraged  
from the profpeét of good sulsfiitence.  
  
29. It there be .a 1eét therefore, in  
our nation, that regards frugality and  
induftry as religious duties, and edu-  
cates their’chiidsen therein, more than  
others.commoutry do; fuch tect muit  
eacreafe more.than any other.  
  
21. Fhe importation of foreigners  
into a country that has as many inha-  
bitants as the prefent employments and  
provifions will bear; wili be in the end  
no encreafe of people; uniels the new

lity than: the natives, and then they  
will provide more {ubiittence, and. in-

years exportation of flaves, that. has  
blacken’d half America ?  
  
22. There is in fhort, no bound to  
the prolifick nature of plants..er ani-  
mals, but what is made by their crowd-  
ing and intefering with each other&#x27;s  
means of fubfiftence. Was the face of  
the earth vacant of other plants, it  
might be gradually fowed and over-  
{pread with one kind only ; as, for in-  
itance, with fennel; and were it empty  
of other inhabitants, it might in afew  
ages be repienifhed from one nation  
only ; as, for inttance, with  Exgli/b-  
mex. Thus there are.fuppofed to be  
now upwards of one million Back/.  
fouls in North-America, (though it is  
thought icarce eighty thoufand have  
been brought over fea) and yet,. per-  
haps, there is not one the fewer ip  
Britain, but rather many more, on ac-  
count of the employment the colonies  
attord to manufacturers at, loime,  
This million doubling, fuppofe but  
once in twenty-five years, will in an-  
other century be more than the people  
of England, and the greatelt number  
ct Exglifimen wiil be. on this fide tie  
water. We have been here,butlitiie  
more than one hundred years, and yet  
the force of our privateers in the iate  
war was greater, both in men and  
guns, than that of the whole Brit  
navy in queen Elizabeth&#x27;s time.—How  
important an affair then to Bri‘aiu is  
the preient treaty for fettling the bounds  
between her colonies and the Frezch,  
and how careful ihould the be to fe-  
cure room enough, iince on the room  
depends fo muca the encreale of let  
peopic?  
  
23. A nation well regulated is like a  
polypus; cut it in two, and each dén-  
cient part fhall {peedity grow out of the  
part remaining. ‘Thus it you have  
room and fubiultence enough, as you  
may by dividing, make ten polypuiles  
out of ene, you may of one make ten  
nations, equaily pcpulous and powerful.  
  
And fice detachments or Lugliyh  
from Briiam ient to America, will have  
their places at ome fo foon fupplied,  
and increafe fo. largely here; why  
fhould the Palatine boers be futlered ww

herding together eftablifh their-Taa-

Obfervations concerning the Increafe of  
Mankind, peopling of Countries, &amp;c.  
By B. Franklin, £/7; of Philadelphia.  
  
ABLES of the proportion of  
marriages to births, of deaths  
to births, and of marriages to the  
numbers of inhabitants, formed on  
obfervations made upon the bills of  
mortality and chriftenings, of populous  
cities, wi&#x27;l not fu:t countries ; nor will  
tables formed on obfervations made on  
full fettled old countries, as Europe,  
fuit new countries, as America.  
  
2. For people increafe in proportion  
to the number of marriages, and that  
is greater in proportion to the eafe  
and convenience of {upporting a fami-  
ly. When families can be*eafily fup-  
ported, more perfons marry, and ear-  
lier in life.  
  
3. In cities, where all trades, occu-  
Pations and offices are full, many de-  
lay marrying, till they can fee how to  
bear the charges of a family; which  
charges are greater in cities, as luxury

is More common: Many live fingle  
during life, and continue fervants,  
hence cities do not by natural gene-  
ration fupply themfelves with inhabi-  
tants; the deaths are more than the  
births.  
  
4. In countries full fettled, the cafe  
muit be nearly the fame; all lands be-  
ing Occupied and improved to the  
heigh&#x27;h, thofe who cannot get land,  
muit labour for others; when labour-  
ers are plenty, their wages will be low;  
by low wages a family is fupported with  
difficulty; this difficulty deters many  
from marriage.—Only as the cities  
take fupplies of people from the coun-  
try, and thereby make a little more  
room in the country, marriage is a  
little more encouraged there, and the  
births exceed the deaths.  
  
5. Lurope is generally fully fettled  
with hufbandmen and manufacturers,  
and therefore cannot now much in-  
creafe in people. America is chiefly  
occupied by /udians, who fubfift moftly  
by hunting. Butas the hunter, of all  
men, requires the greateft quantity of  
land for his fubfiftence, the Europeans  
found America as fully fettled as it well  
could be by hunters; yet thefe having  
large tracks, were eafily prevailed on to  
part with fome to the new comers

7. Hence marriages in America are  
more general, and more generally ear-  
ly, than in Europe. And if it is reck-  
oned there, that there is but one mare  
riage per Ann. among 100 perfons, per-  
haps we may reckon two; and if in  
Europe they have but four births to a  
marriage, (imany of their marriages  
being late) we may here reckon eight,  
of which one half grow up, and if our  
marriages are made, reckoning one  
with another at 20 years of age, our  
people muft at leaft be doubled every  
20 years. i&gt;

rica, that it will require many ages to  
fetile it fully; and till itis fully fettled  
Jabour will never be cheap, where no  
man continues long a labourer for o-  
thers; and thus labour is no cheaper  
now, in Penfylvania, than it was 30  
years ago.  
  
9g. The danger therefore of thefe co-  
lonies interfering with their mother  
country in trades that depend on la-  
bour and manufactures, is too remote  
to require the attention of Great-  
Britain.  
  
10. But in proportion to the increafe  
of the colonies, a vaft demand is grow-  
ing for Priti/&gt; manufactures, a glorious  
market wholly in the power of Britain,  
in which foreigners cannot interfere,  
  
‘which will increafe in fhort time even  
beyond her power of fupplying, though  
her whole trade fhould be to her co-  
lonies : Therefore Britain fhouid not  
too much reftrain manufaétures in her  
colonies.  
  
11. Befides if the manufactures of  
Britain thould, by the Ayerican de-  
mands, rife too high in price, foreign-  
ers who can fell cheaper will drive her  
merchants out of foreign markets; fo-  
reign manufactures will be encouraged  
and increafed, and foreign nations  
grow more populous and powerful;  
white her own colonies, kept too low,  
are unable to add to her ftrength.  
  
12. &quot;Tis an ill-grounded opinion  
that by the labour of flaves, 4inerica  
may poflibly vie in cheapnefs of manu-  
facttures with Britain. The labour of  
flaves can never be fo cheap here as  
the labour of working men ts in Bri-  
tain. Intereft of money is in the co-  
Jonies from 6 to 10 per Cent. Slaves  
one with another colt 30/. {terling per  
head. Reckon then the intereft of the  
firft purchafe of a flave, the infurance  
or rifque on his life, his cloathing ond  
diet, expences in his ficknefs and Jofs  
of time, lofs by his neglec&amp;t of bufinefs,  
expence of a driver to keep bim at  
work, and lofs by his pilfcring, and  
compare the whole amount with the  
wages of a manvficturer of iron or  
wool in Exglazd, you will fee that la-

bour is much cheaper there than it  
ever can be by Negroes here. Why  
then will Zmericans purchafe. flayes ?  
Becaufe flaves may be kept as long zs  
aman pleafes, while hired men are  
continually leaving their matters to fet  
up for themfelves. § 8,  
  
13. As the increafe of people de.  
pends on the encouragement of mar-  
riages, the following things mutt di-  
minifh a nation, vz. 1. The being  
conquered ; for the conquerors will  
engro{s as many offices, and exact as  
much tribute or profit on the labour  
of the conquered, as will maintain  
them in their new eftablifhment, and  
this diminifhing the fubfiftence of the  
natives difcourages their marriages,  
and fo gradually diminifhes them, while  
the foreigners increafe. 2. Lofs of  
territory. Thus the 8ritons being  
driven into Wales, and crowded toge-  
ther in a barren country infufficient to  
fupport fuch great numbers, diminithed  
till the people bore a proportion to the  
produce, while the Saxons increafed on  
their abandoned Jands, till the ifland  
became full of Exglifh. 3. Lols of  
trade. Manufaures exported, draw  
fubfiltence from foreign countries for  
numbers, who are thereby cnabled to  
marry and raife families. If the na-  
tion be deprived of any branch of  
trade, and no new employment is found  
for the peopie occupied in that branch,  
it will alfo be foon deprived of fo many  
people. 4. Lots of food. Suppote a  
nation has a fithery, which not only  
employs great numbers, but makes tne  
food and fubfiflence of the pour chesp-  
er: If another nation becomes mater  
of the feas, and prevents the fiery,  
the peoole will diminifh in proportion  
as the lofs of employ, and dezrncis of  
provilion, makes it more dificult to  
fubfift a family. 5. Bad government  
and infecure prope:ty. People not  
only leave fuch a country, and fetcing  
abroad incorporate with other nations,  
lofe their native language, and become  
foreigners; but the induftry of «h fe  
that remain being difcourared, 1°

ts Jeflen’d, and the fupport of a family  
becomes more diflicult. So heavy taxes  
tread to di soinith a people. 6. The  
introduction of flaves. The Negroes  
brought into the 4 suglifp fagar illands,  
have greatly dim nithed the whites  
there; the poor are by this means de-  
prived of emp! loyment, while a few  
families acquire vait eftates. The  
whites who have flaves, not labouring,  
are enfeebled, and therefore not fo  
prolific; the ‘flaves being work’d too  
hard, and ill ted, their couftitutions  
are broken, und the deaths among  
them are more than the births ; fo that  
a continual fupply is needed from 4-  
frica. The northern colonies having  
few flaves increafe in whites.  
  
14. Hence the prince that acquires  
new territory, if he finds it vacant, or  
removes the natives to give his own  
people room ; the Jegiflator that makes  
effectua | laws for promoting trade, in-  
creafing employment, improving land  
by more or bette ; tillage ; providing  
more food by fi ifheries, {ecuring pro-  
perty, ©c. and the man that invents  
  
| new trades, arts or manufactures, or  
  
new improveme nts in hufbandry, may  
be properly called Fathers of their na-  
tion, as they are the caufe of the gene-  
ration of multitudes, by the encourage-  
ment they afford to marriage.  
  
15. Privileges granted to the marri-  
ed, may batten the filling of a country  
  
that has been thinned by war or pellic.  
  
Jence, but cannot increafe a people be-  
yond the means provided for their fub-  
filtence.  
  
16. Foreign luxuries and needlefs  
aprdaciuees imported and ufed in a  
nation, do, by the fame reafonin::, in-  
creafe ‘the people of the nation that  
furnithes them, and diminifh the peo-  
ple of the nation that ufes them.-—  
Laws therefore that prevent fuch im-  
Portations, and on the contrary pro-  
mote the exportation of manufactures  
to be confumed in foreign countrics,  
may de called generative daws, as by  
increafing fubiiftence they encourage  
Marriage.  
  
$7. Some Eurspean nations prudent-

ly refufe to confume the manufaétures  
of Cafi-lndia:—-They thould likewife  
forbid them to their colonies; for the  
gain to the merchant ts not to be com-  
par’d with the lols, by this means, of  
people to the nation.  
  
13. Home luxury in the great, in-  
creajes the pation’s manufacturers em-  
ploy’d by it, who are many, and only  
tends to diminith the families that in-  
dulge in it, who are few. The great-  
er the common fafhionable expence of  
any rank of people, the more cautious  
they are of marriage. Therefore lux-  
  
iry fhould never be fuflered to become  
common,  
  
19. Vhe great increafe of offspring  
in particular familics, is not always  
OWing to greater fecundity of noture,  
bu: fometimes to examples of indultry  
in the heads, and indultrious educa-  
tion; by which the children are ena-  
bled to provide better for themfeives,  
and their marrying early is encouraged  
from the profpeét of good fubfiftence.  
  
20. It there be a fect therefore, in  
our nation, that regards frugality and  
iadillies as relipious duties, and edu-  
cates their children therein, more than  
others commonly do ; {uch fect mult  
encreafe more than any other.  
  
21. The importation of foreigners  
into a country that has as many inha-  
bitants as the prefent employments and  
provifions will bear; will be in the  
end no encreafe of p cople ; unlefs th  
new comers have more indaftry anit  
frugality than the natives, and then  
they will provide more fubfiftence, and  
increafe in the country; but they will  
gradually eat the natives out.-— Nor  
is it neceffary to bring in forcigners to  
fill up any occafional vacancy in a  
country ; for fuch vacancy (if the laws  
  
are good, § 14, 16.) will foon be filled  
by natural generation. Who can now  
find the vacancy made in Saveden by  
the plague of heroifin 40 years ago ;  
in France by the expu lfion of the pro-  
teftants; in Lxgland by the fettlement  
of her colonies; or in Guiney by 100  
years exportation of flaves, ‘that has  
  
blacken’d half America ?  
  
22. There  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
632  
  
  
  
22. There is in fhort, no bound to  
the prolifick nature of plants or ani-  
mals, but what is made by their crowd-  
ing and interfering with each other’s  
  
means of {ubfiftence. Was the fice of  
  
the earth vacant of other plants, it  
might be gradually fowed and over-  
fpread with one kind only 5 as, for in-  
{ftanee, with fennel; and were it empty  
oi other inhabitants, it might in a few  
ages be replenifhed from one nation  
only; as, for inflance, with Eng/i/p-  
men. Thus there are fuppofed to be  
now upwards of one million &amp;xgli/h  
fouls in Nort}-America, (though it is  
thought fcarce eighty thoufand have  
been brought over fea) and yet,  
haps, there is not one the fewer in  
Britain, but rather many more, on ac-  
count of the employment the colonies  
afford to manufacturers at home.  
This million doubling, fuppofe but  
once in twenty-five years, will in ano-  
ther century be more than the people  
of England, and the greateft number  
of Engitldinen will be on this fide the  
water. We have been here but iittle  
more than one hundred years, end yet  
the force of our privateers in the late  
war was greater, both In men and  
guns, than that of the whole Britz/&gt;  
navy in queen E/ixadeth’s time.—How  
important an affair than to Britain is  
  
ar  
wa ™  
  
  
  
the prefenttreaty for fettling the bounds |  
  
between her colonies and the French,  
and how careful fhould he be to fe-  
cure room enough, fince on the room  
depends fo much the encreate of her  
people?  
  
23. A‘nation well regulated is like  
a polypus; cut it in two, and each de-  
ficient part fhall fpeedily grow out of  
the part remaining. Thus if you have

marry, and earlier in life.  
  
3. In cities, where all trades,  
occupations and offices are full,  
many delay marrying, till they can  
fee how to bear the charges of a fa-  
mily ; which charges are greater in  
cities, as luxury is more common:

therefore long continue ‘rvany

ties take fupplies of people fog

little more room in the county;  
marriage is a little more incowaf  
there, and the births exceed ¢

5- Europe is generally full feted  
with hufbandmen, manufadurn,  
&amp;c, and therefore cannot nov  
much increafe in people: Ammitd

vents the fifhery, the people will

22. There is in fhort, no bound  
to the prolific nature of plants or  
animals, but what is made by their  
crowding and interfering with each  
others means of fubfiftence. Was  
the face of the earth vacant of o-  
ther plants, it might be gradually  
fowed and overfpread with one kind  
only ; as, for inftance, with fen-  
nel ; and were it empty of other  
inhabitants, it might in a few ages  
be replenifh’d from one nation on-  
ly ; as, for inftance, with Engiib-  
men. Thus there are fuppos’d to  
be now upwards of one million Eng-  
life fowls in North-America, (tho  
’tis thought fcarce 80,000 have  
been brought over Sea) and yet  
perhaps there is not one the fewer  
in Britain, but rather many more,  
on account of the employment the  
colonies afford to manufacturers at  
home. This million doubling,  
{uppofe but once in 25 years, will  
in another century be more than  
the people of England, and the  
greatet number of Englifhmen will  
be on this fide the water. What  
an acceffion of power to the Brit;  
empire by fea as well as land!  
what increafe of trade and naviga-  
tion ! What numbers of fhips and  
feamen! We have been here but  
littie more than 100 years, and yet  
the forces of our privateers in the  
late War, united, was greater,  
both in men and guns, than that  
of the whole Britis navy in queen  
Elizabeth’s time. —— How impor-  
tant an affair then to Britain, is the  
present treaty for fettling the bounds  
between her colonies and the French,  
and how careful fhould fhe be to  
fecure room enough, fince on the  
room depends fo much the increafe

the country, marriage is a little more en-  
couraged there, and the births exceed the  
deaths.  
  
5. Grext part of Europe is full fettled  
with hufbindmen, manufacturers, &amp;c.  
and therefore cannot now much encreafe  
in people. America is chiefly occupied  
by Indians, who fubfift moftly by hunt-  
ing—But as the hunter, of al! men, re-  
quires the greateft quantity of land from  
whence to draw his fubfiftence, (the huf-  
bandman fubfifting on much lefs, the gar-  
dener on {till lefs, and the manufaéturer  
requiring leaft cf all) th: Europeans  
found America as fully fettied as it could  
be by hunters; yet thefe, having large  
tra&amp;ts, were eafily prevailed on to part  
with portions of territory to the new  
comers, who did not much interfere with  
the natives in hunting, and furnifhed them  
with many things they wanted.  
  
6. Land being thus plenty in America,  
and fo cheap as that a labouring man that  
underftands hufbandry, can, in a fhort  
time fave money énough to purchafe a  
piece of new land, fofficient for a planta-  
tion, whereqn he may fubfift a family ;  
fuch are not afraid to marry ;. for, if they  
even look far enough forward to confider  
how their children, when grown up, are  
to be ;provided for, they fee that more  
land is to be had at rates equally eafy, all  
circumftances confidered.  
  
’ 7. Heoce marriages in America are more  
general, and more generally early than in  
Europe. And if it is reckoned there, that  
there is butone marriage per ann, amongioo  
perfons, perhaps we may here reckon two;  
and if in Europe they have but four births  
toa marriage, (many of their marriages  
being late). we may here reckon eight ;  
of which, if one half grow up,.and our  
marriages are made, reckoning one with  
another, at twenty years of age, our peo-  
ple muft at leat be doubled every twenty  
years. ’  
8. But, notwithftanding this increafe,  
fo vaft is the territory of North-America,  
that it will require many ages to fettle it  
fully ; and till iris fully fettled, labour  
will never be cheap here, where no man  
continues Jong a Jabourer for others, but  
gets a plantation of his own; no man  
continues long a journeymantoa trade, but  
gore among thofe new (ettlers, and fets up  
or himieif, &amp;c. Hence Jabour is no  
cheaper now, in Pennfilvania, than, it.was  
thirty years ago, though fo many .thou-  
{ind labouring people have been, import-  
ed from Germany and Ireland. ,  
  
g. The danger, therefore, of thefe co-  
lonies interfering with their mother coun-  
  
try in trades that depend on Jabour, ma.  
  
nufaétures, &amp;-:. is too remote to require  
the attention of Great Britain,  
  
10. But, in proportion to the increafe  
of the colonies, a vaft demand is growing  
for Britifh manufaétures ; a glorious  
market, whu!ly in thepower of Britain, in  
which foreigners cannot interfere, which  
will increafe, in a fhort time, even be.  
yond her power of fupplying, though  
her whole trade fhould be to her colonies,  
* * * . ;  
  
12. &quot;Tis an ill grounded opinion, that  
by the labour of flives America may pof-  
fibly vie in cheapnefs of manufactures  
with Britain. The labour of flaves can  
never be fo cheap here, as the labour of  
working men is in Britain. Any one may  
compute it. Intereft cf money is in the  
colonies from 6 to 10 percent. Slaves,  
one with another, coft 30!. fterling per  
head. Reckon then the intereft of the  
firft purchafe of a flave, the infurance or  
rifque on his life, his cloathing and diet,  
expences in his ficknefs, and lofs of time,  
lofs by his negleé of bufinefs, (negleét is  
natural to the man who is not to be bene-  
fited by his own care and diligence) expence  
of a driver to keep him at work, and his  
pilfering from, time to time, almof every:  
flave being, fiom the nature of flavery, a  
thief; and compare the whole amount  
with the wages of a manufacturer of iron  
or wool in England, you will fee that la-  
bour is much cheaper there, than it ever  
can be by negroes here. Why then will  
Americans purchafe flaves ? Becaufe flaves  
may be kept as long 2s a man pleafes, or  
has occafion for their labour ; while hired  
men are continually leaving their mafter  
(often inthe midft of his bufinefs) and  
jetting up for themfelves. § 8.  
  
13. As the increafe of people depends  
on the encouragement of marriages, the  
following things muft diminifh a nation,  
viz. 1. The being conquered ; for the  
conquerors will engrofs as many offices,  
and exaé&amp; as much tribute or profit on the  
labour of the Conquered, as will maintain  
them in their new eftablifhorent ; and this  
diminifhing the fubfiftence of the natives  
difcourages their marriages, and fo gra-  
dually diminifhes them, while the fo-  
reigners increafe. 2, Lofs of territory.  
Thus the Britons being driven into Wales,  
and crouded together in a barren Country,  
infufficient to fupport fuch great numbers,  
diminifhed, till the people bore a propor-  
tion to the produce, while the Saxons in-

by fome foreign nation, there would, in a  
few years, be no move Englifhmen in  
Britain, than there are now peopie in  
Wales. 3 Lofs of trade. Manufaciures  
exported draw fubfiitence from foreign  
countries for numbers ; who are thereby  
enabled to marry and raife families. If  
the nation be deprived of any branch of  
trade, and no new employment is found  
for the people occupied in that branch,  
it will foon be deprived of fo many peo-  
ple. 4. Lofs of food. Suppofe a na-  
tion has a fithery, which not only em-  
ploys great numbers, but makes the food  
and fubfiftence of the people cheaper: If  
another nation becomes matter of the feas,  
and prevents the fifhery, the people will  
diminifh in proportion as the lofs of em-  
ploy, and dearnefs of provifion makes it  
more difficultto fubfiftafamily. 5. Bad  
government and infecure property. Peo-  
ple not only leave fuch a country, and  
fettling abroad incorporate with other na-  
tions, lofe their native language, and he-  
come foreigners ; but the induftry of thofe  
that remain being difcourage, the quan-  
tity of fubfiftence in the country is leffen-  
ed, and the fupport of a family becomes  
more difficult. So heavy taxes tend to  
diminifh a people. 6. Tne introdudtion  
of flives. “The negroes brought into the  
Englith fugar iflands have greatly dimi-  
nifhed the poor whites there ; they are by this  
picans deprived of employment, while a  
few families acquire vaft eftates, which  
they fpend on foreign luxuries, and edu-  
cating their children in the habit of thofe  
luxuries; the fame {Income is needed for  
the fupport of one, that might have  
maintained one hundred. ‘The whites,  
who have flaves not labouring, are en-  
fecbled, and therefore not fo generally pro-  
lific ; the flaves being worked too hard,  
and ill fed, their conftitutions are broken,  
and the deaths among them are more than  
the births; fothat a continual fupply is  
needed from*Afiica. The northern co-  
lonics, having few flaves, increafe in  
whites. Slaves alfo pejorate the families  
that ufe them ; the white children become  
proud, difgufted with labour, and, being  
educated iuidleaefs, are rendered unfit to  
geta living by induftry.  
  
14. Hence the Prince that acquires new  
territory, if he finds it vacant, or removes  
the natives to give his own people room 5  
the legiflator that makes eff-Gtual laws for  
Promoting of trade, increafing employ-  
ment, improving land by more or better  
tillage, providing more food by filheries,  
fecuring property, &amp;c. and the man that  
invents new trades, arts, or manufactures  
or new improvements in hufbandry, may  
  
397  
be properly called Fathers of their nation,  
as tney are the caufe of the generation of  
multituses, by the encouragement they  
afford to marriage.  
  
15. As to privileges granted to the  
mariied (fuch as the jus trum liberorum  
among the Romans) they may haften the  
fil:iag of a country that has been thinned  
by war or peltilence, or that has other  
wie vacant territory, but cannot increafe  
a people beyond the means provided for  
their fubGiltence.  
  
16. Foreign luxuries, and need!efs  
manufactures, imported and ufed in a  
nation, do, by the fame reafoning, increafe  
the people of the nation that furnifhes  
them, and diminifh the people of the  
nation that ufes them,—Laws, therefore,  
that prevent fuch :mportations, aod, on  
the contrary, promote the exportation of  
manofatures to be confumed in foreign  
countries, may be called (with refpeét to  
the people that make them) generative  
laws, as by increafing fadfiftence they en-  
courage marriage. Such laws likewife  
ftrengthen a country doubly, by increafing  
its own people, and diminifhing its neigh-  
bours.  
  
17. Some European nations prudently re-  
fufe to confume the manufaétures of Eait-  
India : They thould likéwi‘e for-  
bid them to their colonies ; for the gain  
to the merchant is not to be compared  
with the lofs, by this means, of people  
to the nation.  
  
18. Home luxury in the great increa-  
fes the nation’s manufatturers employed  
by it, who are many, and only tends to  
diminifh the families thatindulge in it,  
who are few. Tile greater the common  
fath:onable expence of any rank of people,  
the more cautious they are of marriage.  
Therefore luxury fhould never be fuf-  
fered 10 become common.  
  
19. The great increafe of offspring in  
parucular families is not always owing  
to greater fecundity of nature, but fome-  
times to examples of induftry in the  
heads, and induftrious education; by  
which the children are enabled to provide  
better for themfelves, and their marrylog  
early is encouraged from the profpe&amp; ot  
good fubfiftence.  
  
zo. If there be a fe&amp;, therefore, in  
our nation, that regard frugality ard in-  
duftry as religious duties, and educate  
their children therein, more than others  
commotly&#x27; do; fuch fect mut confe-

fiftence wil! bear, will be in the end no in-  
ereafe of people, unlefs thenew-comers have  
more induftryand frugality than the natives,  
and then they will provide more fubfif-  
tence, and increafe in the country ; but  
they will gradually eat the natives out. —  
Nor is it neceflary to bring in foreigners  
to fill up any occafional vacancy in a  
country ; for fuch vacancy (if the laws  
are good, §14, 16) will foon be filled  
by natural generation. Who can now  
find the vacancy made in Sweden, France,  
or other warlike nations, by the plague  
of heroifm 4o years ago; in France, by  
the expulfion of the Proteftants ; in  
England, by the fettlement of her colo-  
mies; or in Guinea, by a hundred years  
exportation of flaves, that has black-  
ened half America ?—The thinnefs of the  
inhabitants in Spain, is owing to nations]  
pride, and idlenefs, and other caufes,  
rather than to the expulfion of the Moors,  
orto the making of new fettlements.  
  
22. There is, in fhort, no bound to  
the prolific nature of plants or animals,  
but what is made by their crouding and  
interfering with each other&#x27;s means of  
fubfiftence. Was the face of the earth  
vacant of other plants, it might be gradu-  
ally fowed and overipread with one kind  
only ; a8, for inftance, with fennel ; and,  
were ‘it empty of other inhabitants, it  
might, in’a few ages, be replenifhed trom  
one’ nation only, as, for inftance, with  
Englifhmen.&#x27; ‘Thus there are fuppofed to  
be now upwards of one million Englith  
fouls in North America, (though it is  
  
thought fearce eighty thoufand hate been  
brought over fea) and yet perhaps there is  
not one fewer in Britain, but rather  
many more,fon account of the employment  
the colonies afford to manufactures at home,  
This million doubling, fuppofe but once  
in 25 years, will, in another century, be  
more than the people of England, and the  
greateft number of Englishmen will be on  
this fide the water. What an acceffion  
of power to the Britifh empire by fea as  
well as land! What increaie of trade and  
navigation |! What numbers of fhips and  
feamen! We have been here but litle  
more than a hundred years, and yet the  
force of our privateers in the late war,  
united, was greater, both in men and  
guns, than that of the whole Britifh navy  
in Queen Elifabeth’s time. ———How im.  
portant an affair, then, to Britain, is the  
prefent treaty + for fettling the bounds  
between her colonies and the French!  
and how careful fhould the be to fecure  
room enough, fince on the room depends  
fo much the increafe of her people ?  
  
23. In fine. a nation well regulated is  
like a polypus }; take away a limb, its  
piace is foon fupplied ; cut it in two, ard  
each deficient part fhall fpeedily grow out  
of the part remainiog. Thus if you have  
room and fubfiftence enough, as you may,  
by dividing, make ten polypufes out of  
one, you may, of one, mske ten nations,  
equally populous and powerful ; or, ra-  
ther, tncreafe a nation ten fold in num.  
bers and flrength, * *

pears to me on the flighteft infpe€tion fo  
extremely clear, as icarcely to need any de-  
tail of argument to prove it. However, as  
our author has thought preper to dwell very  
largely on the errors of my pamphlet, though  
in themfelves equally manifeit with the mif-  
apprehenfions now alluded to, I thall cer-  
tainly ftand excuted if, in the difcuffion of  
this matter, I defcend to greater minutenefs  
than would be otherwife neceflary.  
  
We will begin with the poor animal to

any branch of trade, and no new em-

cupied in that branch, it will foon be

of food. Suppofe a nation has a  
fifhery, which not only employs great  
numbers, but makes the food and fub-  
f:flence of the people cheaper : if ano-  
ther nation becomes matter of the  
feas, and prevents the fithery, the  
people will diminith in proportion as  
the Joots of employ, and dearnefs of  
provifion. make it more difficult to  
fubfiit a family. 5. Bad government  
and infecure property. People not  
only leave fuch a country, and, tet-  
thing abroad, incorporate with other  
naitons, lofe their native languace,  
and become foreigners ; but the indut-  
try of thofe that remain, being dit-  
couraged, the quantity of fubfiltence  
in the country ts leffened, and the fup-  
port of afamily becomes more difh-  
cult. So heavy taxes tend todiminifha  
eople. 6. The introduction of flaves.  
The negroes brought into the Englith  
fugar-iflands, have greatly dimnifhed  
the whites there; the poor are by this  
means deprived of employment, while

and, educating their children in the  
habu of thofe foxuries, che fame in-  
come is needed for the fupport of one,  
that might have maintained one hun-  
decd. The whites, who have flaves

tierefore not fo generally prolific ;  
the fluves being worked too hard, and  
ist fed, cheir conftitutions are broken,

than the births; fo that a continual

ing property, &amp;c.—and the man that  
invents new trades, arts, or manufac

bandry ; may be properly called the fa-  
thers of their nations, as they are the  
caufe of the generation of multitudes,  
by the encouragement they afford to  
marriage. :

rum among the Romans) they may  
hatten the filling of a country that has  
been thinned by war or peftilence, or  
that has otherwile vacant territory ;  
but cannot increafe a people beyond  
the means provided for their fubfitt-  
ence,  
  
16. Foreign luxuries and needlefs  
manufatiures, imported and ufed in a  
naion, do, by the fame reafoning, in-  
creafe the people of the nation that  
furnifhes them, and diminifh the peo-  
ple ofthe nation that ufesthem. Laws,  
therefore, that prevent fuch importa-  
tions, and, onthe contrary, promote  
the exportaiion of manufactures to be  
confimed in foreign countries, may  
be called (with ref{pect to the people  
that make them) generative laws,  
as, by increafing fubfiltence, they  
encourage marriage. Such laws likes

tures of Ealt India:—Jhey fthould  
likewrfe forbid them to their colonies ;  
for the gain to the merchant is not te  
be compared with the lofs, by th:s  
means, of people to the nation,  
  
18. Home luxury in the great, in-  
creafes the nation’s manufacturers em-  
ployed by it, who are many, and one  
ly tends to diminith the families that  
indulge in it, who are few, The  
greater the common fafhionable ex-  
penfe of any rank of people, the more  
cautious they are of marriage. There-  
fore luxury fhould never be fuflered  
to become common,  
  
19. Lhe great increafe of offspring in  
parucular fam:bes, 1s not always ew-  
ing to greater fecundity of nature, bit  
fometimes to examples of indultry  
in the heads, and induftrious educa-  
tion; by which the children are en-  
abied to provide better for themfelves,  
and their marrying carly is encouraged  
from the profpect of good fubfittence.  
  
eo. It there be a fect, therefore,  
in ous nation, that regard frugal :v  
and induftry as religious duties, and  
educate their children therein, more  
than others communiy do; fach feck  
mult confequently increaie more by na-  
tural generation, than any other fect in  
Britain,  
  
21. The importation of foreigners  
into a country that has as many inhabi-  
tants as the prefent employments and  
provifions fe: fubfillence, will bear,  
will be in the end no increafe of peo-  
ple ; unlefs the new-comers have  
inore induflry and frugality than the  
natives, and then they will provide  
more fubfiltence, and increafe in the  
country ; but they will gradually eai  
the natives out. Noris it neceflary  
tobring in foreigners to fill up any  
occafional vacancy, in a ¢onntry ; tor  
fuch vacancy (if the laws are good),  
will foon be filled by natural genera-  
tion. Who can now find the vacan-  
cy made in Sweden, France, or other  
warlike nations, by the plague of he-  
roifm forty years ago ; in France by  
the expulfion of the proteflants; in

can be easily supported, more per-  
sons marry, and earlier in life.  
  
“Jn cities, where all trades, oc-  
cupations, and offices are full, many  
delay until they can see how to bear  
the charges of a family; which  
charges are greater in cities, as  
luxury is mere common; many live  
single during life, and continue ser-  
vants to families, journeymen to  
trades, &amp;c. hence cities do not, by  
natural generation, supply them-  
selves with inhabitants; the deaths  
are more than the births.  
  
“ In countries full settled, the case  
must be nearly the same; all lands  
being occupied and improved to the  
height, those who cannot get land  
  
‘must labour for those who have it ;  
  
when labourers are plenty, their  
wages will be low ; by low wages, a  
family is supported with difficulty ;  
this difficuity deters many from  
marriage, who therefore long con-  
tinue servants, and single. Only as  
cities take supplies of people from  
the country, and thereby make a  
little more room in the country,  
marriage is a little more encourag-  
ed there, and the births exceed the  
deaths.  
  
“ Great part of Europe is full set-  
tled with husbandmen, manufactur-  
ers, &amp;c. and therefore cannot now  
much increase in people. Land be-  
ing plenty in America, and so cheap,  
as that a labouring man, who under-  
stands husbandry, can in a short  
time save money enough to pur-  
chase a piece of new land sufficient  
for a plantation, whereon he may  
subsist a family, such are not afraid  
to marry; for even if they look far  
enough forward to consider how  
their children, when grown, are to  
be provided for, they see that more  
land is to be had at rates equally  
easy, all circumstances considered.  
  
*“ Hence marriages in America  
are more general, and more gene-  
rally early than in Europe. And if  
it is reckoned there, that there is  
but one marriage fer annum among  
100 persons, perhaps we may here  
reckon two; and if in Europe they  
have but four births to a marriage  
  
  
  
(many of their marriages being late)  
we may here reckon eight ;. of  
which, if one half grow up, and our  
marriages are made, reckoning one  
with another, at twenty years of age,  
our fieofile must be doubled at least  
every twenty years.  
  
“ But notwithstanding this in-  
crease, so vast is the territory of  
North America, that it will require  
many ages to settle it fully ; and,  
until it is fully settled, labour will  
never be cheap here, where no man  
continues long a labourer for others,  
but gets a plantation of his own;  
no man continues long a journeyman  
to a trade, but goes among those  
new settlers, and sets up for him-  
self, &amp;c. Hence labour is no cheaper  
now (1755) in Pennsylvania, than  
it was thirty years ago, though so  
many thousand labouring people have  
been imported from Germany and  
Ireland.  
  
“ In proportion to the increase of |  
  
the colonies, a vast demand is grow-  
ing for British manufactures, a glo-  
rious market wholly in the power  
of Britain, in which foreigners can-  
not interfere, which will increase in  
a short time even beyond her power  
of supplying, though her whole trade  
should be to her colonies.”

ideas on American population, an

Great Britain. But in proportion to the increase of the colonies,  
a vast demand is growing for British manufactures ; a glorious mar-

the population of any country could ever, in any circum-  
stances, be increased two or three-fold beyond its means of  
subsistence ?  
  
‘ There is no bound to the prolific nature of plants or animals,  
but what is made by their crowding and interfering with each other&#x27;s  
means of subsistence. Was the face of the earth vacant of other  
plants, it might be gradually sowed and overspread with one kind  
only, as for instance with fennel; and were it empty of other in-  
habitants, it might, in a few ages, be replenished from one nation  
only, as for instance with Englishmen. Thus there are supposed  
to be now (1751) upwards of one million of English souls in North  
America, though it is thought scarce 80,000 have been brought  
over sea, and yet perhaps there is not one the fewer in Britain,  
but rather many more, on account of the employment the colo-  
nies afford to manufacturers at home, This million, doubling sup-  
pose but once in twenty-five years, will, in another century, be  
more than the people of England, and the greatest number of  
Englishmen will be on this side of the water.’ — ‘ In fine, a nation  
well-regulated is like a polypus; take away a limb, its place is  
soon supplied : cut it in two, and each deficient part shall speedily  
grow out of the part remaining. Thus, if you have room and  
subsistence enough, as you may by dividing make ten polypuses

paper. After showing that in America “our people must  
at least be doubled every twenty years,” he insists that  
“notwithstanding this increase, so vast is the territory of  
North America that it will require many ages to settle it  
fully ; and till it is fully settled, labor will never be cheap here,  
where no man continues long a laborer for others, but gets  
a plantation of his own; no man continues a journeyman to  
a trade, but goes among those new settlers and sets up for  
himself. Hence labor is no cheaper now in Pennsylvania  
than it was thirty years ago, though so many thousand labor-  
ing people have been imported.” On account of this dear-  
ness of labor, he argues that England need not fear Ameri-  
can competition in manufactures in foreign markets. There-  
fore, he says, “ Britain should not too much restrain manu-  
factures in her colonies. A wise and good mother will not  
do it. To distress is to weaken, and weakening the children  
weakens the whole family.” He says elsewhere: “

tures under such circumstances. After society has reached  
the manufacturing stage there will be a rapid increase in  
population, until population again presses upon subsistence.  
When this stage is reached the population must necessarily  
remain stationary. “Europe is generally full settled with  
husbandmen and manufacturers, and therefore cannot now  
much increase in people.”
