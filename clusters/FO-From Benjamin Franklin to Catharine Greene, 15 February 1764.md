[Extract.]—I condole with you on the death of  
the good old lady your mother ; separations of this  
kind from those we love are grievous, but ’t is the  
will of God that such should be the nature of things  
in this world; all that ever were born are either  
dead, or must die. It becomes us to submit, and  
comfort ourselves with the hope of a better life,  
and more happy meeting hereafter. * * My  
dame sends her love to you, and thanks for the  
care you took of her old man ; but having bad specs,  
cannot write at present. B. F.
