Humanity, with all its fears,<br/>
With all the hopes of future years,<br/>
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!<br/>
We know what master laid thy keel,<br/>
What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,<br/>
Who made each mast, each sail, each rope,<br/>
What anvils sang, what hammers beat,<br/>
In what a forge and what a heat,<br/>
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!<br/>
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,<br/>
&#x27;Tis of the wave and not the rock;<br/>
&#x27;Tis but the flapping of the sail,<br/>
And not a rent made by the gale!<br/>
In spite of rock and tempest&#x27;s roar,<br/>
In spite of false lights on the shore,<br/>
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!<br/>
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee:<br/>
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, tears,<br/>
Are all with thee—are all with thee</td></tr></table></div><hr />
