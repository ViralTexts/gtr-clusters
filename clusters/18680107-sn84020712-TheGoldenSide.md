There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If only we would stop to take it;  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would make it!  
To the sunny soul, that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne&#x27;er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
  
Better to hope though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eye still lifted;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,  
When the ominous clouds are rifted!  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown,  
Or the miser&#x27;s hoarded treasure;  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother&#x27;s prayers to Heaven,  
Or a beggar&#x27;s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling  
And to do God&#x27;s will with a ready heart,  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate minute, threads  
Of our curious lives asunder;  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit and grieve and wonder.

From the south western Presbyteriane  
THE GOLDEN SIDE.  
There is many a rest on the road of life,  
If we only would stop to take it;  
And many a tone from the better land,  
  
If the querulous heart would make it.  
To the sunny soul that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne&#x27;erfieth,  
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
Better to hope, though clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eye still lifted  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through  
When the ominous clouds are ritted!  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning;  
And the dorrest heur--as the proverb goes  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
There &#x27;s many a gem in the path of life  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweted crown,  
Or the miser&#x27;s hoarded treasure  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother&#x27;s prayers to heaven,  
Or only a beggar&#x27;s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
Better to weave, in the web of life,  
aA brigt and golden fiiling  ea  
to do God&#x27;s wilt with a ready heart,  
And nands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate, minute threads  
of our curious lif, asunder,  
And then blame heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit, and grieve, and wonder.

Or only a beggar’s thanks,  
For a oup of water given.  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling,  
And to God’s will bow with ready heart  
And bands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate, innate thread  
Of our curious lives asunder,  
Thpn blame Heaven for the tangled ends,
