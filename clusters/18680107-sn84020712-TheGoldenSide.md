There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If only we would stop to take it;  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would make it!  
To the sunny soul, that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne&#x27;er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
  
Better to hope though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eye still lifted;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,  
When the ominous clouds are rifted!  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown,  
Or the miser&#x27;s hoarded treasure;  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother&#x27;s prayers to Heaven,  
Or a beggar&#x27;s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling  
And to do God&#x27;s will with a ready heart,  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate minute, threads  
Of our curious lives asunder;  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit and grieve and wonder.

Poetry.  
The Golden Side.  
There is many a rest in the road of life  
If we would bnt stop to take it;  
And many a tone from the hotter land,  
If the querulous heart would make it.  
To the sunny soul that is full of hope.  
And whose beautiful trust ne’er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,  
Though the winter storm prevaileth.  
Better to hope, though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the oye still lifted,  
For the sweet blue sky will still peep through  
When the ominous clouds are rifted.  
There ne’er was a night without a day,  
Or an eve without a morning,  
And the darkest hour—so the proverb goes—  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown  
Or the Miser’s hoarded treasure;  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother’s prayer to Heaven,  
Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
Better to weave the web of life  
A bright and golden filling, c  
And do God’s work with a ready heart;  
And hands that are prompt and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate minute threads ,  
Of our curious lives asunder,  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit and grieve and wonder

pn. In 1869 a number of troops were  
sent to the different railroads for in­  
struction, with a view to the ulterior  
formation of companies capable of  
building, destroying, or managing rail­  
roads in time of war. During the com­  
ing evolutions these men will lay down  
rails to connect the Peterhoff and War­  
saw line. The distance is a little over  
live miles, and the work must be com­  
pleted in ten days, so that the line can  
be made use of for the transportation of  
troops during the last four or five days  
of the maneuvres.

A Costly Mistake.—A rather costly  
mistake is stated to have been made in the office of a  
member of the Liverpool Stock Exchange recently.  
Tne principal, perceiving on the desk wnat ha sup­  
nosed to boa quantity oi waste paper, hastily gath­  
ered it up and threw it into the fire, where it was  
speedily burned. A.most *mmed.ately afterward he  
found that with the paper he had thrown into the  
flames Bank of England notes of the value of $1,400.  
The numbers of the notes are not known.  
  
&#x27; THE GOLDEN SIDE.  
BY MRS. M. A. KIDDER.  
There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If wo only wou d stop to take it;  
And many a tone from the better land.  
If the querulous heart would teke it  
To the sunny soul that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust near faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,  
Though the Wintry storm provaileth.  
Better to hope, though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eyes still lifted;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,  
When the ominous clouds are rifted.  
There was never a night without a day.  
Nor an evening without a morning;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
There is many a gem in the path of life.  
Which we iu our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled orown,  
Or tho miser’s hoarded treasure;  
It may be the love of a little child.  
Or a mother’s prayer to heaven.  
Or only a beggar’s grateful thaaks  
For a cup of water given.  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling.  
And to do God’s will with a ready heart  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate, minute threads  
Of our curious lives assunders ;  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends.  
And sit and grieve an-d wonder.

we ac-  
cept the gift, but forget the Giver! Not of  
such, however, was the Royal Psalmist, as  
manifested in the beautiful language contained  
in the 107th Psalm:  
  
“Oh! that men would praise the Lord for  
his goodness and for his wonderful works to the  
  
children of men!”  
  
Our late dear friend, Ebenezer Worth, once  
remarked, “ that it was a great favor to be sensi-  
ble of our blessings.”  
  
The spirit of trust and hopefulness expressed  
in the following lines, have sometimes been  
cheering, and hoping they may be so to others,  
are offered for insertion in THe FRIEND—av-  
thor unknown:  
  
THE BRIGHT SIDE.  
  
There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If we only would stop to take it,  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would wake it!  
To the sunny soul that is full of hope  
And whose beautiful trust ne’er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,  
Tho’ the wintry storm prevaileth.  
  
Better to hope, tho’ the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eyes still lifted ;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,  
When the ominous clouds are rifted !  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning ;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
  
There is many a gem in the path of life  
Which we pass in an idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown,  
Or the miser’s hoarded treasure ;  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother’s prayers to heaven,  
Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling,  
And to do God’s will with a ready heart  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate slender thread  
Of our curious lives asunder,  
And then blame heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit, and grieve, and wonder.

There’s many a rest on the road of life,  
If we could only stop to iak it;  
Ard many a ton. from the better land.  
If thi querulous heart would wake it.  
To the sunny soil that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne&#x27;er faileth,  
Th* grass is green and flowers are bright.  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
Better to hooe, though the clouds hang  
low.  
And to keep the eyes still lifted.  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep  
through.  
When the ominous clouds are rifted.  
There was never a night without a day,  
Nor an evening without a morning;  
And the darkest hour, the proverb goes.  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
\\ hlch we pass in idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than a jeweled crown,  
Or the miser&#x27;s hoarded treasure.  
It may be the love of a little child.  
Or a mother&#x27;s prayer to heaven.  
Or only a beggar&#x27;s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling.  
And do God&#x27;s will with a ready heart,  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate silver thread

Shall be all absorbed again,  
Melting, flowing into one.  
C. P. Cranch,  
  
  
  
GOOD MEMORY WORK: V/1.  
  
PSALM C.  
  
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all  
ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness:  
come before his presence with singing.  
Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is  
he that hath made us, and not we our-  
selves; we are his people, and the sheep  
of his pasture. Enter into his gates with  
thanksgiving, and into his courts with  
praise: be thankful unto him, and bless  
his name. For the Lord is good; his  
mercy is everlasting: and his truth en-  
dureth to all generations. April zoth.  
  
THE BRIGHT SIDE.  
  
There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If we only would stop to take it,  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would wake it !  
To the sunny soul that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne’er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
  
Better to hope, though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eyes still lifted ;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep thro’  
When the ominous clouds are rifted !  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning ;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown  
Or the miser’s hoarded treasure ;  
  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother’s prayers to Heaven ;  
  
Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks,  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling,  
  
And to do God’s will with a ready heart,  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
  
Than to snap the delicate, slender threads  
Of our curious lives asunder,  
  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit, and grieve, and wonder.
