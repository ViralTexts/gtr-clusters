There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If only we would stop to take it;  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would make it!  
To the sunny soul, that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne&#x27;er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
  
Better to hope though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eye still lifted;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,  
When the ominous clouds are rifted!  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown,  
Or the miser&#x27;s hoarded treasure;  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother&#x27;s prayers to Heaven,  
Or a beggar&#x27;s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling  
And to do God&#x27;s will with a ready heart,  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate minute, threads  
Of our curious lives asunder;  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit and grieve and wonder.
