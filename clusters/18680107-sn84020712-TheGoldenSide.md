There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If only we would stop to take it;  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would make it!  
To the sunny soul, that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne&#x27;er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
  
Better to hope though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eye still lifted;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,  
When the ominous clouds are rifted!  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown,  
Or the miser&#x27;s hoarded treasure;  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother&#x27;s prayers to Heaven,  
Or a beggar&#x27;s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling  
And to do God&#x27;s will with a ready heart,  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
Than to snap the delicate minute, threads  
Of our curious lives asunder;  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit and grieve and wonder.

Marseilles struck for higher wages, and sent  
their emissaries to La Ciotat in order to ob-

failed. 3. Those apprentices who have been

and age, but in a higher moral tone and con-

pn. In 1869 a number of troops were  
sent to the different railroads for in­  
struction, with a view to the ulterior  
formation of companies capable of  
building, destroying, or managing rail­  
roads in time of war. During the com­  
ing evolutions these men will lay down  
rails to connect the Peterhoff and War­  
saw line. The distance is a little over  
live miles, and the work must be com­  
pleted in ten days, so that the line can  
be made use of for the transportation of  
troops during the last four or five days  
of the maneuvres.

There’s many a rest on the road of life,  
If we could only stop to take It;  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would make it.  
To the sunny soul that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne’er failcth,  
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
Better to hope, though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eye still lifted;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,  
When the ominous clouds are lifted.  
There was never a night without a day,  
Nor an evening without a morning.  
And the darkest hour, the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
There is many a gem in the path of life.  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure.  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown,  
Or the miser’s hoarded treasure;  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother’s prayer to heaven,  
Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks  
For a cup of water given.

Shall be all absorbed again,  
Melting, flowing into one.  
C. P. Cranch,  
  
  
  
GOOD MEMORY WORK: V/1.  
  
PSALM C.  
  
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all  
ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness:  
come before his presence with singing.  
Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is  
he that hath made us, and not we our-  
selves; we are his people, and the sheep  
of his pasture. Enter into his gates with  
thanksgiving, and into his courts with  
praise: be thankful unto him, and bless  
his name. For the Lord is good; his  
mercy is everlasting: and his truth en-  
dureth to all generations. April zoth.  
  
THE BRIGHT SIDE.  
  
There is many a rest in the road of life,  
If we only would stop to take it,  
And many a tone from the better land,  
If the querulous heart would wake it !  
To the sunny soul that is full of hope,  
And whose beautiful trust ne’er faileth,  
The grass is green and the flowers are bright,  
Though the wintry storm prevaileth.  
  
Better to hope, though the clouds hang low,  
And to keep the eyes still lifted ;  
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep thro’  
When the ominous clouds are rifted !  
There was never a night without a day,  
Or an evening without a morning ;  
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,  
Is the hour before the dawning.  
  
There is many a gem in the path of life,  
Which we pass in our idle pleasure,  
That is richer far than the jeweled crown  
Or the miser’s hoarded treasure ;  
  
It may be the love of a little child,  
Or a mother’s prayers to Heaven ;  
  
Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks,  
For a cup of water given.  
  
Better to weave in the web of life  
A bright and golden filling,  
  
And to do God’s will with a ready heart,  
And hands that are swift and willing,  
  
Than to snap the delicate, slender threads  
Of our curious lives asunder,  
  
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,  
And sit, and grieve, and wonder.
