SEVENTY THOUSAND letters, filling one hundred and fifty sacks, and weighing nearly eleven hundred pounds, were recently mailed from the city of New York to various foreign lands within the space of two days. This statement will give some idea of the immensity of the postal business in that city. It is also estimated that between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and fifty tones of mail matter are, on the average, handled every day by the eight hundred post-office employees; and that not less than 300,000 letters, and often a much larger number of newspapers, are sorted out by them during twenty-four hours. From two to five hundred unstamped, misdirected, unaddressed or unsealed letters and packages daily accumulate in the New York Post Office.

In a recent lecture upon “The Rights and  
Wrongs of Children,’? Mrs. George Vandenhoff  
claimed the right of a child to a good physical  
training, a good happy home, and kind, court-  
eous, truthful treatment in that home. While  
she did not believe children could always be  
governed without punishment, she denounced  
whipping; and looked for the time when some  
of the savans engaged in new translations of  
the Scriptures would find out that Solomon, so  
often quoted in favor of the ‘‘ rod,’’ would prove  
to = meant ‘Spare the rod, and save the  
child.  
  
  
  
Just now, when colds and influenzas are pre-  
vailing, it is well to remember that after any ex-  
ercise that quickens the circulation a draught of  
air upon the person is almost sure to cause a  
chill and produce a cold. Outside garments  
should never be hastily removed when one is  
heated or in a perspiration.
