The Congress sensible of your Merit towards the United States, but unable adequately to reward it, determined to present you with a Sword, as a small Mark of their grateful Acknowledgement.— They directed it to be ornamented with suitable Devices.

Passy, 24th Aveusr, 1799.  
  
Sin, The Congress sensible of your merit  
towards the United States, but unable adequate-  
ly to reward it, determined to present you with  
a sword, as a small mark of grateful acknowl-  
edgment. ‘They directed it to be ornamented  
with suitable devices. Some of the principal  
actions of the war, in which you distinguished  
yourself by your bravery and conduct, are  
therefore, represented upon it. These with a  
few emblematic figures, all admirably well ex-  
ecuted, make its principal value. By the help  
of the exquisite artists France affords, I find it  
easy to express every thing, but the sense we  
have of your worth and our obligations to you.  
For this, figures, and even words, are found  
insufficient.  
  
I therefore only add, that, with the most per-  
fect esteem and respect, 1 have the honor of  
presenting it to you. B. FRANKLIN.  
  
P.S.—My grandson goes to Havre with the  
sword, and will have the honor of presenting  
it to you.
