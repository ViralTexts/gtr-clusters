Damp Winds tho’ not colder by the Thermometer, give a more uneasy sensation of Cold than dry ones. Because (to speak like an Electrician), they conduct better, that is, are better fitted to convey away the Heat from our Bodies; The Body cannot feel without itself; Our Sensation of Cold is not in the Air without the Body, but in those Parts of the Body which have been depriv’d of their Heat by the Air. My Desk and its Lock are, I suppose of the same temperament when they have long been expos’d to the same Air; but now, if I lay my Hand on the Wood, it does not seem so cold to me as the Lock; because (as I imagine) Wood is not so good a Conductor to receive and convey away the Heat from my Skin and the adjacent Flesh, as Metal is. Take a Piece of Wood of the Size and Shape of a Dollar between the Thumb and Fingers of one Hand, and a Dollar in like manner with the other Hand; place the Edges of both at the same time in the Flame of a Candle; and tho’ the Edge of the wooden Piece takes Flame and the metal Piece does not, yet you will be oblig’d to drop the latter before the former, it conducting the Heat more suddenly to your Fingers. Thus we can without Pain handle Glass and China Cups fill’d with hot Liquors, as Tea, &amp;c. but not silver ones. A Silver Teapot must have a Wooden Handle. Perhaps it is for the same Reason that woolen Garments keep the Body warmer than Linen ones equally thick. Woolen keeping the Natural Heat in, or, in other Words, not conducting it out to Air.

** Damp winds, though not colder by the thermometer, give a  
more uneafy fenfation of cold than dry ones; becaufe (to fpeak  
like an ele€trician) they comdw better; that is, are betrer ficred  
to convey away the heat from our bodies. ‘The body cannot  
tee] withont itfelf; our fenfation of cold is not in the air awirhons  
the body, bet in thofe parts of the body which have been de,  
prived of their heat by the air. My detk, and its lock, are, I  
fuppofe, of the fame temperament when they have been long ex.  
pofed to the fame air ; but now if I lay my hand on the wood, it  
does not feem fo cold to me as the lock ; becaufe (as I imagine)  
wood is not fo good a conductor, to receive and convey away the  
heat from my fkin, and the adjacent fich, as metal is. Take a  
piece of wood, of the fize and fhape of a dollar, between the  
thumb and finger of one hand, and a dollar, in like manner, with  
the other hand ; place the edges of both at the fame time, in the  
flame of a candle ; and though the edge of the wooden piece takes  
flame, and the metal piece does not, yet you will be obliged te  
drop the latter before the former, it conducting the heat more  
fuddenly to your fingers. Thus we can, without pain, handle  
  
lafs and china cups filled with hot liquor, as tea, &amp;c. but not  
filver ones. A filver tea-pot maft have a wooden handle. Per-  
haps it is for the fame reafon that woollen garments keep the  
body warmer than linen ones equally thick ; woollen keeping  
the natural heat in, or, in other words, not conducting it out te  
air.””
