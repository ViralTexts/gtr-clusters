I receiv’d your Letter early this Morning, and as I am so engag’d that I cannot see you when you come to-day, I write this Line just to say, That I am sure you are a much better Judge in this Affair of your own than I can possibly be; in that Confidence it was that I forbore giving my Advice when you mention’d it to me, and not from any Disapprobation. My Concern (equal to any Father’s) for your Happiness, makes me write this, lest having more Regard for my Opinion than you ought, and imagining it against the Proposal because I did not immediately advise accepting it, you should let that weigh any thing in your Deliberations. I assure you that no Objection has occur’d to me; his Person you see, his Temper and his Understanding you can judge of, his Character for any thing I have ever heard is unblemished; his Profession, with that Skill in it he is suppos’d to have, will be sufficient to support a Family; and therefore considering the Fortune you have in your Hands, (tho’ any future Expectation from your Aunt should be disappointed) I do not see but that the Agreement may be a rational one on both sides. I see your Delicacy; and your Humility too; for you fancy that if you do not prove a great Fortune you will not be belov’d; but I am sure that were I in his Situation in every respect, knowing you so well as I do, and esteeming you so highly, I should think you a Fortune sufficient for me without a Shilling. Having thus more explicitly than before, given my Opinion, I leave the rest to your sound Judgment, of which no one has a greater Share; and shall not be too inquisitive after your particular Reasons, your Doubts, your Fears, &amp;c. For I shall be confident whether you accept or refuse, that you do right. I only wish you may do what will most contribute to your Happiness, and of course to mine; being ever, my dear Friend, Yours most affectionately  
BF.  
Don’t be angry with me for supposing your Determination not quite so fix’d as you fancy it

Dean rorr I received your letter sarly  
this morning, and, as I am so engaged that I  
cannot see you when you come to-day, I write  
this line just to say that I am sure you are a  
much better judge in this affair of your own  
than I can possibly be. In that confidence it  
was that I forbore giving my advice when you  
mentioned it to me, and not from any disappr­  
bation. My concern tequal to any father&#x27;s) for  
your happiness makes me write this, lest, hav­  
ing more regard for my opinion than you ought  
and imagining it against the proposal because  
I did not immedlately advise accepting it, you  
should let that weigh anything in your deliber­  
ations. I assure you that no objection has oc­  
curred to me. His person you see; his temper  
and understanding you can judge of; his char­  
acter, for anything I have ever heard, is un­  
blemished; his profession, with the skill in it  
he is supposed to have, will be sufficient to sup­  
port a family; and therofores, conaldering the  
fortune you have in your hands tthough any  
tuture cxpectatn from vour parent shouldbe  
disappointed), I do not see but that the agree­  
ment may be a rational one on both sidon   
I see your delicacy and your humility, too  
for rou fany that a tn donot prore a great  
ut I  
fortune you will not be loved; but I am sure  
were I in his situation in every respect, know­  
ing you so well as I do and esteeming you so  
highly, I should think you a fortune for me  
sufficient without a shilling  
Having thus more explicitly than before  
given my opinion, I leave the rest to your  
sound judgment, of which no one has a greater  
share, and I shall not be too inquisitive after  
your particular reasons, your doubts, your  
fears, and the like; for I shall be confident  
whether you accept or refuse, that you do right  
I only wish you may do what will most contrib  
ute to your happiness, and, of course, to mine  
being ever, my dear friend, yours most affec  
tiontelto not be angry with matoritaii btn  
P. S. Do not be angry with me for supposing  
your determination not qulte so fixed as you  
faner it
