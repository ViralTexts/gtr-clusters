The child whom a mother attended and loved;<br/>

So the multitude comes, even those we behold,<br/>
To reap every tale that has often been told.<br/>

For we are the same that our fathers have been,<br/>
We&#x27;ve seen the same sights that our fathers have seen;<br/>
We drink the same stream, and we see the same sun,<br/>
And we run the course that our fathers have run.<br/>
<br/>
The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think,<br/>
From the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink,<br/>
To the life we are clinging they also would cling;<br/>
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.<br/>
<br/>
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold,<br/>
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;<br/>
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will come;<br/>
They joyed, but the tongues of their gladness is dumb.<br/>
<br/>
They died!—ah! they died! We things that are now,<br/>
Who walk on the turf that lies over each brow,<br/>
That make in their dwellings a transient abode,<br/>
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,<br/>
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;<br/>
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,<br/>
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Tis the wink of an eye, &#x27;tis the draught of a breath,<br/>
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,<br/>
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—<br/>
Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?<br/>
