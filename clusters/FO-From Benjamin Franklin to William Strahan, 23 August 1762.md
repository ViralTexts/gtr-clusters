DEAR Sir,  
on Board  
  
Lhave been two Nights  
expecting to sail, but the  
Wind continuing contrary, am just come  
on Shore again, and have met with your  
kind Letter of the 20% I thank you  
even for the Reproofs it contains, tho’  
Ihave not altogether deserved them. I  
cannot, I assure you, quit even this dis-  
agreeable Place without regret, as it car-  
ries me still farther from those I love,  
and from the Opportunities of hearing  
of their Welfare. The Attraction of  
Reason is at present for the other Side  
of the Water, but that  
will be for this Side. You know which

I shall probably make  
but this one Vibration and settle here

to be near and with you and yours, is  
any Part of my Inducement: it would  
look like a Compliment extorted from  
  
me by your Pretences to Insignificancy.
