r me thus A Monsr. Monsieur François, chez M. de Chaumont à Passy, près de Paris.  
  
P.S. 27th Jany. They tell me that in writing to a Lady from Paris, one should always say something about the Fashions. Temple observes them more than I do. He took Notice that at the Ball in Nantes, there were no Heads less than 5, and a few were 7 Lengths of the Face, above the Top of the Forehead. You know that those who have practis’d Drawing, as he has, attend more to Proportions, than People in common do. Yesterday we din’d at the Duke de Rochefocault’s, where there were three Dutchesses and a Countess, and no Head higher than a Face and a half. So it seems the farther from Court the more extravagant the Mode.
