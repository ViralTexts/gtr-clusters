le and hearty Thanks.  
Whatever may be the Musick of the Spheres, how great soever the Harmony of the Stars, ’tis certain there is no Harmony among the Stargazers; but they are perpetually growling and snarling at one another like strange Curs, or like some Men at their Wives: I had resolved to keep the Peace on my own part, and affront none of them; and I shall persist in that Resolution: But having receiv’d much Abuse from Titan Leeds deceas’d, (Titan Leeds when living would not have us’d me so!) I say, having receiv’d much Abuse from the Ghost of Titan Leeds, who pretends to be still living, and to write Almanacks in spight of me and my Predictions, I cannot help saying, that tho’ I take it patiently, I take it very unkindly. And whatever he may pretend, ’tis undoubtedly true that he is really defunct and dead. First because the Stars are seldom disappointed, never but in the Case of wise Men, Sapiens dominabitur astris, and they fore-show’d his Death at the Time I predicted it. Secondly, ’Twas requisite and necessary he should die punctually at that Time, for the Honour of Astrology, the Art professed both by him and his Father before him. Thirdly, ’Tis plain to every one that reads his two last Almanacks (for 1734 and 35) that they are not written with that Life his Performances use to be written with; the Wit is low and flat, the little Hints dull and spiritless, nothing smart in them but Hudibras’s Verses against Astrology at the Heads of the Months in the last, which no Astrologer but a dead one would have inserted, and no Man living would or could write such Stuff as the rest. But lastly, I shall convince him from his own Words, that he is dead, (ex ore suo condemnatus est) for in his Preface to his Almanack for 1734, he says, “Saunders adds another Gross Falshood in his Almanack, viz. that by my own Calculation I shall survive until the 26th of the said Month October 1733, which is as untrue as the former.” Now if it be, as Leeds says, untrue and a gross Falshood that he surviv’d till the 26th of October 1733, then it is certainly true that he died before that Time: And if he died before that Time, he is dead now, to all Intents and Purposes, any thing he may say to the contrary notwithstanding. And at what Time before the 26th is it so likely he should die, as at the Time by me predicted, viz. the 17th of October aforesaid? But if some People will walk and be troublesome after Death, it may perhaps be born with a little, because it cannot well be avoided unless one would be at the Pains and Expence of laying them in the Red Sea; however, they should not presume too much upon the Liberty allow’d them; I know Confinement must needs be mighty irksome to the free Spirit of an Astronomer, and I am too compassionate to proceed suddenly to Extremities with it; nevertheless, tho’ I resolve with Reluctance, I shall not long defer, if it does not speedily learn to treat its living Friends with better Manners. I am, Courteous Reader, Your obliged Friend and Servant,

t of Learning, Wealth and Sense.  
  
A little House well fill’d, a little Field well till’d, and a little Wife well will’d, are great Riches.  
Old Maids lead Apes there, where the old Batchelors are turn’d to Apes.  
Some are weatherwise, some are otherwise.  
I Mon. March hath xxxi days.  
  
There’s many Men forget their proper Station,  
And still are meddling with th’ Administration  
Of Government; that’s wrong, and this is right,  
And such a Law is out of Reason quite;  
Thus spending too much Thought on State Affairs  
The Business is neglected which is theirs.  
So some fond Traveller gazing at the Stars  
Slips in next Ditch and gets a dirty Arse.  
  
Dyrro lynn y ddoeth e fydd ddoethach.  
The poor man must walk to get meat for his stomach, the rich man to get a stomach to his meat.  
He that goes far to marry, will either deceive or be deceived.  
  
Eyes and Priests  
Bear no Jests.  
  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
  
William, because his Wife was something ill,  
Uncertain in her Health, indifferent still,  
He turn’d her out of Doors without reply:  
I ask’d if he that Act could justifie.  
In Sickness and in Health, says he, I’m bound  
  
To keep her; when she’s worse or better found  
  
I’ll take her in again: And now you’ll see,  
  
She’ll quickly either mend or end, says he.  
  
The Family of Fools is ancient.  
Necessity never made a good bargain.  
If Pride leads the Van, Beggary brings up the Rear.  
There’s many witty men whose brains can’t fill their bellies.  
Weighty Questions ask for deliberate Answers.  
III Mon. May hath xxxi days.  
  
There’s nought so silly, sure, as Vanity,  
It self its chiefest End does still destroy.  
To be commended still its Brains are racking,  
But who will give it what it’s always taking?  
Thou’rt fair ’tis true; and witty too, I know it;  
And well-bred, Sally, for thy Manners show it:  
But whilst thou mak’st Self-Praise thy only Care,  
Thou’rt neither witty, nor well-bred, nor fair.  
  
When ♂ and ♀ in ☌ lie,  
Then, Maids, whate’er is ask’d of you, deny.  
  
Be slow in chusing a Friend, slower in changing.

On LOUIS the XIV. of France.  
Louis (’tis true, I own to you)  
Paid Learned Men for Writing,  
And valiant Men for Fighting:  
Himself could neither write nor fight,  
  
Nor make his People happy;  
Yet Fools will prate, and call him Great;  
Shame on their Noddles sappy.  
  
What’s given shines,  
What’s receiv’d is rusty.  
  
Sloth and Silence are a Fool’s Virtues.  
  
Of learned Fools I have seen ten times ten,  
Of unlearned wise men I have seen a hundred.  
  
Three may keep a Secret, if two of them are dead.  
Poverty wants some things, Luxury many things, Avarice all things.  
A Lie stands on 1 leg, Truth on 2.  
VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.  
  
Sam had the worst Wife that a Man could have,  
Proud, Lazy, Sot, could neither get nor save,  
Eternal Scold she was, and what is worse,  
The D---l burn thee, was her common Curse.  
Forbear, quoth Sam, that fruitless Curse so common,  
He’ll not hurt me who’ve married his Kinswoman.  
  
There’s small Revenge in Words, but Words may be greatly revenged.  
Great wits jump (says the Poet) and hit his Head against the Post.  
A man is never so ridiculous by those Qualities that are his own as by those that he affects to have.  
Deny Self for Self’s sake.  
VII Mon. September hath xxx days.  
  
Blind are the Sons of Men, few of the Kind  
Know their chief Interest, or knowing, mind:  
Most, far from following what they know is best,  
  
Trifle in earnest, but mind that in jest.  
So Hal the Fiddle tunes harmoniously,  
While all is Discord in’s Oeconomy.  
Tim moderate fare and abstinence much prizes,  
In publick, but in private gormandizes.  
  
Ever since Follies have pleas’d, Fools have been able to divert.  
It is better to take many Injuries than to give one.  
Opportunity is the great Bawd.  
VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.  
  
Little Half-wits are wondrous pert, we find,  
Scoffing and jeering on whole Womankind,  
All false, ALL Whores, ALL this and that and t’other,  
Not one Exception left, ev’n for their Mother.  
But Men of Wisdom and Experience know,  
That there’s no greater Happiness below  
Than a good Wife affords; and such there’s many,  
For every Man has one, the best of any.  
  
Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy wealthy and wise.  
To be humble to Superiors is Duty, to Equals Courtesy, to Inferiors Nobleness.  
Here comes the Orator! with his Flood of Words, and his Drop of Reason.  
IX Mon. November hath xxx days.  
  
The Lying Habit is in some so strong,  
To Truth they know not how to bend their Tongue;  
And tho’ sometimes their Ends Truth best would answer  
Yet Lies come uppermost, do what they can, Sir,  
Mendacio delights in telling News,  
And that it may be such, himself doth use  
To make it; but he now no longer need;  
Let him tell Truth, it will be News indeed.  
  
An old young man, will be a young old man.  
Sal laughs at every thing you say. Why? Because she has fine Teeth.

 these northern Colonies, of which I purpose to speak at large in my next.  
  
The Courts.  
When Popery in Britain sway’d, I’ve read,  
The Lawyers fear’d they should be damn’d when dead,  
Because they had no Saint to hand their Pray’rs,  
And in Heav’n’s Court take Care of their Affairs.  
Therefore consulting, Evanus they sent  
To Rome with a huge Purse, on this Intent  
That to the Holy Father making known  
Their woful Case, he might appoint them One.  
Being arriv’d, he offers his Complaint  
In Language smooth, and humbly begs a Saint:  
For why, says he, when others on Heav’n wou’d call,  
Physicians, Seamen, Scholars, Tradesmen, all  
Have their own Saints, we Lawyers none at all.  
The Pope was puzzel’d, never puzzel’d worse,  
For with pleas’d Eyes he saw the proffer’d Purse,  
But ne’er, in all his Knowledge or his Reading,  
He’d met with one good Man that practis’d Pleading;  
Who then should be the Saint? he could not tell.  
At length the Thing was thus concluded well.  
Within our City, says his Holiness,  
There is one Church fill’d with the Images  
  
Of all the Saints, with whom the Wall’s surrounded,  
Blindfold Evanus, lead him three times round it,  
Then let him feel (but give me first the Purse)  
And take the first he finds, for better or worse.  
Round went Evanus till he came where stood  
St. Michael with the Devil under’s Foot;  
And groping round, he seiz’d old Satan’s Head,  
This be our Saint, he cries; Amen, the Father s

3Io\v the Devil Came to be the Patron  
Saint ol&#x27; the Lawyers.  
AN ANCIENT HISTORICAL ANECDOTE.  
When Popery iu Britain swayed, I&#x27;ve read,  
The lawyers leared they would be dam&#x27;d when  
doud,  
Kecause they had no Saiut to hand their  
prayers,  
And in Heaven&#x27;s court take care of their af­  
fairs. +  
Therefore consulting, Evaiins they sent  
To Rome with a huge purse, ou this in;ent,  
That to the Holy Father makiug known  
Their woiul case, He might appoiut them one.  
Reing arrived, he opens his complaint  
In language smooth, and humbiy begs a saint;  
For why, says he, when others on Heaven  
would call,  
Physicians, seamen, scholars, tradesmen, all,  
Have their own faint, we lawyers none at all.  
The Pope was puzzied, never puzzled worse,  
For with pleas&#x27;d eyes saw he the proffered  
purse,  
r.ut ne&#x27;er in all his knwledge or his reading,  
Had met with one good man who practiced  
pleading.  
Who then should be the saint he could not  
tell;  
At length the thing was thus concluded well:  
Within our city, says his Holiness,  
There is one church ailed with the images  
Of all the Saints, with whom the wall&#x27;s sur­  
rounded ;  
Blindfold Ecu/ins, lead him three times around  
it,  
Theii let him feel, (but give me first the  
purse)  
Auii u.ku ihe first he fiuds, for better or for  
worse.  
Round went Evanns, &#x27;till he came where stood  
Saiut Michaei, wuh the Devil under foot;  
And grouping round, he seiz&#x27;d old Satan&#x27;s

#### 1896-09-01 &middot; [New York](http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
‘* Whatever may be the musick of the spheres,  
how great s»ever the harmony of the stars, &#x27;tis  
certain there is no harmony among the star-  
gazers: but they are perpetually growling and  
snarling at one another like strange curs, or like  
some men at their wives. I had resolved to keep  
the peace on my own part, and offend none of  
them ; and I shall persist in that resolution. But  
having receiv’&#x27;d much abuse from Titan Leeds  
deceas’d (Titan Leeds when living would not have  
used me so): I say, having receiv’d much abuse  
from the ghost of Titan Leeds, who pretends to  
be still living, and to write Almanacks in spight  
of me and my predictions, I can not help saying,  
that tho’ I take it patiently, I take it very unkind-  
ly. And whatever he may pretend, ’tis undoubt-  
eily true that he is really defunct and dead.  
First, because the stars are seldom disappointed,  
never but in the case of wise men, sapiens domina-  
bitur asties, and they foreshadowed his death at  
the time I predicted it. Secondly, ’twas requisite  
and necessary he should die punctually at that  
time for the honor of astrology, the art professed  
both by him and his father before him. Thirdly,  
’tis plain to every one that reads his two last Al-  
manacks (for 1734 and °35), that they are not writ-  
ten with that life his performances used to be  
written with ; the wit is low and flat; the little  
hints dull and spiritless ; nothing smart in them  
but Hudibras’s verses against astrology at the  
heads of the months in the last, which no astrol-  
oger but adead one would have inserted, and no  
man diving would or could write such stuff as the  
rest. But lastly, I shall convince him from his  
own words that he is dead (ex ors suo condemnatus  
est); for in his preface to his Almanack for 1734,  
he says: ‘Saunders adds another gross falsehood  
in his Almanack, viz., that by my own calcula-  
tion, I shall survive until the 26th of the said  
month, October, 1733, which is as untrue as the  
former.’ Nowif it be as Leeds says, untrue and  
a gross falsehood, that he survived till the 26th of  
O-tober, 1733, then it is certainly true that he  
died before that time ; and if he died before that  
time he is dead now to all intents and purposes,  
anything he may say to the contrary notwith-  
standing. And at what time before the 26th is it  
so likely he should die, as at the time by me pre-  
dicted, viz., the 17th of October aforesaid? But  
if some people will walk and be troublesome after  
death, it may perhaps be borne with a little, be-  
cause it cannot well be avoided, unless one wouid  
be at the pains and expence of laying them in the  
Red Sea ; however, they should not presume too  
much upon the liberty allowed them. I know  
confinement must needs be mighty irksome to the  
free spirit of an astronomer, and I am too com-  
passionate to proceed suddenly to extremities  
with it; nevertheless, tho’ I resolve with reluc-  
tance, I shall not long defer if it does not speed-  
ily learn to treat its living friends with better  
manners.

“ Courteous reader,

**R, SAUNDERS.”

A number of young and old folks  
fathered at Wm. Uppendahl’s place  
Sunday evening for a social chat.  
Albert Scadden is seen skirmishing  
about these parts pretty often. Ru­  
mors has it that he is cutting Millard

iave a sweetheart—l haven’t one now.

Geo. Quardfc and Wm. Uppendahl

lionsliip match of South Dakota,  
before they get through no doubt the  
whole neighborhood will be in a row  
as that is usually the case “when the  
gloves are put on.”  
The lying habit is in some so strong,  
;o tell the truth they know not how  
to bend their tongue, and though  
sometimes their ends truth best  
would answer, yet lies come upper­  
most, do what they can. If by chance  
their tongue a truth doth slip it would  
be news indeed. Remember a lie  
stands on one leg, the truth on two.
