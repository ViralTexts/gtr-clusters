Passy, June 22. 1780.  
I received duly yours of May 23. June 2, 6. 8. and 15.— Inclosed you have a Letter for the Gentleman you recommended to me. He seems to be a man of Abilities.  
  
The Words before I leave Europe, had no Relation to any Particular immediate Intention, but to the General one I flatter myself with, of being able to return and spend there the Small Remains of Life that are left me.  
I have written distinctly to Messrs. de Neufville concerning those Bills. I hear that 484 was at New Bern the 12th. of April, and soon to sail from thence or from Virginia for france. Probably he might not sail in some Weeks after, as Vessels are often longer in fitting out than was expected.— If it is the fier Rodrigue a 50 gun Ship, that he comes in, I have just heard that She would not sail till the Middle of may.  
Herewith you have the Judgment relating to the flora, which I thought had been sent before.  
The Mischiefs done by the Mob in London are astonishing! They were, I hear within an Ace of destroying the Bank with all the Books relating to the funds, which would have created infinite confusion. I am grieved at the Loss of Charlestown. Let us hope soon to hear better News from the Operations of the french and Spanish forces gone to America.  
With great Esteem, I am ever Dear Sir, Your &amp;c.  
M. Dumas  
  
II.  
Dear Sir  
Passy, June 22. 1780.  
As the English do not allow that we can make legal Prizes, they certainly cannot detain the Dutch Ship the Berkenboos, on Pretence that it was become american Property before they took it, for the rest there is no doubt but the Congress will do what shall appear to be just, on a Proper Representation of facts laid before them, which the Owners should appoint some Person in America to do. Those Gentlemen may depend on my rendering them every service in my Power.

Passy, Fune 22, 1780.  
Dear Sir,  
  
I received duly yours of May 25, June 2, 6, 8,  
and 15. Inclosed yeu have a letter for the gen-  
tleman you recommend to me. Ile scemsto be  
a man of abilities.  
  
The words defore I leave Europe, had no rela-  
tion to any particular immediate intention, but  
to the general one I flatter myself with, of being  
able to return and spend there the small remains  
of life that are left me.  
  
I have written distinctly to Messrs. De Neuf-  
ville concerning those bills. T hear that 484 was  
at Newbern the 12th of April, and soon to sail  
from thence, or from Virginia for France. Pro-  
bably he might not sailin some weeks after, as  
vessels are often longer in fitting out than was  
expected, if itis the Fies Kodrique, a 90 gun ship  
that he comes in,I have just heard that she would  
not sail till the middie of May.  
  
Herewith you have the judgment relating to  
the Flora, which I thought had been sent before.  
The mischiefs done by the mob in London are  
astonishing! They were I hear within an ace  
of destroying the bank, with all the books relat-  
ing tothe funds, which would have created in-  
finite confusion.  
  
I am grieved at the loss of Charleston. Let  
us hope soon to hear better news from the ope-  
rations of the French and Spanish forces, gone  
to America.  
  
With great esteem, I am ever, dear  
  
Sir, your most obedient, and most  
  
humble servant.  
  
B. FRANKLIN.  
  
M. Dumas.  
  
Passy, Fune 22, 1780.  
Dear Sir,  
  
As the English do not allow that we can

Congress will do what shall appear to be just,  
ona proper representation of facts laid before
