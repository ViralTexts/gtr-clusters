ns Experiments on the conducting Power of various other Substances, viz. Ice, hot Glass, hot baked Wood, the Effluvia of flaming Bodies, melted Tallow, Oil of Olives, essential Oils of various Sorts, saline Substances of various kinds, black Sand, black Lead (which was unexpectedly found equally a good Conductor with Metal or Charcoal) various Stony Substances, Spars, &amp;c. which afford a Number of Observations that are new and curious.  
Sect. V. contains Experiments on the Diffusion of Electricity over the Surface of Glass Tubes, and showing a new Method of giving the electric Shock. These Experiments were partly made on new Flint Glass, which was found to differ greatly from Glass some Months old in regard to that Property ascrib’d to Glass of its being absolutely a Non Conductor. The Experiments are many and varied very ingeniously, particularly those relating to the new Method of giving a Shock, and tend to throw new Light on this Part of the Science.  
Sect. VI. contains a Number of Experiments tending to verify several Particulars of P. Beccaria’s Theory concerning the electric Ma
