Dec. 21. 1757  
The following is what I can at present recollect, relating to the Effects of Electricity in Paralytic Cases, which have fallen under my Observation.  
Some Years since, when the News papers made Mention of great Cures perform’d in Italy or Germany by means of Electricity, a Number of Paralytics were brought to me from different Parts of Pensilvania and the neighbouring Provinces, to be electris’d, which I did for them, at their Request. My Method was, to place the Patient first in a Chair on an electric Stool, and draw a Number of large strong Sparks from all Parts of the affected Limb or Side. Then I fully charg’d two 6 Gallon Glass Jarrs, each of which had about 3 square feet of Surface coated and I sent the united Shock of these thro’ the affected Limb or Limbs, repeating the Stroke commonly three Times each Day. The first Thing observ’d was an immediate greater sensible Warmth in the lame Limbs that had receiv’d the Stroke than in the others; and the next Morning the Patients usually related that they had in the Night felt a pricking Sensation in the Flesh of the paralytic Limbs, and would sometimes shew a Number of small red Spots which they suppos’d were occasion’d by those Prickings: The Limbs too were found more capable of voluntary Motion, and seem’d to receive Strength; a Man, for Instance, who could not, the first Day, lift the lame Hand from off his Knee, would the next Day raise it four or five Inches, the third Day higher, and on the fifth Day was able, but with a feeble languid Motion, to take off his Hat. These Appearances gave great Spirits to the Patients, and made them hope a perfect Cure; but I do not remember that I ever saw any Amendment after the fifth Day: Which the Patients perceiving, and finding the Shocks pretty severe, they became discourag’d, went home and in a short time relapsed; so that I never knew any Advantage from Electricity in Palsies that was permanent. And how far the apparent temporary Advantage might arise from the Exercise in the Patients Journey and coming daily to my House, or from the Spirits given by the Hope of Success, enabling them to exert more Strength in moving their Limbs, I will not pretend to say.  
Perhaps some permanent Advantage might have been obtained, if the Electric Shocks had been accompanied with proper Medicine and Regimen, under the Direction of a skilful Physician. It may be, too, that a few great Strokes, as given in my Method, may not be so proper as many small ones; since by the Account from Scotland of the Case in which 200 Shocks from a Phial were given daily, seems that a perfect Cure has been made. As to any uncommon Strength supposed to be in the Machine used in that Case, [I] imagine it could have no Share in the Effect produced; since the Strength of the Shock from charg’d Glass, is in proportion to the Quantity of Surface of the Glass coated; [so] that my Shocks from those large Jarrs must have been much greater than any that could be received from a Phial held in the hand.  
I am, with great Respect, Sir, Your most obedient Servant

i Ronn following is what I can at  
prefent recolle, relating to the  
effects of electricity in paralytic cafes,  
which have fallen under my obferva-  
tion.  
  
Some years fince, when the news-  
papers made mention of great cures  
performed in Jtaly or Germany, by  
means of eleGtricity, a number of para-  
lytics were brought to me from differ-  
ent parts of Penfylvania, and the neigh  
bouring provinces, to be electrifed ;  
which I did for chem at their requelt.  
My method was, to place the patient  
firlt in achair, on an eleétric {tool,  
and draw a number of large {trong  
fparks from all parts of the affected  
limb or fide. Then I fully charged  
two fix-gallon glafs jars, each of which  
had about three fect of furface coated;  
and I fent the united fhock of thele  
thro’ the affe&amp;ted limb or limbs; re  
peating the {troke commonly three times  
each day. The firft thing obferved was  
an immediate greater fenfible warmth  
in the lame limbs, that had received  
the {troke, than in the others: and the  
next morning the patients ufually re  
lated, that they had in the night felt a  
pricking fenfation in the fieth of the  
paralytic limbs ; and would fometimes  
fhew a number of {mall red f{pots, which  
they fuppofed were occafioned by thol¢  
  
prick-  
  
  
  
  
  
For  
  
tickings.. The limbs too were found  
more capable of voluntary motion, and  
feemed to.receive firength. A man,  
foriattance, who could not the firlt day  
lift the lame. hand; from off his knee,  
  
_would.the next day raife jt four or five |  
  
inches, the third day higher ;, and on  
the fifth, day was able, but with a feeble  
Janguid ‘motion, to. take off, his. hat.  
.Thele appearances. gave great fpirits  
to the.patients, and made them hope  
  
aperfect.cure ; but Ido not remember, |  
  
that. Lever faw any amendment after  
the fifth day: which the patients per-  
-eciving, and finding the fhocks pretty  
  
fevere, they became difcouraged, went .  
home; and.in a fhort time relapfed ; {o .  
  
that I never knew any advantage from  
  
eleGricity in palftes, that was perma- .  
  
nent,. And how far the apparent tem-  
potary-advantage might srife from the  
exercife in the patients’ journey, and  
taming’daily&#x27;to my houfe, or from the  
ppirits ‘given ‘by the hope of .fuccefs,

‘Perhaps fome permanent advantage  
might have been obtained, if the electric  
thocks had been accompanied with pro-

diredtion-of a fkilful phyfician. . It may  
be, :too, that a few, great itrokes, .as  
given in my metbod, may not be fo  
Proper as many {mall ones; fince, by  
the account from Scotland of a cafe, in  
Which two hundred fhocks from a phiel  
Were given daily, it feems, that a per-

common .ftrength fuppofed to be in the  
machine ufed in that cafe, I imagine it  
could have no fhare ia the effect pro-  
duced: fince the ftrength of the fhock  
m charged glafs is in proportion to  
the quantity of furface of the glafs coat-  
ed; fo that my fhocks from thofe large  
Jits mult have been much greater than  
any, that could be received from a

Sir,  
  
HE following is what I can  
at prefent recolle&amp;, relating  
to the effects of clericity in para-  
lytic cafes, which have fallen under  
my obfervation.  
Some years fince, when the newf-  
papers made mention of great cures  
formed in Italy or Germany,  
“ means of eleétricity, a number  
qf paralytics were brought to me  
from different parts of Pennfylva-

ces, to be elettrifed; which I did  
for them at their requelt. My me-  
thod was, to place the patient firlt  
in a chair, on an ele¢tric ftool,- and  
draw a number of large ftrong  
fparks from all parts of the affeéted  
linib or fide. Then I fully charged  
two fix gallon glafs jars, each of  
which had about three {quare feet  
of furface coated; and I fent the  
united fhock of thefe through the  
affected limb or limbs; repeating  
the froke commonly three times  
gachday. The firlt thing obferved  
Was an immediate greater fenfible  
  
dia Letter to Dr. Princre, from B. Rankin,  
  
warmth in the lame limks, that had  
received the ftroke, than in the  
others: and the next morning the  
patients ufually related, that they.  
had in the night felt a pricking fen-  
fation in the flefh of the paralytic  
limbs ; and would fometimes fhew  
a number of fmall red fpots, which  
thev fuppofed were occafioned by  
thole prickings. The limbs, too,  
were found more capable of volun-  
tary motion, and feemed to receive  
ftrength. A man, for inftance,  
who could not the firft day lift the  
lame hand from off hisknee, would  
the next day raile it four or five  
inches, the third day higher, and  
  
.on the fifth day was able, but with’  
  
a feeble languid motion, to take off  
his hat. ‘Thefe appearances gave  
great f{pirits to the patients, and  
made. them hope a perfeét cure;  
but I do not remember, that I ever

Account of the effects of eleAricity in  
paralytic cafes. In aa letter to dr.  
Pringle, from dr, Frankizn,  
  
S° ME years fince, when the newf-  
  
papers made mention of great  
cures performed in Italy or Ger-  
many, by means of electricity, a num-  
ber of paralytics were brought to me  
from Pennfylvania, and the neigh-  
bouring provinces, to be eieetr:fed ;  
which I did for them at their requeft.  
  
My method was, firfl to plaice the pa-  
  
tientina chair, on an electric fool,  
  
and draw a number of large throng  
fparks, from all paris of the atletted  
limb or fide. Then I fully charged  
two fix gallon glafs jars, cach of wach  
had about three {quare feet of lurface  
coated ; and | fent the unied hock of

the fe through the affeéted limb or limbs,  
repeating the flroke commonly three  
times each day, The firfl thing obferv-  
ed was an immediate greater fenfible  
warmth inthe lame Iimbs, that had re-  
ceived the liroke,than in the others: and  
the next morning, the patients ufually  
related, that they had, in the n‘ghre,  
felt a pricking fenfation in the fleth of  
the paralytic limbs ; and would fome-  
times fhew a number of {mall red fpots,  
which, they fuppofed, were occafion-  
ed by thefe prickings. The limbs,  
too, were found more capable of vo-  
luntary motion, and feemed to receive  
firength. A man, for inflance, who  
could not, the rfl day, lift the lame  
hand from off his knee, would the  
next day, ra‘fe it four or five inches, the  
third day h&#x27;gher, and, on the fifth day  
was able, but with a feeble languid  
morion, to take of his har.  
  
Thefe appearances gave great fpt-  
vits to the patients, and made them  
hope a perfett cure; but I do nat re-  
ymemb_r, that I ever faw any amend-  
ment after the fifth day: which the  
ral ents perceiving, and finding the  
ihocks pretty fevere, they became dif-  
couraged, went home, and in a fhort  
time relapfed ; fo chat, in palfies, I ne-  
ver knew any advanrage from elettri-  
city, that was permanent. And how  
far the apparent temporary advantage  
might arife from the exercife of the  
patient’s journey, and coming daily to  
my houfe, or from the fpirits, given  
by the hope of fuccefs, enabling them  
1 exert more ftrength in moving their  
limbs, { will not pretend to fay.  
  
Perhaps fome permanent. advantage  
might have been obtained, if the elec-  
tric fhocks had been accompanied  
wth proper medicine and regimen,  
under the direétions of a fkilful phy-  
fician. .It may be, too, that a few  
great ftrokes, as given in my method,  
may not be fo proper, as many {mall  
ones: fince, by the account, from  
Scotland. of a cafe, in which two  
hundred fhocks froma phial were given  
daily, it feems, that a perfect cure has  
been made. As to any uncommon  
firength, fuppofed to be in the machine  
ufed in that cafe, I imagine it could  
have no fhare in the effect produced ;  
fince the flrength of the fhock, from  
charged ylafs 1s in proportion to the  
evantity of furface of the glafs coated ;  
iu that my fhocks, from thofe large  
  
  
  
[July,  
  
jars, muft have been much greater,  
than any that could be received from  
a phial held in the hand.
