, that if the cession of Canada would be a real advantage to us, we may demand it under his second head, as an “indemnification for the charges incurred” in recovering our just rights; otherwise according to his own principles the demand of Guadaloupe can have no foundation.  
That “our claims before the war were large enough for possession and for security too,”  
†Ibid.  
tho’ it seems a clear point with the ingenious remarker, is, I own, not so with me. I am rather of the contrary opinion, and shall presently give my reasons. But first let me observe, that we did not make those claims because they were large enough for security, but because we could rightfully claim no more. Advantages gain’d in the course of this war, may increase the extent of our rights. Our claims before the war contain’d some security; but that is no reason why we should neglect acquiring more when the demand of more is become reasonable. It may be reasonable in the case of America to ask for the security recommended by the author of the letter, tho’  
‡P. 30 of the Letter, and p. 21 of the Remarks.  
it would be preposterous to do it in many other cases: his propos’d demand is founded on the little value of Canada to the French; the right we have to ask, and the power we may have to insist on an indemnification for our expences; the difficulty the French themselves will be under of restraining their restless subjects in America from encroaching on our limits and disturbing our trade; and the difficulty on our parts of preventing encroachments that may possibly exist many years without coming to our knowledge. But the remarker “does not see why the arguments employ’d concerning a security for a peaceable behaviour in Canada, would not be equally cogent for calling for the same security in Europe.”  
*Remarks, p. 24.  
On a little farther reflection, he must I think be sensible, that the circumstances of the two cases are widely different. Here we are separated by the best and clearest of boundaries, the ocean, and we have people in or near every part of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon us, by building a fort, even in the obscurest corner of these islands, must therefore be known and prevented immediately. The aggressors also must be known, and the nation they belong to would be accountable for their aggression. In America it is quite otherwise. A vast wilderness thinly or scarce at all peopled, conceals with ease the march of troops and workmen. Important passes may be seiz’d within our limits and forts built in a month, at a small expence, that may cost us an age, and a million to remove. Dear experience has taught us this. But what is still worse, the wide extended forests between our settlements and theirs, are inhabited by barbarous tribes of savages that delight in war and take pride in murder, subjects properly neither of the French nor English, but strongly attach’d to the former by the art and indefatigable industry of priests, similarity of superstitions, and frequent family alliances. These are easily, and have been continually, instigated to fall upon and massacre our planters, even in times of full peace between the two crowns, to the certain

*Remarks, p. 25.  
No nation that has carried on a war with disadvantage, and is unable to continue it, can be said, under such circumstances, to be independent; and while either side thinks itself in a condition to demand an indemnification, there is no man in his senses, but will, caeteris paribus prefer an indemnification that is a cheaper and more effectual security than any other he can think of.

Even that of 1733, which she commenced with declarations of her having no ambitious views, and which finished by a treaty at which the ministers of France repeatedly declared that she desired nothing for herself, in effect gained for her Lorrain, an indemnification ten times the value of all her North American possessions.

e does it not merely to serve the purposes of a dangerous ambition. Canada in the hands of Britain, will endanger the kingdom of France as little as any other cession; and from its situation and circumstances cannot be hurtful to any other state. Rather, if peace be an advantage, this cession may be such to all Europe. The present war teaches us, that disputes arising in America, may be an occasion of embroiling nations who have no concerns there. If the French remain in Canada and Louisiana, fix the boundaries as you will between us and them, we must border on each other for more than 1500 miles. The people that inhabit the frontiers, are generally the refuse of both nations, often of the worst morals and the least discretion, remote from the eye, the prudence, and the restraint of government.

he remarker thinks we shall be sufficiently secure in America, if we “raise English forts at such passes as may at once make us respectable to the French and to the Indian nations.”  
*Remarks, p. 25.  
The security desirable in America, may be considered as of three kinds; 1. A security of possession, that the French shall not drive us out of the country. 2. A security of our planters from the inroads of savages, and the murders committed by them. 3. A security that the British nation shall not be oblig’d on every new war to repeat the immense expence occasion’d by this, to defend its possessions in America. Forts in the most important passes, may, I acknowledge be of use to obtain the first kind of security: but as those situations are far advanc’d beyond the inhabitants, the expence of maintaining and supplying the garrisons, will be very great even in time of full peace, and immense on every interruption of it; as it is easy for skulking parties of the enemy in such long roads thro’ the woods, to intercept and cut off our convoys, unless guarded continually by great bodies of men. The second kind of security, will not be obtained by such forts, unless they were connected by a wall like that of China, from one end of our settlements to the other. If the Indians when at war, march’d like the Europeans, with great armies, heavy cannon, baggage and carriages, the passes thro’ which alone such armies could penetrate our country or receive their supplies, being secur’d, all might be sufficiently secure; but the case is widely different. They go to war, as they call it, in small parties, from fifty men down to five. Their hunting life has made them acquainted with the whole country, and scarce any part of it is impracticable to such a party. They can travel thro’ the woods even by night, and know how to conceal their tracks. They pass easily between your forts undiscover’d; and privately approach the settlements of your frontier inhabitants. They need no convoys of

, by constantly hunting in the woods, are perfectly well acquainted with; whereas the English know little or nothing of the Indian country nor of the passages thro’ the woods that lead to it. The Indian way of making war is by sudden attacks upon exposed places; and as soon as they have done mischief, they retire and either go home by the same or some different rout, as they think safest; or go to some other place at a distance to renew their stroke. If a sufficient party should happily be ready to pursue them, it is a great chance, whether in a country consisting of woods and swamps which the English are not acquainted with, the enemy do not lie in ambush for them in some convenient place, and from thence destroy them. If this should not be the case, but the English should pursue them, as soon as they have gained the rivers, by means of their canoes, to the use

In short, long experience has taught our planters, that they cannot rely upon forts as a security against Indians: The inhabitants of Hackney might as well rely upon the tower of London to secure them against highwaymen and housebreakers. As to the third kind of security, that we shall not in a few years, have all we have now done to do over again in America; and be oblig’d to employ the same number of troops, and ships, at the same immense expence to defend our possessions there, while we are in proportion weaken’d here: such forts I think cannot prevent this. During a peace, it is not to be doubted the French, who are adroit at fortifying, will likewise erect forts in the most advantageous places of the country we leave them, which will make it more difficult than ever to be reduc’d in case of another war. We know by the experience of this war, how extremely difficult it is to march an army thro’ the American woods, with its necessary cannon and stores, sufficient to reduce a very slight fort. The accounts at the treasury will tell you what amazing sums we have necessarily spent in the expeditions against two very trifling forts, Duquesne and Crown Point. While the French retain their influence over the Indians, they can easily keep our long extended frontier in continual alarm, by a very few of those people; and with a small number of regulars and militia, in such a country, we find they can keep an a

rolls.  
Now all the kinds of security we have mention’d are obtain’d by subduing and retaining Canada. Our present possessions in America, are secur’d; our planters will no longer be massacred by the Indians, who depending absolutely on us for what are now become the necessaries of life to them, guns, powder, hatchets, knives, and cloathing; and having no other Europeans near, that can either supply them, or instigate them against us; there is no doubt of their being always dispos’d, if we treat them with common justice, to live in perpetual peace with us. And with regard to France, she cannot in case of another war, put us to the immense expence of defending that long extended frontier; we shall then, as it were, have our backs against a wall in America, the sea-coast will be easily protected by our superior naval power; and here “our own watchfulness and our own strength” will be properly, and cannot but be successfully employed. In this situation the force now employ’d in that part of the world, may be spar’d for any other service here or elsewhere; so that both the offensive and defensive strength of the British empire on the whole will be greatly increased.

e only. It is a great mistake to imagine that the American country in question between Great Britain and France, is claimed as the property of any individuals or publick body in America, or that the possession of it by Great Britain, is likely, in any lucrative view, to redound at all to the advantage of any person there. On the other hand, the bulk of the inhabitants of North America are land-owners, whose lands are inferior in value to those of Britain, only by the want of an equal number of people. It is true the accession of the large territory claimed before the war began, especially if that be secured by the possession of Canada, will tend to the increase of the British subjects faster than if they had been confin’d within the mountains: yet the increase within the mountains only, would evidently make the comparative population equal to that of Great Britain much sooner than it can be expected when our people are spread over a country six times as large. I think this is the only point of light in which this question is to be viewed, and is the only one in which any of the colonies are concerned. No colony, no possessor of lands in any colony, therefore wishes for conquests, or can be benefited by them, otherwise than as they may be a means of securing peace on their borders. No considerable advantage has resulted to the colonies by the conquests of this war, or can result from confirming them by the peace, but what they must enjoy in common with the rest of the British people; with this evident drawback from their share of these advantages, that they will necessarily lessen, or at least prevent the increase of the value of what makes the principal part of their private property. A people spread thro’ the whole tract of country on this side the Mississipi, and secured by Canada in our hands, would probably for some centuries find employment in agriculture, and thereby free us at home effectually from our fears of American manufactures. Unprejudic’d men well know that all the penal and prohibitory laws that ever were thought on, will not be sufficient to prevent manufactures in a country whose inhabitants surpass the number that can subsist by the husbandry of it. That this will be the case in America soon, if our people remain confined within the mountains, and almost as soon should it be unsafe for them to live beyond, tho’ the country be ceded to us, no man acquainted with political and commercial history can doubt. Manufactures are founded in poverty. It is the multitude of poor without land in a country, and who must work for others at low wages or starve, that enables undertakers to carry on a manufacture, and afford it cheap enough to prevent the importation of the same kind from abroad, and to bear the expence of its own exportation. But no man who can have a piece of land of his own, sufficient by his labour to subsist his family in plenty, is poor enough to be a manufacturer and work for a master. Hence while there is land enough in America for our people, there can never be manufactures to any amount or value. It is a striking observation of a very able pen, that the natural livelihood of the thin inhabitants of a forest country, is hunting; that of a greater number, pasturage; that of a middling population, agriculture; and that of the greatest, manufactures; which last must subsist the bulk of the people in a full country, or they must be subsisted by charity, or perish. The extended population, therefore, that is most advantageous to Great Britain, will be best effected, because only effectually secur’d by our possession of Canada. So far as the being of our present colonies in North

. Canada in the hands of France has always stinted the growth of our colonies: In the course of this war, and indeed before it, has disturb’d and vex’d even the best and strongest of them, has found means to murder thousands of their people and unsettle a great part of their country. Much more able will it be to starve the growth of an infant settlement. Canada has also found means to make this nation spend two or three millions a year in America; and a people, how small soever, that in their present situation, can do this as often as we have a war with them, is methinks, “an enemy to be apprehended.”

, (at length it comes out) if the French are not left there to check the growth of our colonies, “they will extend themselves almost without bounds into the in-land parts, and increase infinitely from all causes; becoming a numerous, hardy, independent people, possessed of a strong country, communicating little or not at all with England, living wholly on their own labour, and in process of time knowing little and enquiring little about the mother country.” In short, according to this writer, our present colonies are large enough and numerous enough, and the French ought to be left in North America to prevent their increase, lest they become not only useless but dangerous to Britain.

causes.” The very reason he assigns for their so extending, and which is indeed the true one, their being “invited to it by the pleasantness, fertility and plenty of the country,” may satisfy us, that this extension will continue to proceed as long as there remains any pleasant fertile country within their reach. And if we even suppose them confin’d by the waters of the Mississipi westward, and by those of St. Laurence and the lakes to the northward, yet still we shall leave them room enough to increase even in the sparse manner of settling now practis’d there, till they amount to perhaps a hundred millions of souls. This must take some centuries to fulfil, and in the mean time, this nation must necessarily supply them with the manufactures they consume, because the new settlers will be employ’d in agriculture, and the new settlements will so continually draw off the spare hands from the old, that our present colonies will not, during the period we have mention’d find themselves in a condition to manufacture even for their own inhabitants, to any considerable degree, much less for those who are settling behind them. Thus our trade must, till that country becomes as fully peopled as England, that is for centuries to come, be continually increasing, and with it our naval power; because the ocean is between us and them, and our ships and seamen must increase as that trade increases.

But, say the objectors, “there is a certain distance from the sea, in America, beyond which the expence of carriage will put a stop to the sale and consumption of your manufactures; and this, with the difficulty of making returns for them, will oblige the inhabitants to manufacture for themselves; of course, if you suffer your people to extend their settlements beyond that distance, your people become useless to you:” and this distance is limited by some to 200 miles, by others to the Apalachian mountains. Not to insist on a very plain truth, that no part of a dominion, from whence a government may on occasion draw supplies and aids both of men of money, tho’ at too great a distance to be supply’d with manufactures from some other part, is therefore to be deem’d useless to the whole; I shall endeavour to show that these imaginary limits of utility, even in point of commerce are much too narrow.  
The inland parts of the continent of Europe are much farther from the sea than the limits of settlement proposed for America. Germany is full of tradesmen and artificers of all kinds, and the governments there, are not all of them always favourable to the commerce of Britain, yet it is a well-known fact, that our manufactures find their way even into the heart of Germany. Ask the great manufacturers and merchants of the Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Manchester and Norwich goods, and they will tell you, that some of them send their riders frequently thro’ France or Spain and Italy, up to Vienna and back thro’ the middle and northern parts of Germany, to show samples of their wares and collect orders, which they receive by almost every mail, to a vast amount. Whatever charges arise on the carriage of goods, are added to the value, and all paid by the consumer. If these nations over whom we have no government, over whose consumption we can have no influence, but what arises from the cheapness and goodness of our wares; whose trade, manufactures, or commercial connections are not subject to the controul of our laws, as those of our colonies certainly are in some degree: I say, if these nations purchase and consume such quantities of our goods, notwithstanding the remoteness of their situation from the sea; how much less likely is it that the settlers in America, who must for ages be employ’d in agriculture chiefly, should make cheaper for themselves the goods our manufacturers at present supply them with; even if we suppose the carriage five, six or seven hundred miles from the sea as difficult and expensive as the like distance into Germany: whereas in the latter, the natural distances are frequently doubled by political obstructions, I mean the intermix’d territories and clashing interests of princes. But when we consider that the inland parts of America are penetrated by great navigable rivers; that there are a number of great lakes, communicating with each other, with those r

that the sea coasts (if one may be allow’d the expression) of those lakes only, amount at least to 2700 miles, exclusive of the rivers running into them; many of which are navigable to a great extent for boats and canoes, thro’ vast tracts of country; how little likely is it that the expence on the carriage of our goods into those countries, should prevent the use of them. If the poor Indians in those remote parts are now able to pay for the linnen, woolen and iron wares they are at present furnish’d with by the French and English traders, tho’ Indians have nothing but what they get by hunting, and the goods are loaded with all the impositions fraud and knavery can contrive to inhance their value; will not industrious English farmers, hereafter settled in those countries, be much better able to pay for what shall be brought them in the way of fair commerce?  
If it is asked, what can such farmers raise, wherewith to pay for the manufactures they may want from us? I answer, that the inland parts of America in question are well-known to be fitted for the production of hemp, flax, potash, and above all silk; the southern parts, may produce olive oil, raisins, currans, indigo, and cochineal. Not to mention horses and black cattle, which may easily be driven to the maritime markets, and at the same time assist in conveying other commodities. That the commodities first mention’d, may easily by water or land carriage be brought to the sea ports from interior America, will not seem incredible, when we reflect, that hemp formerly came from the Ukraine and most southern parts of Russia to Wologda, and down the Dwina to Archangel, and thence by a perilous navigation round the North Cape to England and other parts of Europe. It now comes from the same country up the Dnieper and down the Duna with much land carriage. Great part of the Russia iron, no high-priced commodity, is brought 3000 miles by land and water from the heart of Siberia. Furs, [the produce too of America] are brought to Amsterdam from all parts of Siberia, even the most remote, Kamschatska. The same country furnishes me with another instance of extended inland commerce. It is found worth while to keep up a mercantile communication between Peking in China and Petersburgh. And none of these instances of inland commerce exceed those of the courses by which, at several periods, the whole trade of the East was carried on.

 cent. on the value, and amounts to £28 per ton.  
If the growths of a country find their way out of it, the manufactures of the countries where they go will infallibly find their way into it. They who understand the oeconomy and principles of manufactures, know, that it is impossible to establish them in places not populous; and even in those that are populous, hardly possible to establish them to the prejudice of the places already in possession of them. Several attempts have been made in France and Spain, countenanced by the government, to draw from us and establish in those countries, our hard-ware and woolen manufactures, but without success. The reasons are various. A manufacture is part of a great system of commerce, which takes in conveniencies of various kinds, methods of providing materials of all sorts, machines for expediting and facilitating labour, all the channels of correspondence for vending the wares, the credit and confidence necessary to found and support this correspondence, the mutual aid of different artizans, and a thousand other particulars, which time and long experience have gradually established. A part of such a system cannot support itself without the whole, and before the whole can be obtained the part perishes. Manufactures where they are in perfection, are carried on by a multiplicity of hands, each of which is expert only in his own part, no one of them a master of the whole; and if by any means spirited away to a foreign country, he is lost without his fellows. Then it is a matter of the extremest difficulty to persuade a compleat set of workmen, skilled in all parts of a manufactory to leave their country together and settle in a foreign land. Some of the idle and drunken may be enticed away, but these only disappoint their employers, and serve to discourage the undertaking. If by royal munificence, and an expence that the profits of the trade alone would not bear a compleat set of good and skilful hands are collected and carried over, they find so much of the system imperfect, so many things wanting to carry on the trade to advantage, so many difficulties to overcome, and the knot of hands so easily broken, by death, dissatisfaction and desertion, that they and their employers are discouraged together, and the project vanishes into smoke. Hence it happens, that established manufactures are hardly ever lost, but by foreign conquest, or by some eminent interior fault in manners or government; a bad police oppressing and discouraging the workmen, or religious persecutions driving the sober and industrious out of the country. There is in short, scarce a single instance in history of the contrary, where manufactures have once taken firm root. They sometimes start up in a new place, but are generally supported like exotic plants at more expence than they are worth for any thing but curiosity, until these new seats become the refuge of the man

As to the common-place objection to the North American settlements, that they are in the same climate and their produce the same as that of England; in the first place it is not true; it is particularly not so of the countries now likely to be added to our settlements; and of our present colonies, the products, lumber, tobacco, rice and indigo, great articles of commerce do not interfere with the products of England: in the next place, a man must know very little of the trade of the world, who does not know, that the greater part of it is carried on between countries whose climate differs very little. Even the trade between the different parts of these British islands, is greatly superior to that between England and all the West-India islands put together.

Our trade to the West-India islands is undoubtedly a valuable one: but whatever is the amount of it, it has long been at a stand. Limited as our sugar planters are by the scantiness of territory, they cannot increase much beyond their present number; and this is an evil, as I shall show hereafter, that will be little helped by our keeping Guadaloupe. The trade to our Northern Colonies, is not only greater, but yearly increasing with the increase of people: and even in a greater proportion, as the people increase in wealth and the ability of spending as well as in numbers. I have already said, that our people in the Northern Colonies double in about 25 years, exclusive of the accession of strangers. That I speak within bounds, I appeal to the authentic accounts frequently required by the board of trade, and transmitted to that board by the respective governors; of which accounts I shall select

f its inhabitants, and the most suspected of carrying on manufactures on account of the number of German artizans, who are known to have transplanted themselves into that country, though even these, in truth, when they come there, generally apply themselves to agriculture as the surest support and most advantageous employment. By this account it appears, that the exports to that province have in 28 years, increased nearly in the proportion of 17 to 1; whereas the people themselves, who by other authentic accounts appear to double their numbers (the strangers who settle there included) in about 16 years, cannot in the 28 years have increased in a greater proportion than as 4 to 1: the additional demand then, and consumption of goods from England, of 13 parts in 17 more than the additional number would require, must be owing to this, that the people having by their industry mended their circumstances, are enabled to indulge themselves in finer cloaths, better furniture, and a more general use of all our manufactures than heretofore. In fact, the occasion for English goods in North America, and the inclination to have and use them, is, and must be for ages to come, much greater than the ability of the people to pay for them; they must therefore, as they now do, deny themselves many things they would otherwise chuse to have, or increase their industry to obtain them; and thus, if they should at any time manufacture some coarse article, which on account of its bulk or some other circumstance, cannot so well be brought to them from Britain, it only enables them the better to pay for finer goods that otherwise they could not indulge themselves in: So that the exports thither are not diminished by such manufacture but rather increased. The single article of manufacture in these colonies mentioned by the remarker, is hats made in New-England. It is true there have been ever since the first settlement of that country, a few hatters there, drawn thither probably at first by the facility of getting beaver, while the woods were but little clear’d, and there was plenty of those animals. The case is greatly alter’d now. The beaver skins are not now to be had in New England, but from very remote places and at great prices. The trade is accordingly declining there, so that, far from being able to make hats in any quantity for exportation, they cannot supply their home demand; and it is well known that some thousand dozens are sent thither yearly from London, and sold there cheaper than the inhabitants can make them of equal goodness. In fact, the colonies are so little suited for establishing of manufactures, that they are continually losing the few branches they accidentally gain. The working brasiers, cutlers, and pewterers, as well as hatters, who have happened to go over from time to time and settle in the colonies, gradually drop the working part of their business, and import their respective goods from England, whence they can have them cheaper and better than they can make them. They continue their shops indeed, in the same way of dealing, but become sellers of brasiery, cutlery, pewter, hats, &amp;c. brought from England, instead of being makers of those goods.  
Thus much as to the apprehension of our colonies becoming useless to us. I shall next consider the other supposition, that their growth may render them dangerous. Of this I own, I have not the least conception, when I consider that we have already fourteen separate governments on the maritime coast of the continent, and if we extend our settlements shall probably have as many more behind them on the inland side. Those we now have, are not only under different governors, but have different forms of government, different laws, different interests, and some of them different religious persuasions and different manners. Their jealousy of each other is so great that however necessary an union of the colonies has long been, for their common defence and security against their enemies, and how sensible soever each colony has been of that necessity, yet they have never been able to effect such an union among themselves, nor even to agree in requesting the mother country to establish it for them. Nothing but the immediate command of the crown has been able to produce even the imperfect union but lately seen there, of the forces of some colonies. If they could not agree to unite for their defence against the French and Indians, who were perpetually harassing their settlements, burning their villages, and murdering their people; can it reasonably be supposed there is any danger of their uniting against their own nation, which protects and encourages them, with which they have so many connections and ties of blood, interest and affection, and which ’tis well known they all love much more than they love one another? In short, there are so many causes that must operate to prevent it, that I will venture to say, an union amongst them for such a purpose is not merely improbable, it is impossible; and if the union of the whole is impossible, the attempt of a part must be madness: as those colonies that did not join the rebellion, would join the mother country in suppressing it.  
When I say such an union is impossible, I mean without the most grievous tyranny and oppression. People who have property in a country which they may lose, and privileges which they may endanger; are generally dispos’d to be quiet; and even to bear much, rather than hazard all. While the government is mild and just, while important civil and religious rights are secure, such subjects will be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not rise, but when the winds blow.

e disadvantages, so difficult is it to overturn an established government, that it was not without the assistance of France and England, that the United Provinces supported themselves: which teaches us, that if the visionary danger of independence in our colonies is to be feared, nothing is more likely to render it substantial than the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with the sovereign government, capable of giving either aid or an asylum, as the event shall require. Yet against even these disadvantages, did Spain preserve almost ten provinces, merely thro’ their want of union, which indeed could never have taken place among the others, but for causes, some of which are in our case impossible, and others it is impious to suppose possible.  
The Romans well understood that policy which teaches the security arising to the chief government from separate states among the governed, when they restored the liberties of the states of Greece, (oppressed but united under Macedon,) by an edict that every state should live under its own laws.  
*Omnes Graecorum civitates, quae in Europa, quaeque in Asia essent, libertatem ac suas leges haberent, &amp;c.Liv. lib. 33. c. 30.  
They did not even name a governor. Independence of each other, and separate interests, tho’ among a people united by common manners, language, and I may say religion, inferior neither in wisdom, bravery, nor their love of liberty, to the Romans themselves, was all the security the sovereigns wished for their sovereignty. It is true, they did not call themselves sovereigns; they set no value on the title; they were contented with possessing the thing; and possess it they did, even without a standing army. What can be a stronger proof of the security of their possession? And yet by a policy similar to this throughout, was the Roman world subdued and held: a world compos’d of above an hundred languages and sets of manners different from those of their masters.

.  
But what is the prudent policy inculcated by the remarker, to obtain this end, security of dominion over our colonies: It is, to leave the French in Canada, to “check” their growth, for otherwise our people may “increase infinitely from all causes.”  
†Remarks, p. 50, 51.  
We have already seen in what manner the French and their Indians check the growth of our colonies. ’Tis a modest word, this, check, for massacring men, women and children. The writer would, if he could, hide from himself as well as from the public, the horror arising from such a proposal, by couching it in general terms: ’tis no wonder he thought it a “subject not fit for discussion” in his letter, tho’ he recommends it as “a point that should be the constant object of the minister’s attention!” But if Canada is restored on this principle, will not Britain be guilty of all the blood to be shed, all the murders to be committed in order to check this dreaded growth of our own people? Will not this be telling the French in plain terms, that the horrid barbarities they perpetrate with their Indians on our colonists, are agreeable to us; and that they need not apprehend the resentment of a government with whose views they so happily concur? Will not the colonies view it in this light? Will they have reason to consider themselves any longer as subjects and children, when they find their cruel enemies halloo’d upon them by the country from whence they sprung, the government that owes them protection as it requires their obedience? Is not this the most likely means of driving them into the arms of the French, who can invite them by an offer of that security their own government chuses not to afford them? I would not be thought to insinuate that the remarker wants humanity. I know how little many good-natured persons are affected by the distresses of people at a distance and whom they do not know. There are even those, who, being present, can sympathize sincerely with the grief of a lady on the sudden death of her favourite bird, and yet can read of the sinking of a city in Syria with very little concern. If it be, after all, thought necessary to check the growth of our colonies, give me leave to propose a method less cruel. It is a method of which we have an example in scripture. The murder of husbands, of wives, of brothers, sisters, and children whose pleasing society has been for some time enjoyed, affects deeply the respective surviving relations: but grief for the death of a child just born is short and easily supported. The method I mean is that which was dictated by the Egyptian policy, when the “infinite increase” of the children of Israel was apprehended as dangerous to the state.  
*And Pharoah said unto his people, behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we; come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply; and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. … And the king spake to the Hebrew midwives, &amp;c.Exodus, Chap. 1.  
Let an act of parliament, [then] be made, enjoining the colony midwives to stifle in the birth every third or fourth child. By this means you may keep the colonies to their present size. And if they were under the hard alternative of submitting to one or the other of these schemes for checking their growth, I dare answer for them, they would prefer the latter.  
But all this debate about the propriety or impropriety of keeping or restoring Canada, is possibly too early. We have taken the capital indeed, but the country is yet far from being in our possession; and perhaps never will be: for if our M——rs are persuaded by such counsellors as the remarker, that the French there are “not the worst of neighbours,” and that if we had conquered Canada, we ought for our own sakes to restore it, as a check to the growth of our colonies, I am then afraid we shall never take it. For there are many ways of avoiding the completion of the conquest, that will be less exceptionable and less odious than the giving it up.  
The objection I have often heard, that if we had Canada, we could not people it, without draining Britain of its inhabitants, is founded on ignorance of the nature of population in new countries. When we first began to colonize in America, it was necessary to send people, and to send seed-corn; but it is not now necessary that we should furnish, for a new colony, either one or the other. The annual increment alone of our present colonies, without diminishing their numbers, or requiring a man from hence, is sufficient in ten years to fill Canada with double the number of English that it now has of French inhabitants.  
*In fact, there has not gone from Britain to our colonies these 20 years past, to settle there, so many as 10 families a year; the new settlers are either the offspring of the old, or emigrants from Germany or the north of Ireland.  
Those who are protestants among the French, will probably chuse to remain under the English government; many will chuse to remove if they can be allowed to sell their lands improvements and effects: the rest in that thin-settled country, will in less than half a century, from the crowds of English settling round and among them, be blended and incorporated with our people both in language and manners.  
In Guadalupe the case is somewhat different; and though I am far from thinking

‡It is often said we have plenty of sugar-land still unemployed in Jamaica: but those who are well acquainted with that island, know, that the remaining vacant land in it is generally situated among mountains, rocks and gullies, that make carriage impracticable, so that no profitable use can be made of it, unless the price of sugars should so greatly increase as to enable the planter to make very expensive roads, by blowing up rocks, erecting bridges, &amp;c. every 2 or 300 yards.

I cannot think Guadalupe is so desirable an increase of it, as other objects the enemy would probably be infinitely more ready to part with. A country fully inhabited by any nation is no proper possession for another of different language, manners and religion. It is hardly ever tenable at less expence than it is worth. But the isle of Cayenne, and its appendix Equinoctial-France, would indeed be an acquisition every way suitable to our situation and desires. This would hold all that migrate from Barbadoes, the Leward-Islands, or Jamaica. It would certainly recal into an English government (in which there would be room for millions) all who have before settled or purchased in Martinico, Guadalupe, Santa-Cruz or St. John’s; except such as know not the value of an English government, and such I am sure are not worth recalling.  
But should we keep Guadalupe, we are told it would enable us to export £300,000 in sugars. Admit it to be true, though perhaps the amazing increase of English consumption might stop most of it here, to whose profit is this to redound? to the profit of the French inhabitants of the island: except a small part that should fall to the share of the English purchasers, but whose whole purchase-money must first be added to the wealth and circulation of France.  
I grant, however, much of this £300,000 would be expended in British manufactures. Perhaps, too, a few of the land-owners of Guadalupe might dwell and spend their fortunes in Britain, (though probably much fewer than of the inhabitants of North America). I admit the advantage arising to us from these circumstances, (as far as they go) in the case of Guadalupe, as well as in that of our other West India settlements. Yet even this consumption is little better than that of an allied nation would be, who should take our manufactures and supply us with sugar, and put us to no expence in defending the place of growth.  
But though our own colonies expend among us almost the whole produce of our sugar,  
*Remarks, p. 47.  
can we or ought we to promise ourselves this will be the case of Guadalupe. One £100,000 will supply them with British manufactures; and supposing we can effectually prevent the introduction of those of France, (which is morally impossible in a country used to them) the other 200,000 will still be spent in France, in the education of their children and support of themselves; or else be laid up there, where they will always think their home to be.

ation. It would be a very long and a very disagreeable one, to run thro’ every thing material on this head. It is enough to our present point, if I have shown, that the value of North America is capable of an immense increase, by an acquisition and measures, that must necessarily have an effect the direct contrary of what we have been industriously taught to fear; and that Guadalupe is, in point of advantage, but a very small addition to our West India possessions, rendered many ways less valuable to us than it is to the French, who will probably set more value upon it than upon a country that is much more valuable to us than to them.  
There is a great deal more to be said on all the parts of these subjects; but as it would carry me into a detail that I fear would tire the pati

would be a real advantage to us, ye  
may demand it, under the Remarkér;  
hand, as.an indemnification for the  
charges incurred in recovering our jul  
rights; otherwife, according to his  
own principles, the demand of Guada-  
loupe can have no foundation.  
Remarks, Ove claims before the

and for fecurity too. ri  
Anfwer. Wedid.not make thofe  
claims becaufe.they were large enough  
for fecurity,: but. becaufe we cottld  
rightfully claim no more. Advanta-  
ges gained in the courfe of this war,  
may increafe the extent of our rights,  
The demand of Canada is founded  
on the little value of it to the French ;  
the right we have to afk, and the power  
  
we may have to infift on an imdemni-  
  
fication for our expences ; the difficul-  
ty the French themfelves will be under  
of reftraining their reftlefs fubjects in  
America .from ehcroaching on our Ji-  
mits, and difturbing our trade; and  
the difficulty on our parts of prevent-.  
ing encroachmeuts that may poflibly  
exift many years, without coming to  
our knowledge.  
  
_ Remarks. 1 do not fee why the ar-  
guments employed concerning a fecu-  
rity for a peaceable behaviour in Ca-  
nada, would not be equally cogent for  
  
calling for the fame fecurity in Eu \
  
rope. . . |  
  
_Anfwer. The circumftances of the  
two cafes ate widely different. Here  
any attempt to encroach upon us, by  
building a fort, even in the obfcurelt  
corner of thefe iflands, muft be knowe  
and prevented immediately. The ag-  
grellors alfo muft be known. In A-  
merica it is quite otherwife. A valt  
wildernefs, thinly, or farce at all peo-  
pled, conceals the march of the troops  
and workmen. Dear experience has  
taught us this. But what is {till worle,  
the wide extended forelts between our  
fettlements and theirs, are inhabited  
by barbarous tribes of favages, [trong  
ly attach’d to the French by the art  
and indefatigable indultry of prielts,

family alliances. Thefe are eafily, and  
have been continually inftigated to  
maflacre our planters, even in times of  
full peace between the two crowns.  
And tho’ they are fupplied by the  
French, and carry their prifaners to  
them, we cau by complaining obtain no  
redrefs, as the governors of Canada  
have a ready excufe, that the Indians  
srean independent people, over whom  
they have no power.  
  
Remarks. We fhall be fufficiently  
fecure in America, if we raife Englifh  
forts at fuch pafles at may at once  
make us refpectable to the French and  
to the Indian nations,  
  
Anfwer. The fecurity defirable in  
America may be confidered as of three  
kinds; 1. A fecurity of poffeffion, that  
the French fhall not drive us out of  
the country. 2. A fecurity of our  
planters from the inroads of favages,  
and the murders committed by them.  
3. A fecurity that the Britifh nation  
fhall not be obliged on every new war  
to répeat the immenfe expence occafi-  
oned by this, to defend its poffeffions  
in America, Forts in the moft impor-  
tant pafies, may be of ofe to obtain  
the firft kind of fecurity : But as thofe  
fituations are far advanced beyond the  
inhabitants, the expence of maintain-  
ing and fupplying the garrifons will be  
very great even in time of full peace,  
and immenfe on every interruption of  
It; as it is eafy for fkulking parties of  
the enemy in fuch long roads through

the third kind of fecurity, that we thall  
not, in a few years, have all we have  
now done to do over again in Ameri-

doubted the French, who are adroit at

fubduing and retaining Canada. Our

there is no doubt of their being ai-

common juftice, to live in perpetual

Anfwer, Itisa great miftake to i-  
  
magine that the American country in  
que(tion between Great-Britain and  
¥rance, is claimed as the property of  
any individuals or public body in A-  
merica, or that the poffeflion of it by  
Great-Britain, is likely, in any lucra-  
tive view, to redound at all to the ad-  
vantage of any perfon there. The bulk  
of the inhabitants of North-America  
are land-owners, whofe lands are in-  
ferior in value to thofe of Britain, only  
by the want of an equal number of  
people. It is true the acceflion of the  
large territory claimed before the war  
began, efpecially if that be fecured by  
the poffeflion of Canada, will tend to  
the increafe of the Britifh fubjects fa-  
{ter than if they had been confin’d  
within the mountains: yetthe increafe  
Within the mountains only would evi-  
dently make the corhparative popula-  
tion equal to that of Great-Britain  
much fooner, than it can be expected  
when our people are fpread over a  
country fix times as large. No con-  
fiderable advantage has refulted to the  
colonies by the conquelts of this war,  
or can refuli from confirming them by  
the peace, but what they mult enjoy in  
common with the reft of the Britith  
people ; with this evident drawback  
from their fore of thefe advantages,  
that they wil! neceffarily leflen, or at  
leait prevent the increafe of, the value  
of what mskes the principal part of  
their private property. A people  
{pread thro’ the whole tra&amp; of coun-  
try on this fide the Miffflippi, and fecu-  
red by Canada in our hands, would  
probably by fome centuries find em-  
ployment in agriculture, and thereb  
  
sree us at home effe@ually from our  
tears of Americas manutactures. Un-

Anfwer. The very reafon the Re-  
marker afigns for their fo extending,  
and which is indeed the true one, their  
“being invited to it by the pleafant-  
nefs, fertility, and plenty of the coun-  
try,” may fatisfy us, that this exten-  
fion will continue to proceed as long as  
there remains any pleafant fertile coun-  
try within their reach. And if we e-  
ven fuppofe them confined by the wa-  
ters of the Miffifippi weltward, and by  
thofe of St Laurence and the Lakes  
to the northward, yet ftill we fhall  
leave them room enough to increafe  
even in the /parfe manner of feitling  
now practis’d there, till they amount  
to perhaps one hundred millions of  
foul. This muft take fome centuries  
to fulfil, and in the mean time, this  
nation mutt neceffarily fupply them with  
the manufactures they confume, becaufe  
the new fettlers will be employ’d in a-  
griculture, and the new fettlyments  
will fo continually draw off the fpare  
hands from the old, that our prefent  
colonies will not, during the period we  
have mentioned, find themfelves in a  
condition to manuf:cture even for their  
own inhabitants, to any confiderable  
degree, much iefs for thofe who are  
fettling behind them. Thus our trade  
mutt, till that country becomes as fully  
peopled as England, that is for centu-  
  
&quot; Fles to come, be continually increafing,  
  
and with it our naval power; becaufe  
the ocean is between us and them, and  
our fhips and feamen mutt increafe as  
  
that trade increales.  
bet fay the objectors, “ There isa  
  
certain diltance from the fea, in Ame-  
  
  
  
  
a 1760, 259  
  
rica, beyond which the expence of car-  
riage will put a ftop to the fale and  
confumption of your .manofa@ures ;  
and this, with the difliculty of making  
returns for them, will oblige the inha-  
bitants to manufacture for themfelves ;  
of courfe, if you fuffer your people to  
extend their fe:tlements beyond that  
diftance, your people become ulelefs to  
you ;” and this diftance is limited by  
fome to 200 miles, by others to the  
Apalachian mountains, . . I fhall en-  
deavour to fhow that thefe imaginary  
limits of utility, even in point of com-  
merce, are much too narrow.  
  
The inland parts of the continent of  
Europe are much farther from the fea  
than the limits of fettlement propoled  
America. Germany is full of tradef-  
men and artificers of all kinds; yet  
it is q well-known fad, that our ma-  
nufaGurers find their way even into  
the heart ofthat country. Ifthefe na-  
tions, over whom we have no govern-  
ment, over whofe confumption we can  
have no influence, but what arifes  
from the cheapnefs and goodnefs of our  
wares; whofe trade, manufadtures, or  
commercial connections, are not fubject  
to the controul of our laws, as thofe  
of our colonies certainly are in fome  
degree: I fay, if thefe nations pur-  
chafe and confume fuch quantities of  
our goods, notwithftanding the remore-  
nefs of their fituation from the fea ;  
how much Jefs likely is it that the fet-  
tlers in America, who mult for apes be  
employed in agriculture chiefly, fhould  
make cheaper for themfelves the goods  
our manufacturers at prefent fupply  
  
them with ; even if we fuppofe thecar-  
riage five, fix, or fevyen hundred miles  
from the fea, as dificult and expenfive  
as the like diltance into Germany  
whereas in the latter, the natural dj-  
ftances are frequently doubled by po-  
litical obftructions, I mean the inter-  
mixed territories and clafhing interefts  
of princes. But when we confider

If the growths of a country find

Several attempts bave been made in

from Britain, it only enables them the  
better to pay for finer goods that other.  
wife they could not indulge themfelves  
in: So that the exports thither are  
not diminifhed by fuch manufacture,  
but rather increafed. The fimple ar-  
ticle of manufaéture in thefe colonies  
mentioned by the remarker, is hats  
made in New-England. It is true  
there have been ever fince the firft fet-  
tlement of that country, a few hatters  
there, drawa thither probably at firlt  
by the facility of getting beaver, while  
the woods were but little cleared, and  
there was plenty of thofe animals, The  
cafe is greatly altered now. The bea-  
ver fkins are not now to be had in  
New-England, but from very remote  
places and at great prices. The trade  
is accordingly declining there; fo that,  
far from being able to make hats in a-  
ny quantity for exportation, they can-  
not fupply their home demand. In  
fact, the colonies are fo little fuited for  
e(tablithing manufactures, that they are  
continually lofing the few branches  
they accidentally pain, The work-  
  
ing brafiers, cutlers, and pewterers, 35  
well as hatters, who have happened ta

Thus much as to the apprehenfion  
of our colonies becoming u/ele/s tous.  
 fhall next confider the other fuppofi-  
  
Htion, that their growth may render  
  
them dangerous. Of this I own, I  
have not the leaft conception, when I  
confider that we have already fourteen  
feparate governments On the maritime  
coalt of the continent, and if we ex-  
tend our fettlements, fhall probably  
have asmany more behind them on  
the inland fide. ‘Thofe we now have,  
are not dnly under different governors,  
but have different forms of govern-  
ment, different laws, different interelts,  
and fome of them different religious  
perfuafions, and different manners.  
Their jealoufy of each othet is fo  
graet, that however néceflary an union  
of the colonies has long been, for their  
common defence and fecurity againft  
their enemies, and how fenfible foever  
tach colony has been of that neceflity,  
yet they have never been able to effect  
fuch an union among themifelves, hor  
even to agrée in requefting the mothet  
country to eftablifh it for them. No-  
thing but the immediate command of  
the crown has been able to ptoduce e-  
ven the imperfe anion but lately feeri  
there, of the forces of fome colonies.  
The objection I have-often heard,  
that if we had Canada, we could not

who are Proteftantsamong the French,  
will probably chufe to remain under

the generabion of the sons of Israel  
that went to Egypt were all dead ; and  
another King now reigned, who knew not  
Joseph, or rather did nob care to know  
him, or think of what he had done for  
the Egyptians. This King thought himself  
an extraordinary smart fellow, and in  
his wisdom, he thought he would change  
the position and prospects of the  
children of Israel, who, from their  
industry and virtue at this time, had  
become not only numerous but wealthy.  
Now what did this new King do ? He said  
to hi3 people : — &#x27;Come, let us deal  
wisely with them, lest they multiply,  
and it come to pass when there falleth  
out any war, they join also unto onr  
enemies, and fight against us, and so  
get them up out of the laud.&#x27; From this  
time until the flight of the Children of  
Israel, we know they were treated as  
slaves. So far as the Children of Israel  
being treated badly in Egypt ; their  
cose is not so bad as that of the Irish  
people, for Egypt was not their home,  
the country did not belong to them ; in  
this particular the sufferings of the  
Irish people were much harder to endure,  
for in their case they were persecuted  
in their own land, under their own^ roof  
tree, by the proud and tyrannic invader

These political relations are thoroughly treated in my  
“Through Goshen to Sinai.” It is only necessary to say  
in this connection that the Semitic inhabitants of the  
delta must have been kept in stern subjection by the  
father and grandfather of the Pharaoh of the exodus,  
Seti I. arid Rameses II.; for both of these kings lived in  
continual warfare with the peoples of Asia, and among their  
enemies, besides the great nation of the Kheta were large  
numbers of Semitic chieftains and princes. In view of  
these facts, the Bible statement, ‘‘ Lest it come to pass that  
when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves  
unto our enemies” (Exod. 1: 10), becomes full of signifi-

founded in poverty. It is the multitude of poor without land

starve, that enable undertakers to carry on a manufacture,  
and afford it cheap enough to prevent the importation of the  
same kind from abroad, and to bear the expense of its own  
exportation.”” He contends that the North American col-

they must be defended by the Empire for that reason, and

the colonies, and the failure of all attempts hitherto made to

their defense against the French and Indians, who were per-

there is any danger of their uniting against their own nation,  
which protects and encourages them, with which they have  
many connections and ties of blood, interest, and affection,

oneanother?”’ And yet Franklin was careful to leave an open  
door through which he could have escaped the charge of in-  
consistency if such charge had been preferred a dozen years  
later. ‘‘ When I say such a union is impossible, I mean with-

“raving ” to this effect. The argument is quite inconsist-  
ent with,what we have already learnt as to the decay of  
the fur trade in the English colonies. And the truer im-  
pression is certainly that which Franklin himself gives  
in his pamphlet of 1760, before cited, that the hat-making  
industry had been brought to an end not by the pressure  
of law, but by economic causes.  
  
It is true [Franklin then said] there have been, ever since the first  
settlement, a few hatters in New England, drawn thither probably at  
first by the facility of getting beaver while the woods were but little  
cleared and there was plenty of those animals. The case is greatly  
altered now. The beaver skins are not now to be had in New Eng-  
land, but from very remote places and at great prices. The trade is  
accordingly declining there; so that, far from being able to make hats  
in any quantity for exportation, they cannot supply their home  
demand; and it is well known that some thousand dozens are sent  
thither yearly from London, Bristol, and Liverpool, and sold cheaper  
than the inhabitants can make them.
