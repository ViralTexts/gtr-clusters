y received it in that form from the author. Three years later the identical text appeared in a collection of Franklin’s writings under the new title, “Observations on War.” In 1806, a new collection of Franklin’s works reprinted the same text and title, indicating that it was reprinted from the American Museum. William Temple Franklin followed suit, placing the “Observations on War” in the final volume of his edition under the section entitled “General Politics and Commerce.” Elsewhere in that same section, Temple published as an independent item “A Thought Concerning the Sugar Islands.”  
  
[after July 10, 1782]  
I.  
It is for the Interest of Humanity in general, that the Occasions of War, and the Inducements to it, should be diminished.  
If Rapine is abolished, one of the Encouragements to War is taken away, and Peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting.  
The Practice of Robbing Merchants on the high Seas, a Remnant of the Ancient Piracy, tho’ it may be accidentally beneficial to particular Persons, is far from being profitable to all engaged in it, or to the Nation that authorizes it. In the Beginning of a War some rich Ships, not upon their Guard, are surprized and taken. This encourages the first Adventurers to fit out more arm’d Vessels, and many others to do the same. But the Enemy, at the same time, become more careful, arm their Merchant Ships better, and render them not so easy to be taken; they go also more under the Protection of Convoys, thus while the Privateers to take them are multiplied, the Vessels subject to be taken, and the Chances of Profit are diminished; so that many Cruises are made wherein the Expences overgo the Gains; and as is the Case in other Lotteries, tho’ particulars have got Prizes, the mass of Adventurers are Losers, the whole Expence of fitting out all the Privateers during a War, being much greater than the whole Amount of Goods taken. Then there is the National Loss of all the Labour of so many Men during the time they have been employed in Robbing; who, besides, spend what they get in Riot, Drunkenness and Debauchery, lose their Habits of Industry, are rarely fit for any Sober Business after a Peace, and serve only to encrease the Number of Highwaymen &amp; House Breakers. Even the Undertakers, who have been fortunate, are, by sudden Wealth, led into expensive living, the Habit of which continues when the means of supporting it cease, and finally ruins them. A Just Punishment of their having wantonly &amp; unfeelingly ruined many honest innocent Traders and their Families, whose Substance was employed in serving the common Interest of Mankind.  
  
II.  
Should it be agreed, &amp; become a Part of the Law of Nations, that the Cultivators of the Earth are not to be molested or interrupted in their Peaceable and useful Employment, the Inhabitants of the Sugar Islands would perhaps come under the Protection of such a Regulation, which would be a great Advantage to the Nations who at present hold those Islands, since the Cost of Sugar to the Consumer in those Nations, consists not only in the Price he pays for it by the Pound, but in the accumulated Charge of all the Taxes he pays in every War to fit out Fleets and maintain Troops for the Defence of the Islands that raise the Sugar and the Ships that bring it home. But the Expence of Treasure is not all. A celebrated Philosophical Writer remarks, that when he consider’d the Wars made in Africa for Prisoners to raise Sugar in America, the Numbers slain in those Wars, the Number that being crowded in Ships perish in the Transportation, &amp; the Numbers that die under the Severities of Slavery, he could scarce look on a Morsel of Sugar without conceiving it spotted with Human Blood. If he had consider’d also the Blood of one another which the white Nations shed in fighting for those Islands, he would have imagined his Sugar not as spotted only, but as thoroughly died red.— On these Accounts I am persuaded that the Subjects of the Emperor of Germany and the Empress of Russia, who have no Sugar Islands, consume Sugar cheaper at Vienna and Moscow, with all the Charge of transporting it after its Arrival in Europe, than the Citizens of London or of Paris. And I sincerely believe that if France &amp; England were to decide by throwing Dice which should have the whole of their Sugar Islands, the Loser in the Throw would be the Gainer. The future Expence of defending them would be saved; the Sugars would be bought cheaper by all Europe if the Inhabitants might make it without Interruption, and whoever imported the Sugar, the same Revenue might be raised by Duties at the Custom Houses of the Nation that consumed it. And on the whole I conceive it would be better for the Nations now possessing Sugar Colonies to give up their Claim to them, let them govern themselves, and put them under the Protection of all the Powers of Europe as neutral Countries open to the Commerce of all, the Profits of the present Monopoly’s being by no means equivalent to the Expence of maintaining them.

and the King of Prussia.—His argument against privateer-  
ing has been long before the world; but, as the fact does not  
seem to be known, we shall venture to lay it before them  
again. If there is any weight in Dr. Smith’s argument against  
lotteries, we think our readers must acknowledge the force of  
Dr. Franklin’s analogous reasoning about privateers.  
  
‘ The practice of robbing merchants on the high seas, a rem-

nations, which have sugar-islands subject to their dominion,  
would be more benefited by the loss than they are by the pos-  
session; for, as he observes, ‘the cost of sugar to the con-  
sumer in those nations consists not merely in the price he pays  
for it by the pound, .but in the accumulated charge of all the  
taxes he pays in every war to fit out fleets and maintain troops  
for the defence of the islands that raise the sugar, and the  
ships that bring it home.’ (P. 421.) He expresses his conviction  
that sugar actually costs the consumer less at Vienna or Moscow,  
where the sovereigns have no sugar-islands, than it costs the  
citizens of London or Paris, though they are exempted from  
the charges of transport after the arrival of the commodity in  
their ports : )  
  
¢ And I sincerely believe,’ says he, ‘ that if France and England  
were to decide by throwing dice which should have the whole of  
their susan adesibe; the loser in the throw would be the gainer.  
The future expence of defending them would be saved; the sugars  
would be bought cheaper by all Europe if the inhabitants might  
make it without interruption, and whoever imported the sugar, the  
same revenue might be‘raised by duties at the custom-houses of  
the nation that consumed it. And on the whole I conceive it  
would be better for the nations now possessing sugar-colonies to  
give up their claim to them, let them govern themselves, and put  
them under the protection of all the powers of Europe as neutral  
countries, open to the commerce of all, the profits of the present  
monopolies being by no means equivalent to the expence of main-  
taining them.’

all engaged in it, or to the nation that au-

breakers. Even the undertakers who have  
been fortunate, are by sudden wealth led into  
expensive living, the habit of which continues  
when the means of supporting it ceases, and

“ Should it be agreed, and become a part of  
the law of nations, that the cultivators of the  
earth are not to be molested or interrupted in  
their peaceable and useful employments, the in-  
habitants of the sugar islands would perhaps  
come under the protection of such a regulation ;  
which would be a great advantage to the nations  
who at present hold those islands, since the cost  
of sugar to the consumer in those nations con-  
sists not merely in the price he pays for it by  
the pound, but in the accumulated charge of all  
the taxes he pays, in every war, to fit out fleets  
and maintain troops for the defence of the  
islands that raise the sugar, and the ships that  
bring it home. But the expense of treasure is  
not all. A celebrated philosophical writer re-  
marks, that, when he considered the wars made  
in Africa for prisoners to raise sugar in Ame-  
rica, the numbers slain in those wars, the num-  
bers that, being crowded in ships, perish in the  
transportation, and the numbers that die under  
the severities of slavery, he could scarce look  
on a morsel of sugar without conceiving it spot-  
ted with human blood. If he had considered also  
the blood of one another which the white na-  
tions shed in fighting for those islands, he would  
have imaginal his sugar, not as spotted only,  
  
but as thoroughly dyed red ! On these accounts,  
  
have no sugar islands, consume sugar cheaper  
at Vienna and Moscow, with all the charge of  
transporting it after its arrival in Europe, than  
  
|| the citizens of London or of Paris: gnd I sin-  
  
cerely believe that, if France and England were  
to decide by throwing dice which should have  
the whole of their sugar islands, the loser of the  
throw would be the gainer. The future expense  
of defending them would be saved; the su-  
gars would be bought cheaper by all Europe, if  
the inhabitants might make it without interrup-  
tion; and, whoever imported the sugar, the  
same revenue might be raised by the duties at  
the custom-houses of the nation that consumed  
it. And, on the whole, I conceive it would be  
better for the nations now possessing sugar co-  
lonies, to give up their claim to them; let them  
govern themselves, and put them under the  
protection of all the powers of Europe, as neu-  
tral countries open to the commerce of all ; the  
profits of the present monopolies being by no  
means equivalent to the expense of maintaining  
them.”

doubtful if not disreputable  
profession. : A strong opposition to  
privateering was made by FRANKLIN and  
his coadjutors at the close of the war  
of independence, and reasons assigned  
such as it is extremely difficult to  
answer, but which unfertunately have no  
prac-tical power against the temporary  
advantage found in privateers, by which  
nations are enabled to raise a force  
without taxation, and to divert, it they  
cannot effectually meet, the war ships  
of the enemy. The following are the  
words of FRANKLIN addressed to Mr.  
OSWALD, the British Minister, in the  
negotiations for the peace of 1783 : &quot;  
It is for the interest of humanity in  
general that the occasions of war and  
the inducements to it should be  
diminished. If rapine is abo-lished, one  
of the encouragements of war is taken  
away, and peace, therefore, more likely  
to continue and be lasting. The practice  
of robbing merchants on the high seas-a  
remnant of the ancient piracy-though it  
may be acci-dentally beneficial to  
particular persons, is far from being  
profitable to all engaged in it, or to  
tho nation that authorises it. In the  
beginning of a war, some rich skips, not  
upon their guard, are surprised and  
taken. This encourages the first  
adventurers to fit out more armed  
vessels, and many others to do the same.  
But the enemy, at the samo time, becomes  
more careful -arm their merchant ships  
better, and render them not so easy to  
be taken ; they go also more under the  
protection of convoys. Thus, while the  
privateers to take them are multiplied,  
the vessels subject to be taken and the  
chances of profit are diminished, so  
that many cruizes are made, wherein the  
expenses overg&gt; the gains, and, as is  
the case in other lotteries, though some  
have good prizes, the mass of  
adventurers are losers; the whole  
expense of fitting out all privateers,  
during a war, being much greater than  
the whole amount of goods taken. Then  
there is the national loss of all the  
labour of so many men during the timo  
they have been employed in robbing, who,  
besides spending what they get in riot,  
drunkenness, and dé-baucher}&#x27;, lose  
their habits of industry, are rarely fit  
for any sober business after peace, and  
serve only to increase the number of  
high-waymen and housebreakers. Even the  
under-takers, who have been fortunate,  
are, by sudden wealth, led into  
expensive living, the habit of which  
continues when the means of supporting  
it cease, and finally ruins them; a just  
punish-ment for their having wantonly  
and unfeelingly ruined many honest,  
innocent traders and families, whose  
subsistence was obtained in serving the  
common interests of mankind.&quot; NOTE.-Th
