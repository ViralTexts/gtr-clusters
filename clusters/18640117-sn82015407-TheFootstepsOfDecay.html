<br/>
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—<br/>
Arounds its senses and awake<br/>
To see how soon<br/>
Life, in its glories, glides away,<br/>
And the stern footsteps of decay<br/>
Come stealing on.<br/>
<br/>
And while we view the rolling tide,<br/>
Down which our flowing minutes glide<br/>
Away so fast,<br/>
Let us the present hour employ,<br/>
And deem each future dream a joy<br/>
Already past.<br/>
<br/>
Let no vain hope deceive the mind—<br/>
No happier let us hope to find<br/>
Tomorrow, than to-day.<br/>
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,<br/>
Like them the present shall delight—<br/>
Like them decay.<br/>
<br/>
Our lives like hasting streams must be,<br/>
That into one engulphing sea<br/>
Are doomed to fall—<br/>
The sea of Death, whose waves roll on<br/>
O&#x27;er king and kingdom, crown and throne,<br/>
And swallow all.<br/>
<br/>
Alike the river&#x27;s lordly tide,<br/>
Alike the humble rivulet&#x27;s glide<br/>
To that sad wave;<br/>
Death levels poverty and pride—<br/>
The rich and poor sleep side by side<br/>
Within the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Our birth is but a starting place;<br/>
Life is the running of the race,<br/>
And death the goal:<br/>
There all our glittering toys are brought—<br/>
That path alone, of all unsought,<br/>
Is found of all.<br/>
<br/>
See, then, how poor and little worth<br/>
Are all those glittering toys of earth<br/>
That lure us here!<br/>
Dreams of a sleep that death must break,<br/>
Alas! before it bids us wake,<br/>
We disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Long ere the damp of earth can blight,<br/>
The cheek&#x27;s pure glow of red and white<br/>
Has passed away:<br/>
Youth smiled, and all was heavenly fair—<br/>
Age came and laid his finger there,<br/>
And where are they?<br/>
<br/>
Where is the strength that spurned decay,<br/>
The steps that roved so light and gay,<br/>
The heart&#x27;s blithe tone?<br/>
The strength is gone, the step is slow,<br/>
And joy grows wearisome, and wo!<br/>
When age comes on!<br/>

<br/>
THE FOOTSTEPS OF DEOAY.<br/>
<br/>
O! let the soul its slumbers break—<br/>
Arouse its senses and awake<br/>
To see how soon<br/>
Life, in its glories, glides away,<br/>
And the stern footsteps OI decay<br/>
Come stealing on.<br/>
<br/>
And while we view the rolling tide,<br/>
<br/>
Down which our flowing minutes glide<br/>
Away so fast,<br/>
<br/>
Let us the present hour employ,<br/>
<br/>
And deem each future dream a joy<br/>
Already past.<br/>
<br/>
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,<br/>
<br/>
No happier let us hope to find<br/>
To-morrow than to day;<br/>
<br/>
Our golden dreams of yore were bright,<br/>
<br/>
Like them the present shall delight—<br/>
Like them decay.<br/>
<br/>
Our lives like hastening streams must be,<br/>
That into one engulfing sea<br/>
Are doomed to fall—<br/>
The sea of death, whose waves roll on<br/>
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,<br/>
And swallow all.<br/>
<br/>
Alike the river’s lordly tide,<br/>
<br/>
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,<br/>
To that sad wave!<br/>
<br/>
Death levels poverty and pride,<br/>
<br/>
Apvd rich and poor sleep side by side,<br/>
Within the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Our birth is but a starting-place ;<br/>
Life is the running of the race,<br/>
And death the goal;<br/>
There all our glittering toys are brouglt—<br/>
That path alone, of all unsought,<br/>
Is found of all.<br/>
<br/>
See, then, how poor and little worth<br/>
Are all those glittering toys of earth<br/>
That lure us here;<br/>
Dreams of a sleep that death must break’<br/>
Alas! before it bids us wake,<br/>
We disappear.<br/>
Long ere the damp of death can blig&#x27;t,<br/>
The cheek’s pure glow of red and wilte<br/>
Ilas passed away;<br/>
Youth smiled. and all was heaveny fair—<br/>
Age came, and laid his finger the,<br/>
And where are they?<br/>
Where is the strength that sparned decay,<br/>
The step that roved su light #d gay,<br/>
The heart’s blithe tone?<br/>
The strength is gone, the s/ep is slow,<br/>
And joy grows wearisonr, and woe!<br/>

FROM THE SPANISH.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! let the soul its slumbers break—<br/>
Arouse its senses, and awake<br/>
To see how soon<br/>
Life, in all its glories, glides away,<br/>
And the stern footsteps of decay<br/>
Come stealing on.<br/>
<br/>
And while we view the rolling tide<br/>

Down which our flowing minutes glide<br/>
Away s0 fast,<br/>

Let us the present hour employ,<br/>

And deem each future dream a joy<br/>
Already past.<br/>
<br/>
Let no vain hope deceive the mind,<br/>
No happier lot let us find<br/>
To-morrow than to-day.<br/>
Our golden dreams of yore were bright—<br/>
Like them the present shall delight—<br/>
Like them decay.<br/>
Our lives like hastening streams must be,<br/>
That into ono engulfing sea<br/>
Are doomed to fall—<br/>
The sea of death, whose waves roll on<br/>
O’er king and kingdom, crown and throne,<br/>
And swallow all.<br/>
<br/>
Alike the river’s lordly tide,<br/>
Alike the humble rivulet’s glide,<br/>
To that sad wave!<br/>
Death levels poverty and pride,<br/>
And rich and poor sleep side by side<br/>
Within the grave.<br/>
Our birth is but a starting place,<br/>
Life is the running of the race,<br/>
And death the goal;<br/>
