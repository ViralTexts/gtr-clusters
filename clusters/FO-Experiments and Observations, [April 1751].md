t the Experiments were in press; by February everything was ready except the engraved illustrations. The delay, however, gave Franklin time to make some additions and corrections and to send Collinson still another group of observations to include in the work. The pamphlet finally appeared in April 1751. It was entitled Experiments and Observations on Electricity, made at Philadelphia in America, and sold for 2s. 6d.  
Enclosing an unfinished copy to a rural physician in Dorset in March, Dr. Fothergill explained that the author was “a Gentleman with whom I have corresponded, and who I think has said more sensible things on the subject, and let us see more into the nature of this delicate affair than all the other writers put together; … This little work … was published under my care, and so far as related to the press, my correction.” Joseph Priestley, reviewing the history of electricity fifteen years later, asserted unequivocally, “Nothing was ever written upon the subject of electricity which was more generally read, and admired in all parts of Europe than these letters. There is hardly any European language into which they have not been translated; and, as if this were not sufficient to make them properly known, a translation of them has lately been made into Latin. It is not easy to say, whether we are most pleased with the simplicity and perspicuity with which these letters are written, the modesty with which the author proposes every hypothesis of his own, or the noble frankness with which he relates his mistakes, when they were corrected by subsequent experiments.”  
  
Fothergill’s “pretty preface,” as Collinson called it, is printed herewith, and below it is a list of the contents of the 1751 edition. The title of each paper is followed in brackets by the pages in Volume iii or iv of the present edition where the text is reprinted, together with any other information required to correct or supplement the heading as first printed. The plate of illustrations included in the 1751 edition is reproduced, facing p. 130.  
  
The Preface.  
It may be necessary to acquaint the reader, that the following observations and experiments were not drawn up with a view to their being made publick, but were communicated at different times, and most of them in letters wrote on various topicks, as matters only of private amusement.  
But some persons to whom they were read, and who had themselves been conversant in electrical disquisitions, were of opinion, they contain’d so many curious and interesting particulars relative to this affair, that it would be doing a kind of injustice to the publick, to confine them solely to the limits of a private acquaintance.  
The Editor was therefore prevailed upon to commit such extracts of letters, and other detach’d pieces as were in his hands to the press, without waiting for the ingenious author’s permission so to do; and this was done with the less hesitation, as it was apprehended the author’s engagements in other affairs, would scarce afford him leisure to give the publick his reflections and experiments on the subject, finish’d with that care and precision, of which the treatise before us shews he is alike studious and capable. He was only apprized of the step that had been thus taken, while the first sheets were in the press, and time enough for him to transmit some farther remarks, together with a few corrections and additions, which are placed at the end, and may be consulted in the perusal.  
The experiments which our author relates are most of them peculiar to himself; they are conducted with judgment, and the inferences from them plain and conclusive; though sometimes proposed under the terms of suppositions and conjectures.  
And indeed the scene he opens, strikes us with a pleasing astonishment, whilst he conducts us by a train of facts and judicious reflections, to a probable cause of those phaenomena, which are at once the most awful, and, hitherto, accounted for with the least verisimilitude.  
He exhibits to our consideration, an invisible, subtile matter, disseminated through all nature in various proportions, equally unobserved, and, whilst all those bodies to which it peculiarly adheres are alike charged with it, inoffensive.  
He shews, however, that if an unequal distribution is by any means brought about; if there is a coacervation in one part of space, a less proportion, vacuity, or want, in another; by the near approach of a body capable of conducting the coacervated part to the emptier space, it becomes perhaps the most formidable and irresistible agent in the universe. Animals are in an Instant struck breathless, bodies almost impervious by any force yet known, are perforated, and metals fused by it, in a moment.

It has, indeed, been of late the fashion to ascribe every grand or unusual operation of nature, such as lightening and earthquakes, to electricity; not, as one would imagine, from the manner of reasoning on these occasions, that the authors of these schemes have, discovered any connection betwixt the cause and effect, or saw in what manner they were related; but, as it would seem, merely because they were unacquainted with any other agent, of which it could not positively be said the connection was impossible.

electrical experiments which have conferred so much celebrity  
on his name. Peter Collinson had sent, in 1745, to the Library-  
society of Philadelphia, an account of the curious facts rela-  
tive to electricity which then engaged the attention of the Eu-  
ropean philosophers, together with a tube for experiments, and di-  
rections for its use. Franklin, together with some of his friends,  
immediately began to apply to the subject. His discoveries were  
communicated in three publications, entitled “ New Experiments  
and Observations on Electricity, made at Philadelphia in Ame-

above quoted for a particular account of our philosopher’s new  
ideas and discoveries, we shall only give a sketch of the most im-  
portant of them. Having been led to think that in the excitation  
of the electric tube, the fluid was conveyed from the person whe  
rubbed it, to him who touched it, he designated the state of the  
latter by the expression of being electrified positively, or plus, as  
having received more than his original quantity of electric fire;  
while the former was said to be electrified negatively, or minus,  
as having lost a part of his natural

An extract from this preface shows in such a striking manner  
Franklin’s indifference about the fate of these papers, the  
appearance of which marked one of the most important  
epochs in the history of modern science, that we place it be-  
fore our readers.  
  
‘¢ It may be necessary to acquaint the reader, that the follow-  
ing observations and experiments were not drawn up with a view  
to their being made public, but were communicated at different

tice to the public, to confine them solely to the limits of a private  
acquaintance.

In this Preface Dr. Fothergil! says: “The experiments which our author relates are most  
of them peculiar to himself; they are conducted with judgment and the inferences from  
them plain and conclusive ; though sometimes proposed under the terms of suppositions  
and conjectures. ....  
  
‘* He exhibits to our consideration an invisible, subtle matter, disseminated through all  
nature in various proportions equally unobserved, and, whilst all those bodies to which it  
peculiarly adheres are alike charged with it, inoffensive.  
  
** He shows, however, that if an unequal distribution is by any means brought about;  
if there is a coacervation in one part of space, a less proportion, vacuity or want in  
another; by the near approach of a body capable of conducting the coacervated part to  
the emptier space, it becomes, perhaps, the most furmidable and irresistible agent in the  
universe. Animals are in an instant struck breathless, bodies almost impervious by any  
force yet known are perforated, and metals fused by it in a moment.”’

When we consider that his work in electricity was but a mere epi-  
sode in the life of Franklin, extending over but a few years of his life,  
there is only wonder at the immensity of his genius. The effect of the  
work of Franklin in accelerating the building up of electrical science  
cannot be over-estimated. Priestley in 1759 wrote: ‘Nothing  
was ever written upon the subject of electricity which was more  
generally read and admired in all parts of Europe than these letters
