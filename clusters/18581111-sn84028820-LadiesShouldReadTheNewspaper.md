LADIES SHOULD READ THE NEWSPAPER.—It is a great mistake in female education to keep a young lady&#x27;s time and attention devoted to only the fashionable literature of the day. If you would qualify her for conversation, you must give her something to talk about—give her education with this actual world and its transpiring events. Urge her to read the newspapers and become familiar with the present character and importance; but the past world is dead, and we have nothing to do with it. Our thoughts and our concerns should be for the present world, to know what it is and improve the condition of it. Let her have an intelligent conversation concerning the mental, moral, political and religious improvement of our times. Let the gilded annuals and poems on the centre-table be kept, a part of the time covered with weekly and daily journals.   
  
Let the whole family—men, woman, and children—read the newspapers.

A HINT TO THE LADIES,  
  
The great fault of female education is that it  
is not sufficiently practical. Itis a great mistake  
to keep a young lady’s time and attention de-  
voted only to the fashionable literature of the  
day. If you would qualify her for conversation,  
you must give her something to talk about.  
Give her an education with this actual world and  
its transpiring events. Urge her to read news-  
papers and be familiar with the present character  
and improvements of our race. History is of  
some importance ; but the past world is dead,  
and we have nothing to do with it. Our thoughts  
and our concerns should be for the present world,  
to know what it is, andimprove the condition of  
it. Let her have an intelligent conversation con-  
cerning the mental, moral, political and religious  
improvements of our times. Let the gilded  
annuals and poems on the centre-table be kept a  
part of the time covered with weekly and daily  
journals. Let the whole family, man, woman  
and children, read the newspaper. And if any-  
body has a thought or fact worth communicating,  
let him not try to make a big sleepy book, but  
speak to the world through the newspapers. This  
is the way to make an intelligent, republican and  
virtuous population. We have seen young ladies  
—those who were called highly educated, and  
who were so, in some respects—who were totally  
ignorant of the movements of the great world  
around them. They should be made to under-  
stand that journals are the records and mirrors  
of the times—a living history—and as such, much  
more valuable than the dead history of the past.

A IIL&#x27;VT TO THE LADIES.  
  
The groat fault of female education is that it  
is not snflScientlj practical. It is a great mistake  
to keep a young lady’s, time and attention de-  
TOted only to the fashionable literature of the  
day. If yon would qualify her for conversation,  
you must give her something to talk about.  
Give her an education with this actual world and  
its transpiring events. Urge her to read news¬  
papers and be familiar with the present character  
and improvements of our race. History is of  
some importance; but the past world is dead,  
and we have nothing to do with it. Our thoughts  
and our concerns should be for the present world,  
to know what it is, and improve the condition of  
it. Let her have an intelligent conversation con¬  
cerning the mental, moral, political and religions  
improvements of our times. Let the gilded  
annuals and poems on the centre-table be kept a  
part of the time covered with weekly and daily  
journals. Let the whole family, man, woman  
and children, read the newspaper. And if any¬  
body has a thought or fael worth communicating,  
let him not try to make a rieepy booL but  
speak to the world through the newspapcrs.^his  
is the way to make an intelligent, republican and  
virtuous population. We have seen young ladies  
—those who were called highly educated, and  
who were so, in some respects—who were totally  
ignorant of the movements of the great world  
around them. They should bo made to under¬  
stand that journals are the records and mirrors  
of the times—a living history—and as such, much  
more valuable than the dead history of the past.

Why Ladies Should Bead Newspapers.—  
It is a great mistake in female education to  
keep a young lady’s time and attention devo­  
ted to only fashionable literature of the day.  
If you would qualify her for conversation,  
you must give her something to talk about—  
give her education with the actual world and  
its transpiring events. Urge her to read the  
newspapers and become familiar with the  
present character and improvement of our  
race. History is of some importance, but the  
past world is dead and we have nothing to do  
with it Out thoughts and our concerns  
should be for the present world, to know  
what it is, and improve the condition of it—  
Let her have an intelligent conversation, con­  
versation concerning the mental,moral, polit­  
ical and religious improvement of our times.  
Let the gilded annuals and poems on the cen­  
tre-table be kept part of. the lime covered  
with weekly and daily journals. Let the  
whole family—men, women and children—  
read the newspapers.
