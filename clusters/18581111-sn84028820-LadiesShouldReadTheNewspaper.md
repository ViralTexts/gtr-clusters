LADIES SHOULD READ THE NEWSPAPER.—It is a great mistake in female education to keep a young lady&#x27;s time and attention devoted to only the fashionable literature of the day. If you would qualify her for conversation, you must give her something to talk about—give her education with this actual world and its transpiring events. Urge her to read the newspapers and become familiar with the present character and importance; but the past world is dead, and we have nothing to do with it. Our thoughts and our concerns should be for the present world, to know what it is and improve the condition of it. Let her have an intelligent conversation concerning the mental, moral, political and religious improvement of our times. Let the gilded annuals and poems on the centre-table be kept, a part of the time covered with weekly and daily journals.   
  
Let the whole family—men, woman, and children—read the newspapers.
