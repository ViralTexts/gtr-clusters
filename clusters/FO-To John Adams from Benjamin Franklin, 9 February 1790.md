 Febry. 3d. 1790  
To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the United States,  
  
The Memorial of the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, the relief of free Negroes unlawfully held in bondage, &amp; the Improvement of the Condition of the African Race—  
Respectfully Sheweth,  
  
That from a regard for the happiness of Mankind an Association was formed several years since in this State by a number of her Citizens of various religious denominations for promoting the Abolition of Slavery &amp; for the relief of those unlawfully held in bondage. A just &amp; accurate Conception of the true Principles of liberty, as it spread through the land, produced accessions to their numbers, many friends to their Cause, &amp; a legislative Co-operation with their views, which, by the blessing of Divine Providence, have been successfully directed to the relieving from bondage a large number of their fellow Creatures of the African Race— They have also the Satisfaction to observe, that in consequence of that Spirit of Philanthropy &amp; genuine liberty which is generally diffusing its beneficial Influence, similar Institutions are gradually forming at home &amp; abroad.  
That mankind are all formed by the same Almighty being, alike objects of his Care &amp; equally designed for the Enjoyment of Happiness the Christian Religion teaches us to believe, &amp; the Political Creed of America fully coincides with the Position. Your Memorialists, particularly engaged in attending to the Distresses arising from Slavery, believe it their indispensible Duty to present this Subject to your notice— They have observed with great Satisfaction, that many important &amp; Salutary Powers are vested in you for “promoting the Welfare &amp; securing the blessings of liberty to the People of the United States.” And as they conceive, that these blessings ought rightfully to be administered, without distinction of Colour, to all descriptions of People, so they indulge themselves in the pleasing expectation, that nothing, which can be done for the relief of the unhappy objects of their care, will be either omitted or delayed—  
From a persuasion that equal liberty was originally the Portion, &amp; is still the Birthright of all Men, &amp; influenced by the strong ties of Humanity &amp; the Principles of their Institution, your Memorialists conceive themselves bound to use all justifiable endeavours to loosen the bands of Slavery and promote a general Enjoyment of the blessings of Freedom. Under these Impressions they earnestly intreat your serious attention to the Subject of Slavery, that you will be pleased to countenance the Restoration of liberty to those unhappy Men, who alone, in this land of Freedom, are degraded into perpetual Bondage, and who, amidst the general Joy of surrounding Freemen, are groaning in Servile Subjection, that you will devise means for removing this Inconsistency from the Character of the American People, that you will promote Mercy and Justice towards this distressed Race, &amp; that you will Step to the very verge of the Powers  
  
vested in you for discouraging every Species of Traffick in the Persons of our fellow Men.

the preamble of which recognizes the doctrines

Your mewmorialists, particularly engaged in attending to the dis-  
tresses arising from slavery, believe it their indispensable duty to  
present this subject to your notice. They have observed with real  
Satisfaction, that many important and salutary powers are vested in  
you for * promoting the welfare and securing the blessings of liberty  
to the people of the United States;’ and as they conceive, that these  
blessings ought rightfuily to be administered, without distinction of  
color, to all descriptions of people, so they indulge themselves in the  
pleasing expectation, that nothing which can be done for the relief  
of the unhappy objects of their care, will be either omitted or de-  
layed. From a persuasion that equal liberty was originally the por-  
tion, and is still the birth-right of all men, and influenced by the  
strong ties of humanity and the principles ot their institution, your  
memorialists conceived themselves bound to use all justifiable endea-  
vors to loosen the bands of slavery, and promote a general enjoy-  
ment of the blessings of freedom. Under these impressions, they  
earnestly entreat your serious attention to the subject of slavery;  
that you will be pleased to countenance the restoration of liberty to  
those unhappy men, who alone, in this land of freedom, are degraded  
into perpetual bondage, and who, amidst the general joy of sur-  
rounding freemen, are groaning in servile subjection ; that you will  
devise means for removing this inconsistency from the character of  
the American people; that you will promote merey and justice  
towards this distressed race, and that you will step to the very verge  
of the power vested in you, for discouraging every species of traffic  
in the persons of our fellow-men.  
“BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, President.

Tho memorial respectfully showoth?  
That, from a regard for tho happiness of  
nankind, an association was formed several  
fears since, in this State, by a number of her  
ntizens, of various religious denominations, for  
promoting the abolition of Slavery, and for the  
relief of thoxo unlawfully held in bondage. A  
just and ueuto conception of the true principles  
of liberty, as it spread through tho land, pro.liistail  
a/imuiuinna hi FKaiv nnmKoru wflnu iVinniU  
  
to thoir cause, and a legislative co operation  
with their views, which, by the blessings of  
Divine l&#x27;rovidonco, have boon successfully directed  
to the relieving from bondago a large  
number of their fellow creatures of the African  
race. They have also the satisfaction to observe,  
that in consequence of that spirit of philanthropy  
and genuino liberty which is generally  
diffusing its beneficial influence, similiar  
institutions aro forming, at home and abroad.  
That mankind aro all formed by the same  
Almighty Being, aliko objects of bis care, and  
equally designed for the enjoyment of happiness,  
tho Christian religion teaches us to believe,  
and tho political creed of Americans  
fully coincides with the position. Your memorialists,  
particularly engaged in attending to  
tho distresses arising from Slavery, lielicvo it  
thoir indispensable duty to present this subject  
to your notice. They have observed, with real  
satisfaction, that many important and salutary  
powers are vested in you for 4&#x27; promoting the  
welfare and securing the blessings of liberty to  
tho people of the United States, &quot; and as they  
conceive that these blessings ought rightfully  
to be administered, without distinction of color,  
to all descriptions of people, so they indulge  
themselves in tho pleasing expectation that  
nothing can ho done for tho rcliof of the unhappy  
objects ol their care will be either omitted  
or delayed.  
From a persuasion that equal liberty was  
originally tno portion and is still the birthright  
of all men, and influenced by tho strong  
ties of humanity nnd the principles of their  
institution, your memorialists conceive themselves  
bound to use all justifiable endeavors to  
loosen the bands of Slavery, and promoto a  
general enjoyment of the blessings of freedom.  
Under these impressions, they earnestly entroal  
your serioas attention to tho subject of Slavery]  
that yon will lie pleased to countenance the  
restoration of liberty to those unhappy men  
who alone, in thin land of freedom, are degra  
ded into perpetual bondage, and who, ainidsl
