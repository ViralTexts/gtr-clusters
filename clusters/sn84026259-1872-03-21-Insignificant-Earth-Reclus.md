Insignificance of the Earth.  
M. Reclus, a celebrated astronomical writer, says this earth is the lowest in rank among heavenly bodies. Were an astronomer on some other planet exploring the immensity of space, this planet we inhabit, owing to its small size, might readily elude his intelligent view.  
The sun is 1,200,000 times larger; and yet that enormous mass is only a speck - a mere point, which seems lost amid eighteen millions of stars which are discoverable by instruments in the Milky Way.  
What an incomprehensible organ the human brain, to have ascertained such astounding facts, and demonstrated the laws which govern universal nature!
