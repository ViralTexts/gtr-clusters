I was very much pleased with some ingenious papers in the late Transactions on the subject of electricity.  
There is something however in the experiments of points, sending off, or drawing on, the electrical fire, which has not been fully explained, and which I intend to supply in my next. For the doctrine of points is very curious, and the effects of them truly wonderfull; and, from what I have observed on experiments, I am of opinion, that houses, ships, and even towns and churches may be effectually secured from the stroke of lightening by their means; for if, instead of the round balls of wood or metal, which are commonly placed on the tops of the weathercocks, vanes or spindles of churches, spires or masts, there should be put

By cutting a leaf into the shape underneath, it may be made to rest in the air, at any required distance from the electrified plate, from a quarter of an inch to a foot, while the nearest non-electric (the floor) may be at 3 or 4 feet distance. If it draws too near the electrified plate, make the top more sharp; if it keeps at too great a distance, make it more dull, or obtuse, by cutting off its points; then, by tryals and a li
