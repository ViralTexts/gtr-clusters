One of the Advantages of great States, is, that the Calamity occasion’d by a foreign War falls only on a very small Part of the Community, who happen from their Situation &amp; particular Circumstances to be expos’d to it.— Thus, as it is always fair Weather in our Parlours, it is at Paris always Peace. The People pursue their respective Occupations, the Playhouse, the Opera, &amp; other publick Diversions, are as regularly &amp; fully attended, as in Times of profoundest Tranquility, and the same small Concerns divide us into Parties.— When you left us, we were Gluckists and Piccinists. Within these few Weeks we are for or against Jeannot, a new Actor. This Man’s Performance, &amp; the Marriage of the Duke de Richelieu fills up much more of our present Conversation, than any thing that relates to the War.— A Demonstration, this, of the Publick Felicity

‘One of the advantages of great states, is, that the ealamity oc-  
casioned by a foreign war falls only on a very small part of the com-  
munity, who happen, from their situation and particular circumstances,  
to be exposed to it. Thus as it is always fair weather in our  
parlours, it is at Paris always peace. The people pursue their re-  
spective occupations: the playhouses, the opera, and other public  
diversions, are as regularly and fully attended, as in times of pro-  
foundest tranquillity, and the same small concerns divide us into parties,  
Within these few weeks we are for or against Jeannot, a new actor.  
This man’s performance, and the marriage of the Duke de Richelieu,  
fills up much more of our present conversation, than any thing that  
relates to the war. A demonstration this of the public felicity.
