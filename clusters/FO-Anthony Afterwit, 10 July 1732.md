Mr. Gazetteer,  
I am an honest Tradesman, who never meant Harm to any Body. My Affairs went on smoothly while a Batchelor; but of late I have met with some Difficulties, of which I take the Freedom to give you an Account.  
About the Time I first address’d my present Spouse, her Father gave out in Speeches, that if she married a Man he liked, he would give with her £200 on the Day of Marriage. ’Tis true he never said so to me, but he always receiv’d me very kindly at his House, and openly countenanc’d my Courtship. I form’d several fine Schemes, what to do with this same £200 and in some Measure neglected my Business on that Account: But unluckily it came to pass, that when the old Gentleman saw I was pretty well engag’d, and that the Match was too far gone to be easily broke off; he, without any Reason given, grew very angry, forbid me the House, and told his Daughter that if she married me he would not give her a Farthing. However (as he foresaw) we were not to be disappointed in that Manner; but having stole a Wedding, I took her home to my House; where we were not in quite so poor a Condition as the Couple describ’d in the Scotch Song, who had  
Neither Pot nor Pan,  
But four bare Legs together;  
for I had a House tolerably furnished, for an ordinary Man, before. No thanks to Dad, who I understand was very much pleased with his politick Management. And I have since learn’d that there are old Curmudgeons (so called) besides him, who have this Trick, to marry their Daughters, and yet keep what they might well spare, till they can keep it no longer: But this by way of Digression; A Word to the Wise is enough.  
I soon saw that with Care and Industry we might live tolerably easy, and in Credit with our Neighbours: But my Wife had a strong Inclination to be a Gentlewoman. In Consequence of this, my old-fashioned Looking-Glass was one Day broke, as she said, No Mortal could tell which way. However, since we could not be without a Glass in the Room, My Dear, says she, we may as well buy a large fashionable One that Mr. Such-a-one has to sell; it will cost but little more than a common Glass, and will be much handsomer and more creditable. Accordingly the Glass was bought, and hung against the Wall: But in a Week’s time, I was made sensible by little and little, that the Table was by no Means suitable to such a Glass. And a more proper Table being procur’d, my Spouse, who was an excellent Contriver, inform’d me where we might have very handsome Chairs in the Way; And thus, by Degrees, I found all my old Furniture stow’d up into the Garret, and every thing below alter’d for the better.  
  
Had we stopp’d here, we might have done well enough; but my Wife being entertain’d with Tea by the Good Women she visited, we could do no less than the like when they visited us; and so we got a Tea-Table with all its Appurtenances of China and Silver. Then my Spouse unfortunately overwork’d herself in washing the House, so that we could do no longer without a Maid. Besides this, it happened frequently, that when I came home at One, the Dinner was but just put in the Pot; for, My Dear thought really it had been but Eleven: At other Times when I came at the same Hour, She wondered I would stay so long, for Dinner was ready and had waited for me these two Hours. These Irregularities, occasioned by mistaking the Time, convinced me, that it was absolutely necessary to buy a Clock; which my Spouse observ’d, was a great Ornament to the Room! And lastly, to my Grief, she was frequently troubled with some Ailment or other, and nothing did her so much Good as Riding; And these Hackney Horses were such wretched ugly Creatures, that—I bought a very fine pacing Mare, which cost £20. And hereabouts Affairs have stood for some Months past.  
I could see all along, that this Way of Living was utterly inconsistent with my Circumstances, but had not Resolution enough to help it. Till lately, receiving a very severe Dun, which mention’d the next Court, I began in earnest to project Relief. Last Monday my Dear went over the River, to see a Relation, and stay a Fortnight, because she could not bear the Heat of the Town. In the Interim, I have taken my Turn to make Alterations, viz. I have turn’d away the Maid, Bag and Baggage (for what should we do with a Maid, who have (except my Boy) none but our selves). I have sold the fine Pacing Mare, and bought a good Milch Cow, with £3 of the Money. I have dispos’d of the Tea-Table, and put a Spinning Wheel in its Place, which methinks looks very pretty: Nine empty Canisters I have stuff’d with Flax; and with some of the Money of the Tea-Furniture, I have bought a Set of Knitting-Needles; for to tell you a Truth, which I would have go no farther, I begin to want Stockings. The stately Clock I have transform’d into an Hour-Glass, by which I gain’d a good round Sum; and one of the Pieces of the old Looking-Glass, squar’d and fram’d, supplies the Place of the Great One, which I have convey’d into a Closet, where it may possibly remain some Years. In short, the Face of Things is quite changed; and I am mightily pleased when I look at my Hour-Glass, what an Ornament it is to the Room. I have paid my Debts, and find Money in my Pocket. I expect my Dame home next Friday, and as your Paper is taken in at the House where she is, I hope the Reading of this will prepare her Mind for the above surprizing Revolutions. If she can conform to this new Scheme of Living, we shall be the happiest Couple perhaps in the Province, and, by the Blessing of God, may soon be in thriving Circumstances. I have reserv’d the great Glass, because I know her Heart is set upon it. I will allow her when she comes in, to be taken suddenly ill with the Headach, the Stomach-ach, Fainting-Fits, or whatever other Disorders she may think more proper; and she may retire to Bed as soon as she pleases: But if I do not find her in perfect Health both of Body and Mind the next Morning, away goes the aforesaid Great Glass, with several other Trinkets I have no Occasion for, to the Vendue that very Day. Which is the irrevocable Resolution of, Sir, Her loving Husband, and Your very humble Servant,  
Anthony Afterwit

LETTER FROM ANTHONY AFTERWIT.  
  
Mr. Gazetteer,—I am an honest tradesman who never  
meant harm to any body. My affairs went on smoothly  
while a bachelor; but of late I have met with some  
difficulties of which 1 take the freedom to give you an  
account.  
  
About the time I first addressed my present spouse,  
her father gave out in speeches that if she married a  
man he liked, he would give with her 200. in cash on  
the day of marriage. He never said so much to me, it  
is true, but he always received me very kindly at his  
house, and openly countenanced my courtship. I formed  
several fine schemes what to do with this same 200I.  
and in some measure neglected my business on that  
account ; but unluckily it came to pass that when the  
old gentleman saw I was pretty well engaged and that  
the match was too far gone to be easily broke off, he  
without any reason given, grew very angry, forbid me  
the house, and told his daughter that if she married me  
he would not give her a farthing. However (as he  
thought) we were not to be disappointed in that man-  
ner, but having stole a wedding I took her home to my  
house, where we were not in quite so poor a condition  
as the couple described in the Scotch song, who had  
  
Neither pot nor pan  
  
But four bare legs together,  
for I had a house tolerably furnished for a poor man,  
before. No thanks to Dad, who, I understand, was  
very much pleased with his politic management ; and  
I have since learned that there are other old curmud-  
geons (so called) besides him, who have this trick to  
marry their daughters, and yet keep what they might  
well spare, till they can keep it no longer. But this by  
way of digression, a word to the wise is enough.  
  
I soon saw that with ease and industry we might live  
tolerably easy and in credit with our neighbors ; but  
my wife had a strong inclination to be a gentlewoman.  
In consequence of this, my old fashioned looking glass  
was one day broke, as she said, no one could tell which  
way. However, since we could not be without a glass  
in the room, My dear, saith she, we may as well buy a  
large fashionable one that Mr. Such-a-one has to sell. It  
will cost but little more than a common glass, and will look  
much handsomer and more creditable. Accordingly, the  
glass was bought and hung against the wall, but in a  
week’s time I was made sensible by little and little, that  
the table was by no means suitable to such a glass; anda  
more proper table being procured, some time after, my  
spouse, who was an excellent contriver, informed me  
where we might have very handsome chairs in the way ;  
and thus by degrees I found all my old furniture stow-  
ed up in the garret, and every thing below altered for  
the better.  
  
Had we stopped here it might have done well enough.  
But my wife being entertained with tea by the good  
women she visited, we could do no less than the like  
when they visited us, and so we got a tea table with  
all its appurtenances of china and silver. Then my  
Spouse unfortunately overworked herself in washing  
the house, so that we could do no longer without a maid.  
  
  
  
Besides this, it happened frequently that when I came  
home at one, the dinner was but just put in the pot,  
and my dear thought really it had been but eleven. At other  
times when I came at the same hour, she wondered I  
would stay so long, for dinner was ready about one and had  
wailed for me these two hours, These irregularities oc-  
casioned by mistaking the time convinced me that it  
was absolutely necessary to buy a clock, which my spouse  
observed was a great ornament to the room. And lastly,  
to my grief, she was troubled with some ailment or  
other, and nothing did her so much good as riding, and  
these hackney horses were such wretched ugly creatures  
that—I bought a very fine pacing mare which cost 201. ;  
and hereabouts affairs have stood for about a twelve-  
month past.  
  
I could see all along that this did not at all suit with  
my circumstances, but had not resolution enough to  
help it, till lately receiving a very severe dun which  
mentioned the next court, | began in earnest to project  
relief. Last Monday, my dear went over the river to  
see a relation and stay a fortnight, because she could  
not bear the heat of the town air. In the interim I  
have taken my turn to make alterations, viz.—I have  
turned away the maid, bag and baggage—(for what  
should we do with a maid, who beside our boy, have  
none but ourselves?) I have sold the pacing mare and  
bought a good milch cow with 31. of the money. I have  
disposed of the table and put a good spinning wheel  
in its place, which methinks looks very pretty: nine  
empty canisters I have stuffed with flax, and with some  
of the money of the tea furniture | have bought a set of  
knitting needles, for to tell you the truth I begin to want  
stockings. The fine clock I have transformed into an  
hour glass, by which | have gained a good round sum,  
and one of the pieces of the old looking glass squared  
and framed, supplies the place of the great one, which  
I have conveyed into a closet where it may possibly  
remain some years. In short the face of things is quite  
changed, and methinks you would smile to see my hour  
glass hanging in the place of the clock,—what a great  
ornament it is to the room! I have paid my debts and  
find money in my pocket. I expect my dear home  
next Friday, and as your paper is taken at the house  
where she is, I hope the reading of this will prepare her  
mind for the above surprising revolutions. If she can  
conform herself to this new manner of living, we shall  
be the happiest couple perhaps in the province, and by  
the blessing of God may soon be in thriving cireum-  
stances. I have reserved the great glass because I  
know her heart is set upon it; I will allow her when  
she comes in to be taken suddenly ill with the headache,  
the stomach ache, fainting fits, or whatever other disorder  
she may think more proper, and she may retire to bed  
as soon as she pleases. . But if I should not find her in  
perfect health both of body and mind the next morning,  
away goes the aforesaid great glass with several other  
trinkets I have no occasion for, to the vendue that very  
day—which is the irrevocable resolution  
  
Of, Sir, her loving husband and  
Your very humble servant,  
ANTHONY AFTERWIT,
