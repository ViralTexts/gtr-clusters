Passy, Feb. 12. 1778.  
A thousand Thanks for your so readily engaging in the Means of relieving our poor Captives, and the Pains you have taken, and the Advances you have made for that purpose. I received your kind Letter of the 3d Instant, and send you enclosed a Bill for £100. I much approve of Mr. Wrens prudent, as well as benevolent, Conduct in the Disposition of the Money; and wish him to continue doing what shall appear to him and you to be right, which I am persuaded will appear the same to me and my Colleagues here. I beg you will present him when you write my respectful Acknowledgements.  
Your “earnest Caution and Request, that nothing may ever persuade America to throw themselves into the Arms of France; for that Times may mend; and that an American must always be a Stranger in France, but that Great Britain may for Ages to come be their home,” marks the goodness of your heart, your Regard for us, and Love of your Country. But when your Nation is hiring all the Cut Throats it can collect of all Countries and Colours to destroy us, it is hard to persuade us not to ask and accept of Aid, from any Power that may be prevail’d with to grant it; and this only from the hope that tho’ you now thirst for our Blood and pursue us with Fire and Sword, you may in some future time treat us kindly. This is too much Patience to be expected of us; indeed I think it is not in Human Nature. The Americans are received and treated here in France with a Cordiality, a Respect and Affection, they never experienced in England when they most deserved it, and which is now (after all the Pains taken to exasperate the English against them, and render them odious as well as contemptible) less to be expected there than ever. And I cannot see why we may not upon an Alliance hope for a continuance of it, at least of as much as the Swiss enjoy, with whom France has maintained a faithful Friendship for 200 Years past, and whose People appear to live here in as much Esteem as the Natives. America has been forc’d and driven into the Arms of France. She was a dutiful and virtuous Daughter. A cruel Mother-in-Law turn’d her out of Doors, defamed her, and sought her Life. All the world knows her Innocence and takes her Part. And her Friends hope soon to see her honourably married. They can neve

The Subscription for the Prisoners will have excellent Effects in favour of Englishmen, and of England. The Scotch Subscriptions for raising Troops to destroy us, tho’ amounting to much greater Sums, will not do their Nation half so much good. If you have an Opportunity, I wish you would express our respectful Acknowledgements and Thanks to your Committee and Contributors, whose benefactions will make our poor People as comfortable as their Situation can permit

Passy, Feb. 12, 1778.  
  
My Dear Sir—A thousand thanks for your so readily engaging in the  
means of relieving our poor captives. (The writer here goes into mat-  
ters of account as to bills, &amp;c., drawn by Hartley on him for the relief of  
the prisoners.) Your earnest caution and request that nething may ever  
persuade Americans to throw themselves into the arms of France, for that  
times may mend, and that an American mnst always be a stranger in  
France, but that Great Britain may for ages to come be their home,  
marks the goodness of your heart, your regard for us, and your love for  
your country. But when your nation is biring all the cut-throats it can  
collect, of all countries and colors, to destroy us, it is hard to persuade us  
not to ask or accept of Aid from any Power that may be prevailed with  
to grant it, and this from the hope that, though you now thirst for our  
Blood, and pursue us by Fire and Sword, you may in some future time  
treat us kindly. This is too much patience to be expected of us—indeed,  
it is not in human nature.  
with a Cordiality, a Respect, and an Affection, thy never received in

driven into the Arms of France. She was a Dutiful and Virtuous Daugh-
