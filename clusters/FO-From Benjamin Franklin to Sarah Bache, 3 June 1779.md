 and tell them I wish them all sorts of happiness.  
The clay medallion of me you say you gave to Mr. Hopkinson was the first of the kind made in France. A variety of others have been made since of different sizes; some to be set in lids of snuff boxes, and some so small as to be worn in rings; and the numbers sold are incredible. These, with the pictures, busts, and prints, (of which copies upon copies are spread every where) have made your father’s face as well known as that of the moon, so that he durst not do any thing that would oblige him to run away, as his phiz would discover him wherever he should venture to show it. It is said by learned etymologists that the name Doll, for the images children play with, is derived from the word Idol; from the number of dolls now made of him, he may be truly said, in that sense, to be i-doll-ized in this country.  
I think you did right to stay out of town till the summer was over for the sake of your child’s health. I hope you will get out again this summer during the hot months; for I begin to love the dear little creature from your description of her.  
I was charmed with the account you give me of your industry, the table-cloths of your own spinning, &amp;c. but the latter part of the paragraph, that you had sent for linen from France because weaving and flax were grown dear; alas, that dissolved the charm; and your sending for long black pins, and lace, and feathers! disgusted me as much as if you had put salt into my strawberries. The spinning, I see, is laid aside, and you are to be dressed for the ball! you seem not to know, my dear daughter, that of all the dear things in this world, idleness is the dearest, except mischief.

The present you mention as sent by me, was rather that of a merchant at Bourdeaux, for he would never give me any account of it, and neither Temple nor I know any thing of the particulars.  
When I began to read your account of the high prices of goods, “a pair of gloves seven dollars, a yard of common gause twenty-four dollars, and that it now required a fortune to maintain a family in a very plain way,” I expected you would conclude with telling me, that every body as well as yourself was grown frugal and industrious; and I could scarce believe my eyes in reading forward, that “there never was so much dressing and pleasure going on;” and that you yourself wanted black pins and feathers from France, to appear, I suppose, in the mode! This leads me to imagine that perhaps, it is not so much that the goods are grown dear, as that the money is grown cheap, as every thing else will do when excessively plenty; and that people are still as easy nearly in their circumstances as when a pair of gloves might be had for half a crown. The war indeed may in some degree raise the prices of goods, and the high taxes which are necessary to support the war may make our frugality necessary; and as I am always preaching that doctrine, I cannot in conscience or in decency encourage the contrary, by my example, in furnishing my children with foolish modes and luxuries. I therefore send all the articles you desire that are useful and necessary, and omit the rest; for as you say you should “have great pride in wearing any thing I send, and showing it as your father’s taste;” I must avoid giving you an opportunity of doing that with either lace or feathers. If you wear your cambric ruffles as I do, and take care not to mend the holes, they will come in time to be lace; and feathers, my dear girl, may be had in America from every cock’s tail.  
If you happen again to see General Washington, assure him of my very great and sincere respect, and tell him that all the old Generals here amuse themselves in studying the accounts of his operations, a

“The clay medallion of me you say you gave to  
Mr. Hopkinson was the first of the kind made in  
France. A variety of others have been made since  
of different sizes; some to be set in the lids of  
snuff-boxes, and some so small as to be worn in  
rings; and the numbers sold are incredible. These,  
with the pictures, busts, and prints (of which copies  
upon copies are spread every where), have made  
your father’s face as well known as that of the  
moon ; so that he durst not do any thing that would  
oblige him to run away, as his phiz would discover  
him wherever he should venture to show it. It is  
said by learned etymologists that the name doll,  
for the images children play with, is derived from  
the word rpoL. From the number of dolls now  
made of him, he may be truly said, in that sense, to  
be i-po..-ized in this country.”  
  
The old philosopher had a vein of sarcasm as  
well as humor about him; witness the following  
question and answer:  
  
** Question. I am about courting a girl I have  
had but little acquaintance with—how shall I come  
to a knowledge of her faults, and whether she has  
the virtues I imagine she has?  
  
“* Answer, Commend her among her female ac-  
quaintance.”  
  
His daughter had written to him to send her  
from Paris some lace and feathers, which extrav-  
agance, on her part, he says “disgusted me as  
much as if you had put salt into my strawberries.”

## From _Sunbury American._

#### 1855-07-21 &middot; [Sunbury, Pa.](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sunbury%2C_Pennsylvania)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
&quot;I was charmed with the account you gave  
me of your industry, the table cloths of your  
own spinning, &amp;c., but the latter part of your  
paragraph, that you had sent for linen from  
France, because weaving and flax were grow­  
ing dear, alas! that dissolved the charm; and  
you sending for long black pins, and lace and  
feathers, disgusted me, as if you had put salt  
into my strawberries. The spinning I see is  
to be laid aside, and you are to be dressed for  
the ball. You seem not to know, my dear  
daughter, that of all the dear things in the  
world, idleness is the dearest except mischief.  
hen I began to read your account of the  
high prices of goods, a pair of gloves seven  
dollars! a yard of common gauze twenty-four  
dollars! and that it now required a fortune  
to maintain a family in a very plain way.  
I expected you would conclude with telling  
me that everybody as well as yourself, was  
growing frugal and industrious; and I could  
scarce believe my eyes in reading forward,  
that there never was so much dressing and  
pleasure going on! and that you wanted black  
pins and feathers from France to appear I  
suppose in the mode. This leads me to ima­  
gine that, perhaps, it is not so much that the  
goods are grown dear, as money is grown  
cheap; as everything else will do when exces­  
sively plenty, and that people are still as  
nearly in their circumstances as when a pair  
of gloves might be had for half a crown. The  
war, indeed, may in some degree raise the  
price of goods--and the high taxes which are  
necessary to support a war, may make our  
frugality necessary; and as I am always  
preaching that doctrine, I cannot inconscience  
or in decency, encourage the contrary, by my  
example, in furnishing my children with fool­  
ish modes and luxuries. I therefore send all  
the articles you desire that are useful or nec­  
essary, and omit the rest, for as you say you  
should have great pride in wearing anything  
I send, and showing it as your father&#x27;s taste,&quot;  
I must avoid giving you an opportunity of  
doing that with lace or feathers. If you wear  
your cambric ruflles as I do, and take care  
not to mend the holes, they will come in time  
to be lace; and feathers! my dear girl, may  
be had in America from every cock&#x27;s tail.&quot;

LETTER ON EXTRAVAGANCE.  
  
A LETTER of Franklin to his daughter, written  
in 1781, rebuking her expressed desire for “ French  
finery,” might furnish a good text for our preseat  
importation leagues :  
  
“When I began to read your account of the high  
prices of goods, ‘a pair of gloves seven dollars, a  
  
ard of common gauze twenty-four dollars, and that  
  
it now required a fortune to maintain a family in a  
very plain way,’ Lexpected you would conclude by  
telling me that everybody, as well as yourself, was  
= frugal and industrious ; and I ‘could scarce  
  
lieve my eyes, im reading forward, that ‘there  
never was so much pleasure and dressing goi&#x27;  
on ;’ and that you yourself wanted black pins dm  
feathers from nce, to appear, I suppose, in the  
mode! This leads me to imagine that, perhaps, it  
is not 80 much that the goods are grown dear as  
that the money has grown cheap, as everything  
else will do when rma S| plenty; and that  
people are still as easy, nearly, in their circum-  
stances as when a pair of gloves might be had for  
half a crown. The war, indeed, may in some de-  
gree raise the prices of goods, and the high taxes  
which are necessary to support the war may make  
our frugality necessary; and, as I am always preach-

cency encourage the contrary, by my example, in  
furn ~ my children with foolish modes and

never was so much pleasure and dressing going on ; and that  
you yourself wanted black pins and feathers from France to  
appear, I suppose, in the mode! This leads me to imagine,  
that perhaps it is not so much that the goods are grown dear  
as that the money is grown cheap, as everything else will do  
when excessively plenty; and that people are still as easy  
nearly in their circumstances as when gloves might be had  
for half a crown. The war, indeed, may in some degree raise  
the price of goods, and the high taxes which are necessary to  
support the war may make our frugality necessary ; and, as I  
am always preaching that doctrine, I cannot in conscience or  
in decency encourage the contrary by my example, in furnish-  
ing my children with foolish modes and luxuries. I, there-  
fore, send all the articles you desire that are useful and neces-  
sary, and omit the rest; for, as you say, you should ‘have  
great pride in wearing anything I send, and showing it as your  
father’s taste,’ I must avoid giving you an opportunity of  
doing that with either lace or feathers. If you wear your  
cambric ruffles as I do, and take care not to mend the holes,  
they will come in time to be lace ; and feathers, my dear girl,  
they may be had in America from every cock’s tail.”

At the close of the third period of  
the American Revolution—from the  
Declaration of Independence to the  
surrender of Burgoyne—according to  
the division of John Fiske, the British  
were defeated in the second blow at the

Burgoyne was forced to surrender at  
Saratoga on October 17, 1777.
