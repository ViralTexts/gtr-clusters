tory, the maps, &amp;c.  
You desire my opinion of Pere Beccaria’s Italian Book. I have read it with much Pleasure, and think it one of the best pieces on the Subject that I have seen in any Language. Yet as to the Article of Waterspouts, I am not at present of his Sentiments; tho’ I must own with you, that he has handled it very ingeniously. Mr. Collinson has my Opinion of Whirlwinds and Waterspouts at large, written sometime since: I know not whether they will be publish’d; if not, I will get them Transcrib’d for your Perusal. It does not appear to me that Pere Beccaria doubts of the absolute Impermeability of Glass in the sense I meant it; for the Instances he gives of Holes made thro’ Glass by the electric Stroke, are such as we have all experienc’d, and only shew that the electric Fluid could not pass without making a Hole. In the same Manner we say, Glass is impermeable to Water, and yet a Stream from a Fire Engine will force thro’ the strongest Panes of a Window. As to the Effect of Points in drawing the electric Matter from Clouds and thereby securing Buildings, &amp;c. which you say he seems to doubt, I must own I think he only speaks modestly and judiciously. I find I have been but partly understood in that Matter. I have mentiond it in several of my Letters, and except once, always in the Alternative, viz. that pointed Rods erected on Buildings, and communicating with the moist Earth would either prevent a Stroke, or, if not prevented, would conduct it, so as that the Building should suffer no Damage. Yet whenever my opinion is examin’d in Europe, nothing is consider’d but the Probability of those Rods preventing a Stroke, or Explosion, which is only a Part of the Use I proposed from them, and the other part, their conducting a Stroke which they may happen not to prevent, seems to be totally forgotten, tho’ of equal Importance and Advantage.  
I shall be very glad to be acquainted with the experiments of M. le Roy on positive and negative electricity, when you can impart them to me.  
I thank you for communicating M. de Buffon’s Relation of the Effect of Lightning at Dijon on the 7th of June last. In return give me leave to relate an Instance I lately saw of the same kind. Being in the Town of Newbury in New England in November last, I was shewn the Effect of Lightning on their Church, which had been struck a few Months before.  
The Steeple was a Square Tower of Wood, reaching 70 feet up from the Ground, to the place where the Bell hung, over which rose a Taper spire, of Wood likewise, reaching 70 Foot higher, to the Vane or Weather Cock.  
Near the Bell was fix’d an Iron Hammer to strike the Hours; and from the Tail of the Hammer a Wire went down thro’ a small Gimlet Hole in the Floor that the Bell stood upon, and thro’ a second Floor in like manner; then horizontally under and near the plaister’d Cieling of that second Floor, till it came near a plaister’d Wall; then down by the side of that Wall to a Clock, which stood about 20 feet below the Bell. The Wire was not bigger than a common Knitting Needle. The Spire was split all to pieces by the Lightning and the parts flung in all Directions over the square in which the Church stood, so that nothing remain’d above the Bell.  
The Lightning pass’d between the Hammer and the Clock in the abovemention’d Wire, without hurting either of the Floors or having any Effect upon them, except making the Gimlet Holes, thro’ which the Wire pass’d, a little bigger, and without hurting the plaister’d Wall, or any part of the Building so far as the aforesaid Wire and the Pendulum Wire of the Clock extended, which latter Wire was about the Thickness of a Goose Quill. From the End of the Pendulum down quite to the Ground, the Building was exceedingly rent and damaged, and some Stones in the Foundation Wall torn out, and thrown to the Distance of 20 or 30 feet. No part of the aforemention’d long small Wire, between the Clock and the Hammer, cou’d be found, except about two Inches that hung to the Tail of the Hammer, and about as much that was fastened to the Clock; the rest being exploded, and its particles dissipated in Smoke and Air, as Gunpowder is by common Fire, and had only left a black smutty Track on the Plaistering, three or four Inches broad, darkest in the middle, and fainter towards the Edges, all along the Cieling under which it passed, and down the Wall. These were the Effects and Appearances; on which I would only make the few following Remarks. Viz.  
1. That Lightning, in its passage thro’ a Building, will leave Wood to pass as far as it can in Metal, and not enter the Wood again till the Conductor of Metal ceases.  
  
And the same I have observ’d in other Instances, as to Walls of Brick or Stone.  
2. The Quantity of Lightning that pass’d thro’ this Steeple must have been very great by its Effects on the lofty Spire above the Bell, and on the Square Tower all below the End of the Clock pendulum.  
3. Great as this Quantity was, it was conducted by a small Wire and a Clock pendulum, without the least Damage to the Building so far as they extended.  
4. The Pendulum Rod being of a sufficient Thickness, conducted the Lightning without Damage to itself, but the small Wire was utterly destroy’d.  
5. Tho’ the small Wire was itself destroy’d, yet it had conducted the Lightning with safety to the Building.  
6. And from the Whole it seems probable, that if even such a small Wire had been extended from the Spindle of the Vane to the Earth, before the Storm, no Damage would have been done to the Steeple by that Stroke of Lightning, tho’ the Wire itself had been destroy’d.

before the Royal Society, Dec. 18, 1755.  
  
OU defire my opinion of Pere’Bec-  
caria’s Italian book. I have réad  
it with muchpleafure, and think it oné  
of the beft pieces on the fubject that F  
have feen in any language, Yet as to  
the article of water-fpouts, I am not at  
prefent in his fentiments; though&#x27;I mutt  
own with you, that he has handled it &#x27;v  
ingenioufly. Mr. Collinfon has my opt-  
nion of whirlwinds and water-{pouts at  
large, written fome time fince. I know  
not whether they will be publifhed; if not  
I will get them tranfcribed for your peru-  
fal. It does not appear to me, that Pere  
Beccaria doubts of the abfolute tmperme-  
ability of giafs in the fenfe I meant it;  
for the tadfaiites he gives of holes made  
through glafs by the electric ftroke are  
fuch, as we have all experienc’d, and  
only fhew, that the electric fluid could not  
pafs without making a hole. In the fame  
manner we fay, glafs 1s impermeable to  
water, and yet a ftream from a fire-engine  
will force through the ftrongelt panes of a  
window. As to the effeét of points in  
drawing the electric matter from clouds,  
and thereby fecuring buildings, Gc.  
which, you fay, he feems to doubt, I muft  
own I think he only fpeaks modettly and  
judicioufly. I find I, have been but  
partly underftood in that matter. T have  
mentioned it in feveral of my letters, and  
except once always in the alternative, viz.  
that pointed rods ereéted on buildings, and  
communicating with the moift earth,  
would either prevent a ftroke, or if not  
prevented, would condu it, fo as wr ae  
UMG-

building fhould fuffer no damage. Yet  
whenever my opinion is examined in £u-  
rope, nothing is confidered but the pro-  
bability of thofe rods preventing a ttroxe,  
or explofion ; which 1s only a part of the  
ufe 1 propoied from them; and the other  
part, their conducting a ftroke, which they  
may happen not to prevent, fecms to be  
totally forgotten, tho’ of equal impor-  
tance and advantage.  
  
I thank you for communicating M. de  
Boffon’s veiation of the effect of lightning  
at Dijou, on the feventh of Fune lait.  
In return give me leave to relate an in-  
ftance I lately faw of the fame kind. Be-  
ing in the town of Newbury in New-Eng-  
land, in November \aft, 1 was fhewn the  
effeét of lightning on their church, which  
had been ftruck a few months before.  
The fteeple was a f{quare tower of wood  
reaching ieventy feet up from the ground  
to the place where the bell hung, over  
which rofe a taper fpire of wood likewile,  
reaching feventy feet higher, to the vane  
or weather-cock, near the bell was fixed  
an iron hammer to ftrike the hours; and  
from the tale of the hammer a wire went  
down through a {mall gimblet-hole in the  
flour that the bell ftood upon, and through  
a fecond floor in like manger; then hori-  
zontally under and near the plaiftered cie-  
ling of that fecond floor, till it came near  
a plaiftered wall; then down by the fide  
of that wall to a ciock, which ftooj about  
twenty feet below the bell. ‘The wire  
was not bigger than a common kniting  
needle. The fpire was fplit all to pieces  
by the lightning, and the parts flung in  
all dire€tions over the {quare, in which  
the church ftood, fo that nothing remained  
above the bell.  
  
The lightning paffed between the ham-  
mer and the clock in the above-mentioned  
wire, without hurting either of the floors,  
or having any effect upon them, except  
making the gimblet-holes, through which  
the wire paffed, a little bigger, and with-  
out hurting the plaiftered wall, or any  
part of the building. fo far as the afore-  
faid wire and the pendulum wire of the  
clock extended; which latter wire was  
about the thickneis of a goofe quill.  
From the end of the pendulum down  
quite to the ground the building was ex-  
ceedingly rent and damaged, and fome  
itones in the foundation wall torn out, and  
thrown to the diftance of twenty or thir-  
ty feet. No part of the aforementioned  
long fmall wire between the clock and  
the hammer could be found, except about  
  
  
  
On the Comet expected in 1757 or 1758.  
  
two inches, that hung to the tail of the  
hammer, and about as much that was  
taitened to the clock ; the reit being explo-  
ded, and its parucies diffipated in fmoke  
and air, as gun-powder is by common  
fire, and had only left a black finutty  
track on the platitering, three or four  
inches broad, darkeft in the middle and  
fainter towards the edges, all along the  
cieling under which it pafled, and down  
the wall. ‘Thefe were the effects and ap-  
pearances: on which I would only make  
the few followins remarks; viz.  
  
1. That lightning, in its paflage through  
a building, will leave wood to pais as  
far as it can in metal, and not enter the  
wood again till the conductor of metal  
ceales.  
  
And the fame I have obferved in other  
  
inftances as to walls of brick or ftone.  
  
2. The quantity of lightning, that  
paffied through this fteeple, muft have  
been very great by its effeéts on the lofty  
{pire above the bell, and on the fquare  
tower all below the end of the clock pen-  
dulum.  
  
3. Great as this quantity was, it was  
conducted by a fmall wire and a clock pen-  
dulum, without the leaft damage to the  
building fo far as they extended.  
  
4. The pendulum rod being of a fufhi-  
cient thickne.s, conduéted the lightning  
without damage to itfelt; but the {mail  
wire was utterly deftroyed.  
  
. Though the fmall wire was itfelf  
dahoayed, yet it had conduéted the light-  
ning with fafety to the building.  
  
6. And from the whole it feems pro-  
bable, that if even fuch a finall wire had  
been extended from the fpindle of the vane  
to the earth, before the ftorm, no damage  
would have been done to the fteeple by  
that ftroke of lightning, though the wire  
itfelf had been deftroyed.

Beccaria’s views, and he says—“ As to the effect of points  
in drawing the electric matter from the clouds, and thereby  
securing buildings, &amp;c., which you say he seems to doubt, I  
must own I think he only speaks modestly and judiciously.  
I have been but partly understood in that matter. I have  
mentioned it in several of my letters, and, except once,  
always in the alternative, viz., that pointed rods erected on  
buildings, and communicating with the moist earth, would  
either prevent a stroke, or, if not prevented, would conduct  
it, so that the building should sufferno damage. Yet, when-  
ever my opinion is examined in Europe, nothing is considered  
but the probability of those rods preventing a stroke or ex-  
plosion, which is only part of the use I proposed for them ;  
and the other part, their-conducting a stroke which they  
may happen not to prevent, seems to be totally forgotten,  
though of equal importance and advantage.”
