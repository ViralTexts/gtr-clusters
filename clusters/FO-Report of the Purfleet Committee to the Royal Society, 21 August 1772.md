It is a lofty building, with a pointed hip-roof, the copings of lead down to the gutters, from which leaden pipes descend at each end of the building into the water of wells of 40 feet deep, for the purpose of conveying water forced up by engines to a cistern in the roof. There is also a proof-house, adjoining to the end of one of the magazines, and a clock-house, at the distance of [blank in text] feet from them, which has a weathercock on an iron spindle, and, probably, some incompleat conductors within, such as the wire usually extending up from a clock to its hammer, the

The blowing up of a magazine of gun-powder by lightning, within a few years past, at Brescia in Italy, which demolished a considerable part of the town, with the loss of many lives, does, in our opinion, strongly urge the propriety of guarding such magazines from that kind of danger; and since it is now well known, from many observations, that metals have the property of conducting lightning, and a method has been discovered of using that property for the security of buildings, by so disposing and fixing iron rods, as to receive, and convey away, such lightning as might otherwise have damaged them; which method has been practised near twenty years in many places, and attended with success, in all the instances that have come to our knowledge, we cannot, therefore, but think it adviseable to provide conductors of that kind for the magazines in question.  
In common cases, it has been judged sufficient; if the lower part of the conductor were sunk three or four feet into the ground, till it came to moist earth; but this being a case of the greatest importance, we are of opinion that greater precaution should be taken. Therefore, we would advise, that, at each end of each magazine, a well should be dug in or through the chalk, so deep as to have in it at least four feet of standing water. From the bottom of this water should arise a piece of leaden pipe, to or near the surface of the ground, where it should be strongly joined to the end of an upright iron bar, an inch and half diameter, fastened to the wall by leaden straps, and extending ten feet above the ridge of the building, tapering from the ridge upwards to a sharp point, the upper 12 inches of copper, the iron to be painted.  
We mention lead for the under-ground part of the conductor, as less liable to rust in water and moist places; in the form of a pipe, as giving greater stiffness for the substance; and iron for the part above-ground, as stronger, and less likely to be cut away. The pieces, of which the bar may be composed, should be screwed strongly into each other, by a close joint, with a thin plate of lead between the shoulders, to make the joining or continuation of the metal more perfect. Each rod, in passing above the ridge, should be strongly and closely connected by iron or lead, or both, with the leaden coping of the roof, whereby a communication of metal will be made between the two bars of each building, for a more free and easy conducting of the lightning into the earth.  
We also advise, in consideration of the great length of the buildings, that two wells, of the same depth with the others, should be dug within twelve feet of the doors of the two outside magazines; that is to say, one of them on the north side of the north building, the other on the south side of the south building; from the bottom of which wells, similar conductors should be carried up to the eaves, there joining well with a plate of lead, extending on the roof up to the leaden coping of the ridge, the said plate of lead being of equal substance with that of the coping.  
We are further of opinion, that it will be right to form a communication of lead from the top of the chimney of the proof-house to the lead on its ridge, and thence to the lead on the ridge of the corridor, and thence to the iron conductor of the adjacent end of the magazine; and also to fix a conductor from the bottom of the weather-cock spindle of the clock-house, down on the outside of that building, into the moist earth.  
As to the board-house, we think it already well furnished with conductors, by the several leaden communications above-mentioned, from the point of the roof down into the water, and that, by its height and proximity, it may be some security to the buildings below it; we therefore propose no other conductor for that building, and only advise erecting a pointed iron rod on the summit, similar to those before described, and communicating with those conductors.  
To these directions we would add a caution, that, in all future alterations or repairs of the buildings, special care be taken that the metalline communications be not cut off or removed.

‘ The blowing up of a magazine of gun-powder by lightning,  
within a few years paft, at Brefcia in Italy, which demolifhed a  
confiderable part of the town, with the lols of many lives, does,  
in our opinion, ftrongly urge the propriety of guarding fuch ma.  
gazines Irbes that kind of danger ; and fince it is now well known,  
trom many obfervations, that metals have the property of con-  
ducting lightning, and a method has been difcovered of ufing that  
property for the fecurity of buildings, by fo difpofing and fixing  
jron rods, as to receive, and convey away, fuch lightning as might  
otherwife have damaged them; which method has been praétifed  
near twenty years in many places, and attended with fuccefs, in  
all the inftances that have come to our knowledge, we cannot,  
therefore, but think it advifeable to provide conductors of that  
kind for the magazines in quettion.  
  
‘ In common cafes, it has been judged fufficient, if the lower  
  
art of the conductor were funk three or four feet into the ground,  
till it came to moift earth; but this being a cafe of the greateft  
importance, we are of opinion that greater precaution fhould be  
taken. Therefore, we would advife, that, at each end of each  
magazine, a well fhould be dug in or through the chalk, fo deep as  
to have in it at leaft four feet of ftanding water. From the bot-  
tom of this water fhould arife a piece of leaden pipe, to or near the  
furface of the ground, where it fhould be ttrongly joined to the end  
of an upright iron bar, an inch and ‘half diameter, faftened to the  
wall by leaden ftraps, and extending ten feet above the ridge of the  
building, tapering from the ridge upwards toa fharp point, the up-  
per twelve inches of copper, the iron to be painted.  
  
¢ We mention lead for the under-ground part of the conduétor,  
as lefs liable to ruft in water and moift places; in the form of a  
pipe, as giving greater ftiffnefs for the fubftance ; and iron for the:  
  
rt above ground, as ftronger, and lefs likely to be cut away.  
  
_pa  
The pieces, of which the bar may be compofed, fhould be fcrewed  
  
ftrongly into each other, by a clofe joint, with.a thin plate of lead’  
between the fhoulders, to make the joining or continuation of:the  
metal more perfect, Each rad, in pafling above the-ridge, thould:  
be ftrongly and clofely conneéted by iron or lead, or both, with.  
the leaden coping of the roof, whereby a communication of metal,  
will be made between the two bars of each building, fora more  
free and eafy conducting of the lightning into the earth.  
  
‘ We alfo advife, in confideration of the great length of the,  
  
buildings, that two wells, of the fame depth with the. others,,  
fhould be dug within twelve feet of the doors of the two.outfide  
magazines; that is to fay, one of them on the north fide of the

ried up to the eaves, there joining well witha plate of lead, ex-  
tending on the roof up to the leaden coping of the ridge, the  
faid plate of lead being of equal fubftance with that of the

houfe to the lead on its ridge, and thence to the lead on the ridge  
of the corridor, and thence to the iron conduétor of the adjacent  
end of the magazine; and alfo to fix a conduétor from the bottom  
of the weather cock fpindle of the clock-houfe, down on the out-  
fide of that building, into the moift earth.  
  
‘ As to the board-houfe, we think it already well furnifhed with  
conductors, by the feveral leaden communications above-men-  
tioned, from the point of the roof down into the water, and that,  
by its height and proximity, it may be fome fecurity to the build-  
ing below it; we therefore propofe no other conduétor for that  
building, and only advife erecting a pointed iron rod on the fum-  
mit, fimilar to thofe before defcribed, and communicating with

nished. The damage, it is trae, was small; a few stones  
fastened by iron cramps not connected with the condac-  
tor were thrown down. The Board-honse was a lofty  
building, with a pointed roof, well leaded, and connected  
by lead gatters and pipes with the earth, and with wells  
forty feet deep, for the purpose of conveying water forced  
up to acistern in the roof. it was therefore only thought  
necessary to add an iron spike, about ten feet long, to the  
middle of the highest part of the roof. About one hun-

magazines, eachone hundred and sixty feet long and fifty-  
two feet wide, having spiked conductors at each end pro-

tee constituted to consider the best form of lightning-rod  
for powder-magazines, and he himself drew up a report in  
which there occurs the following most notable passage :

each end of each magazine a well should be dug so as to

bottom of this water should rise a piece of leaden pipe to,  
or near to, the surface of the ground, where it should be  
joined to the end of an upright bar,” to be itself connected  
with the earth end of the conductor.  
  
Yet in the face of this sound doctrine, even at the  
present day men of some scientific attainment may be  
sometimes heard to say that it is enough for a lightning-  
rod to have its base just thrust a few inches into the earth.
