Inclos’d is the Order you desire for another Hundred Louis.— Take my Blessing with it, and my Prayers that God may send you safe &amp; well home with your Cargoes. I would not attempt persuading you to quit the military Line, because I think you have the Qualities of Mind and Body that promise your doing great Service &amp; acquiring Honour in that Line. Otherwise I should be happy to see you again here as my Successor; having sometime since written to Congress requesting to be reliev’d, and believing as I firmly do, that they could not put their Affairs in better Hands.— I shall ever be Most affectionately yours
