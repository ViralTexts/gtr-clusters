 Peltry. Her Expences in Governing and Defending that Settlement must be considerable. It might be humiliating to her to give it up on the Demand of America. Perhaps America will not demand it: Some of her politic Rulers may consider the fear of Such a Neighbour as a Means of keeping the 13 States more united among themselves, and more attentive to Military Discipline. But on the Minds of the People in general, would it not have an excellent Effect, if Britain Should voluntarily offer to give up this Province; tho’ on these Conditions, that she shall in all times coming have &amp; enjoy the Right of Free Trade thither, unincumbred with any Duties whatsoever; and that so much of the vacant Lands there shall be sold, as will raise a Sum sufficient to pay for the Houses burnt by the British Troops and their Indians; and also to indemnify the Royalists for the Confiscation of their Estates.

Before Oswald left Paris, Franklin placed in his hands a paper,  
containing suggestions respecting Canada, for Lord Shelburne’s  
consideration. It threw out the idea that Canada might be  
voluntarily ceded to the United States, as an indemnity for the  
losses occasioned by the tvar; and it concluded with these  
words: — ‘ This is mere conversation matter between Mr. Oswald  
‘ and Mr. Franklin, as the fonuer is not empowered to make
