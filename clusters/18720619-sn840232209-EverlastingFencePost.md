EVERLASTING FENCE POSTS.—There is a peculiar satisfaction in listening to the conversation, or in reading the writings of positive men,—as those who deal only with facts, and with such facts as have but one side and no exceptions. Such a man tells us, in the _Western Rural_, how to preserve posts for fences &amp;c. He says:—&quot;I discovered many years ago that wood could be made to last longer than iron in the ground, but thought the process so simple and inexpensive that it was not worth while making any stir about it. I would as soon have poplar, basswood, or quaking ash as any other kind of timber for fence posts. I have taken out basswood after having been set seven years, that were as sound when taken up as when first set in the ground. Time and weather seemed to have no effect on them. The posts can be prepared for less than two cents apiece.   
  
For the benefit of others, I will give the recipe. Take boiled linseed oil, and stir in pulverized charcoal to the consistency of paint. Put a coat over the timber, and there is not a man that will live long enough to see it rotten.

Cement for an Aquarium.—l send  
you a receipt which I have used eight  
years in my own aquarium w th perfect  
success. The cement has never been re­  
moved, and the tank has never leaked a  
drop during the time: One part by  
measure, say a gill, of litharge: one gill  
of plaster of Paris ; one gill of drv, white  
sand ; one third of a gill of finely pow­  
dered resin. Sift, and keep corked  
tight till required for us«, when it is to  
be made into a putty by mixing with  
boiled linseed oil, with a little patent  
dryer added. Never use it after it has  
been mixed with the oil after fifteen  
hours. The cement can be u»ed in ma­  
rine as well as fresh water aquaria, as it  
resists the action of salt water. But the  
tank must have either an iron or stone  
frame work ; a wooden one would warp  
and cannot be made tight with any kind  
of cement. Be sure your plaster of Pans  
is pure. Dentists always keep that  
which is good. It is best to let the tank  
stand a day or two before the water is  
put in. The best plants I have used are  
the water-cress and the Galla lily.—  
of Rural New Yorker.

be put on with shingle or lath nails, and need only  
lap on to the board at top and bottom two inches.  
Next saw a bunch of lath in two, and with a sharp  
jack-knife sharpen the end of each piece, after  
which extend your pickets above the top board by  
nailing on the sharpened pieces, allowing them to  
lap on the top board three inches. You have now a  
finished fence six feet nine inches in height. Of  
course this would not do where stock could rub

There is no greater everyday virtue than  
cheerfulness. This quality in man among  
men is like sunshine to the day, or gentle,  
renewing moisture to parched herbs. The  
light of a cheerful face diffuses itself, and  
communicates the happy spirit that inspires  
it. The sourest temper must sweeten in  
the atmosphere of continuous good humor.

A correspondent of the Western Rural  
has practiced the following1 for eight  
years: &quot; I take good, sound seed, put it  
in a tub or some other convenient ves­  
sel, take one and one-half pounds salt­  
petre per bushel, dissolve it and pour  
it over the corn ; let it soak until the  
corn is swelled ready to sprout, and  
then plant. The worms will not trouble  
it.&quot;  
Snakes : A sensible correspondent of  
the Maine Farmer says he made up his  
mind years ago that every snake that is  
killed by the farmer is money out of the  
pocket of the snake-killer ; for he firmly  
believes that when the snake is looked  
upon in its true light in relation to the  
farmer, the conclusion will be that that  
individual has but few better friends  
than the despised snake.

the process so simple and inexpen­

of the Western  
Rural makes the following rather  
hard to believe, but paasibly correct  
statements:  
“I diseov red many years ago that  
wood could be made to last longer  
than iron in the ground, but thought  
the process so simple and inexpensive  
that it was not necessary to muke  
any stir about it. I would as soon  
have poplar or basswood, or quaking  
ash as any posts after having Seen Mt  
seven years, that were as sound when  
taken up as when first put in the  
ground. Time and weather seems to  
have no effect on them. The  
can be prepared for less than two  
cents apiece.  
For the benefit of others, I will  
give the receipt:&#x27; Take boiled linseed  
oil and stir it in pulverized charcoal  
of paint. Pat a coat of thia over tho  
timber, and there is not a mad that  
will live to see it rotten.”
