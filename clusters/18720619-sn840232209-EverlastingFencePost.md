EVERLASTING FENCE POSTS.—There is a peculiar satisfaction in listening to the conversation, or in reading the writings of positive men,—as those who deal only with facts, and with such facts as have but one side and no exceptions. Such a man tells us, in the _Western Rural_, how to preserve posts for fences &amp;c. He says:—&quot;I discovered many years ago that wood could be made to last longer than iron in the ground, but thought the process so simple and inexpensive that it was not worth while making any stir about it. I would as soon have poplar, basswood, or quaking ash as any other kind of timber for fence posts. I have taken out basswood after having been set seven years, that were as sound when taken up as when first set in the ground. Time and weather seemed to have no effect on them. The posts can be prepared for less than two cents apiece.   
  
For the benefit of others, I will give the recipe. Take boiled linseed oil, and stir in pulverized charcoal to the consistency of paint. Put a coat over the timber, and there is not a man that will live long enough to see it rotten.

How TO MAKE FENCE POSTS LAST  
FOREVER.—A correspondent of the  
Western Rural says—I discovered  
many years ago that wood could be  
made to last, longer than iron, in the  
ground, but thought the process so sim­  
ple and inexpensive, that it was not  
worth while making any stir about it.  
I would as soon have poplar, basswood,  
or quaking ash, as any other kind of  
timber for fence posts. I have taken  
out basswood posts after having been  
set seven years, that were ss sound  
when they were taken up as when they  
were first put in the ground. Time  
and weather seemed to have no effect  
on them. The posts can be prepared  
for less than two cents apiece. For  
the benefit of others I will give the  
receipe. Take boiled linseed oil and  
stir in it pulverised charcoal to the  
consistency of paint. Put a coat of  
this over the timber, and there is not a

To Preserve Fence Posts.—Some  
one who has tried it says ; ‘ T discovered  
many years ago, that wood could be made  
to last longer than iron in the ground, but  
thought the process so simple and inex­  
pensive it was; not worth making a stira­  
bout it. I would as soon have poplar, bass­  
wood or quaking ash as any other kind  
of timber for fence posts. After having  
been set when seven years, tL j were as  
sound they,were taken out,as when they  
were first put in the ground. Time and  
weather seem to have no effect upon  
them. The posts can be prepared for  
less the two cents apiece. This is the  
recipe : Take boiled linseed oil and stir  
it in pulverized chai-coal to the consis­  
tency of paint. Put a coat of this &#x27;wer  
the timber, and there is not a man who

Kverlnsting Fence.  
A correspondent gives the Western Ku­  
ril his method of making everlasting  
fence posts He says he discovered mam  
m ills ago that si od call be made to last  
longi r than iron in the ground, but  
thought the process so simple and inex­  
pensive that it was not wiuth while to  
make any stir about it. lie would as soon  
have poplar or ash as any other kind of  
timber lor posts, lie lias taken out bass­  
mind posts, alter having been set seven  
years, that were as sound when taken up  
as when put in the ground. Time and  
weather seemed to have no effect upon  
them The posts can be prepared for less  
than two cents. Take boiled linseed oil  
and stir in pulverized charcoal to the con­  
sistency ot paint. Tut a coat ot this over  
the timber, and there is not a man that  
will live long enough to see it rot

next meeting  
Some one who has tried it says. “I  
discovered many years ago that wood  
could be made to last longer than iron  
in the ground, but thought the process  
so simple and inexpensive that it was  
not worth while making any stir about  
it. I would as soon have poplar, bass­  
wood or quaking asp as any other kind  
of timber for fence posts. After hav­  
ing been set for seven years they were  
as sound when they were taken out as  
when they were first put in the ground.  
Time and weather seems to have no  
effect upon them The posts can be  
prepared for less than two cents apiece.  
This is the recipe: take boiled linseed  
oil and stir in it pulverized charcoal to  
the consistency of paint. Put a coat of  
this over the timber and there is not a  
man who will live to see it rot.
