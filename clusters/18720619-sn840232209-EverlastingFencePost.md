EVERLASTING FENCE POSTS.—There is a peculiar satisfaction in listening to the conversation, or in reading the writings of positive men,—as those who deal only with facts, and with such facts as have but one side and no exceptions. Such a man tells us, in the _Western Rural_, how to preserve posts for fences &amp;c. He says:—&quot;I discovered many years ago that wood could be made to last longer than iron in the ground, but thought the process so simple and inexpensive that it was not worth while making any stir about it. I would as soon have poplar, basswood, or quaking ash as any other kind of timber for fence posts. I have taken out basswood after having been set seven years, that were as sound when taken up as when first set in the ground. Time and weather seemed to have no effect on them. The posts can be prepared for less than two cents apiece.   
  
For the benefit of others, I will give the recipe. Take boiled linseed oil, and stir in pulverized charcoal to the consistency of paint. Put a coat over the timber, and there is not a man that will live long enough to see it rotten.

Everlasting Fence Post.— I discovered ma­  
ny years ago that wood could be made to last  
longer than iron in the ground, but thought  
the process was so simple and inexpensive that  
it was not worth while making any stir about  
it. I would as soon have poplar, basswood or  
quaking ash as any other kinds of timber for  
fence posts. I have taken out basswood posts  
after having been set for eleven years that  
were as sound when taken up as when they  
were first put in the ground. Time and weath­  
er seemed to have no effect on them. The posts  
can be prepared for less than two cents apiece.  
For the benefit of others I will give the re­  
cipe : Take boiled linseed oil and stir it in  
pulverized charcoal to the consistency of paint.  
Put a coal of this over the timber, nnd there is  
not a man will live to see it rotten. Carres

A correspondent gives the Western  
Rural his receipt for everlasting fence  
posts. He says: &quot;I discovered many  
years ago that wood can be m tae to  
last longer than iron in the ground,  
but thought the process so simple and  
inexpensive that it was not worth  
while to make any stir about it. 1

any othr kind of timber for posts. I  
have taken out bass wood posts, after  
having been set seven years, that were  
as sound when taken up as when put  
in the ground. Time and weather  
seemed to Lave no effect upon them.  
The nosts can be nrenared for less than  
t wo cents. Take boiled linseed oil and  
stir in pulverized charcoal to the con  
sistency or paint. Put a coat of this  
over the timber, and there is not a  
man that will live long enough to see  
it rotten
