ur kind Letter of the 7th of April, also one of the 3d of May. I have always great Pleasure in hearing from you, in learning that you are well, and that you continue your Experiments. I should rejoice much if I could once more recover the Leisure to search with you into the Works of Nature, I mean the inanimate, not the animate or moral Part of them. The more I discover’d of the former, the more I admir’d them; the more I know of the latter, the more I am disgusted with them. Men I find to be a Sort of Beings very badly constructed, as they are generally more easily provok’d than reconcil’d, more dispos’d to do Mischief to each other than to make Reparation, much more easily deceiv’d than undeceiv’d, and having more Pride &amp; even Pleasure in killing than in begetting one another, for without a Blush they assemble in great Armies at Noon Day to destroy, and when they have kill’d as many as they can, they exaggerate the Number to augment the fancied Glory; but they creep into Corners or cover themselves with the Darkness of Night, when they mean to beget, as being asham’d of a virtuous Action. A virtuous Action it would be, and a vicious one the killing of them, if the Species were really worth producing or preserving; but of this I begin to doubt. I know you have no such Doubts, because in your Zeal for their Welfare, you are taking a great deal of Pains to save their Souls. Perhaps as you grow older you may look upon this as a hopeless Project, or an idle Amusement, repent of having murdered in mephitic Air so many honest harmless Mice, and wish that to prevent Mischief you had used Boys and Girls instead of them. In what light we are view’d by superior Beings, may be gather’d from a Piece of late West India News, which possibly has not yet reach’d you. A young Angel of Distinction being sent down to this World on some Business for the first time, had an old Courier-Spirit assign’d him as a Guide. They arriv’d over the Seas of Martinico in the middle of the long Day of obstinate Fights between the Fleets of Rodney &amp; DeGrasse. When thro’ the Clouds of Smoke he saw the Fire of the Guns, the Decks cover’d with mangled Limbs, &amp; Bodies dead or dying, the Ships sinking, burning, or blown into the Air, and the Quantity of Pain, Misery, and Destruction the Crews yet alive were thus with so much Eagerness dealing round to one another; he turn’d angrily to his Guide, &amp; said, You blundering Blockhead, you are ignorant of your Business; you undertook to conduct me to the Earth, and you have brought me into Hell!— No, Sir, says the Guide; I have made no Mistake; this is really the Earth, and these are Men. Devils never treat one another in this cruel manner; they have more Sense, and more of what Men (vainly) call Humanity!  
But to be serious, my dear old Friend, I love you as much as ever, and I love all the honest Souls that meet at the London Coffeehouse. I only wonder how it happen’d that they and my other Friends in England, came to be such good Creatures in the midst of so perverse a Generation. I long to see them and you once more, and I labour for Peace with more earnestness, that I may again be happy in your sweet Society.

merely. He was sometimes on the borders of desperation,  
with regard to politics. See his letter to ur. Priestley, dated  
from Passy, June 7, 1782; when he was ‘ weary of talking  
to inattentive heads,’ and, for the ‘first time, had fairly got  
out of patience with mankind.  
  
‘I should rejoice much if I could once more recover the lei-  
sure to search with you into the works of nature; I mean the  
inanimate, not the animate or moral part ef them: the more I  
discovered of the former, the more I admired them; the more I  
know of the latter, the more Iam disgusted with them. Men, I  
find to be a sort of beings very badly constructed, as they are  
generally more easily provoked than reconciled, more disposed to  
do mischief to each other than to make reparation, much more  
easily deceived than undeceived, and having more pride and even  
pleasure in killing than in begetting one another; for without a  
blush they assemble in great armies at noon-day to destroy, and  
when they have killed as many as they can, they exaggerate the  
number to augment the fancied glory; but they creep into cor-  
ners, or cover themselves with the darkness of night when they  
mean to beget, as being ashamed of a virtuous action. A virtu-  
ous action it would be, and a vicious one the killing of them, if  
the species were really worth producing or preserving; but of  
this I begin to doubt. I know you have no such doubts, because  
in your zeal for their welfare, you are taking a great deal of  
pains to save their souls. Perhaps as you grow older, you may  
look upon this as a hopeless project, or an idle amusement, re-  
pent of having murdered in mephitic air so many honest, harm-  
less mice, and wish that to prevent mischief you had used boys  
and girls instead of them.’

their peculiarities, be always ready to es­  
cort them any where, amuse them when  
they are dull, and laugh with them when  
they are lively; and though you may b

The following apologue about the

beauty, that characterized every  
thing of this kind from his pen, and  
manifests his deep horror of war.

ophy could afford to understand the true  
character of the race. The following are  
consequently to be considered as his mature  
views. He writes:  
  
“‘The more I know of the animate or  
moral part of the works of Nature the more  
I am disgusted with them. Men 1 find to  
be a sort of beings very badly constructed,  
as they are generally more easily provoked  
than reconciled, more disposed to do mis-  
chief to each other than to make reparation,  
much more easily deceived than unde-  
ceived, and having pride and even pleasure  
in killing one another. Without a blush  
they assemble in great armies at noonday  
to destroy; and when they have killed as  
many as they can they exaggerate the  
number, to augment the fancied glory.  
The killing of them would be a vicious  
action if the species were really worth pre-  
serving; but of this I begin to doubt.  
  
“T know you have no such doubts;  
because, in your zeal for their welfare, you  
are taking a great deal of pains to save  
their souls. Perhaps as you grow older  
you may look upon this as a hopeless pro-  
ject or an idle amusement; repent of having  
murdered in mephitic air so many honest,  
harmless mice, and wish that, to prevent  
mischief, you had used boys and girls, in-  
stead of them  
  
“In what light we are viewed by superior  
beings may be gathered by a piece of West  
Indian news, which possibly has not yet  
reached you. A young angel of destruction  
being sent down to this world on some  
business, for the first time, had an old  
courier spirit assigned him as a guide.  
They arrived over the seas at Martinico,  
in the middle of a long day of obstinate  
fight between the fleets of Rodney and De  
Grass. When through the clouds of smoke  
he saw the fires of the guns, the decks  
covered with mangled limbs and bodies  
dead or dying, the ships sinking, burning,  
or blown into the air, and the quantity of  
pain, misery, and destruction the crews  
yet alive were thus with so much eagerness  
dealing round to one another, he turned  
angrily to his guide and said:  
  
***¢You blundering blockhead, you are  
ignorant of your business. You undertook  
to conduct me to the earth, and you have  
brought me into Hell !’  
  
«No, sir,’ said the guide; ‘I have made  
  
these are men. Devils never treat one  
another in this cruel manner. They have  
more sense and more of what men (vainly)  
call humanity.’”  
  
David Hume, one of the most illustrious  
of those deists, now called scientists, writes  
in the following gloomy strain:  
  
‘‘T seem affrighted and confounded with  
the solitude in which I am placed. When  
1 look abroad, on every side I see dispute,  
contradiction, distrust. When I turn my  
eyes inward, I find nothing but doubts and  
ignorance. Where am I or what am 1?  
From what cause do I derive my existence?  
To what condition shali I return? I am  
confounded with these questions. I begin  
to fancy myself in the most deplorable’con-  
dition, environed with the deepest darknes
