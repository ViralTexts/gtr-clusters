Passy, near Paris, December 24, 1777.  
The bearer, Mr. Holker, is a gentleman of great worth and excellent character, and a particular friend of mine, who, if he sees encouraging prospects, may possibly make some commercial prospects in America; in which case you may be assured that his engagements will be executed with good faith, and the exactest punctuality. I recommend him warmly to your civilities and to those of my other friends. And, as he is well acquainted with the state of affairs here, I am persuaded his conversation would give a good deal of satisfaction to gentlemen in publick situations with you; and therefore I request that you would introduce him to the acquaintance of Mr. Bowdoin, Dr. Cooper, Mr. Winthrop, Mr. Cushing, and others engaged in the government of your state. Your affectionate uncle,
