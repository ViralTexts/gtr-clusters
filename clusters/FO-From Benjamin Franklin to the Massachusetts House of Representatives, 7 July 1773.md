a in all Cases whatsoever.  
When one considers the King’s Situation, surrounded by Ministers, Councellors, and Judges learned in the Law, who are all of this Opinion; and reflect how necessary it is for him to be well with his Parliament, from whose yearly Grants his Fleets and Armies are to be supported, and the Deficiencies of his Civil List supplied, it is not to be wondered at that he should be firm in an Opinion establish’d as far as an Act of Parliament could establish it, by even the Friends of America at the Time they repeal’d the Stamp-Act; and which is so generally thought right by his Lords and Commons, that any Act of his, countenancing the contrary, would hazard his embroiling himself with those Powerful Bodies. And from hence it seems hardly to be expected from him that [he] should take any Step of that kind. The grievous Instructions indeed might be withdrawn without their observing it, if his Majesty thought fit so to do; but under the present Prejudices of all about him, it seems that this is not yet likely to be advised.  
The Question then arises, How are we to obtain Redress? If we look back into the Parliamentary Hi

e diminish as well as its Credit. Men will be wanted as well as Money. The Colonies are rapidly increasing in Wealth and Numbers. In the last War they maintained an Army of 25000. A Country able to do that is no contemptible Ally. In another War they may do perhaps twice as much with equal Ease. Whenever a War happens, our Aid will be wish’d for, our Friendship desired and cultivated, our Good will courted: Then is the Time to say, Redress our Grievances. You take Money from us by Force, and now you ask it of voluntary Grant. You cannot have it both Ways. If you chuse to have it without our Consent, you must go on taking it that way and be content with what little you can so obtain. If you would have our free Gifts, desist from your Compulsive Methods, acknowledge our Rights, and secure our future Enjoyment of them. Our Claims will then be attended to, and our Complaints regarded.

ments, certain that their period must be  
brief.  
  
The colonies are rapidly increasing in wealth  
and numbers [he pointed out]. In the last war  
they maintained an army of twenty-five thousand.  
A country able to do that is no contemptible ally.  
In another war they may perhaps do twice as  
much with equal ease. Whenever a war happens  
our aid will be wished for, our friendship desired  
and cultivated, our good-will courted. Then is the  
time to say, “ Redress our grievances. -You take  
money from us by force, and now you ask it of  
voluntary grant. You cannot have it both ways.  
If you choose to have it without our consent, you

pulsive methods, and acknowledge our rights,

claims will then be attended to, and our com-
