r 18, 1783]  
The Qualities hitherto sought in a Hygrometer, or Instrument to discover the Degrees of Moisture &amp; Dryness in the Air, seem to have been, an Aptitude to receive Humidity readily from a moist Air, and to part with it as readily to a dry Air. Different Substances have been found to possess more or less of this Quality; but when we shall have found the Substance that has it in the greatest Perfection, there will still remain some Uncertainty in the Conclusions to be drawn from the Degree shown by the Instrument, arising from the actual State of the Instrument itself as to Heat &amp; Cold. Thus if two Bottles or vessels of Glass or Metal being filled, the one with cold &amp; the other with hot-Water, are brought into a Room; the Moisture of the Air in the Room will attach itself in Quantities to the Surface of the cold Vessel, while if you actually wet the surface of the hot Vessel, the Moisture will immediately quit it, and be absorbed by the same Air. And thus in a sudden Change of the Air from cold to warm, the Instrument remaining longer Cold may condense &amp; absorb more Moisture, and mark the Air as having become more humid than it is in Reality; and the contrary in a Change from warm to cold.  
But if such a suddenly changing Instrument could be freed from these Imperfections, yet when the Design is to discover the different Degrees of Humidity in the Air of different Countries; I apprehend the quick Sensibility of the Instrument to be rather a Disadvantage; since to draw the desired Conclusions from it, a constant &amp; frequent Observation Day &amp; Night in each Country will be necessary for a Year or Years, and the mean of each different Set of Observations is to be found &amp; determined. After all which some Uncertainty will remain respecting the different Degrees of Exactitude with which different Persons may have made and taken Notes of their Observations.  
For these Reasons I apprehend that a Substance which tho’ capable of being distended by Moisture &amp; contracted by Dryness, is so slow in receiving and parting with its Humidity that the frequent Changes in the Atmosphere have not time to affect it sensibly, and which therefore should gradually take nearly the Medium of all those Changes &amp; preserve it constantly, would be the most proper Substance of which to make Such an Hygrometer.  
Such an Instrument, you, my dear Sir, tho’ without intending it, have made for me; and I without desiring or expecting it have received from you. It is therefore with Propriety that I address to you the following Account of it, and the more as you have both a Head to contrive and a hand to execute the Means of perfecting it. And I do this with greater Pleasure as it affords me the Opportunity of renewing that antient Correspondence &amp; Acquaintance with you, which to me was always so pleasing &amp; so instructive.  
You may possibly remember that in or about the Year 1758, you made for me a Set of artificial Magnets, Six in Number, each 5 ½ Inches Long, ½ an Inch broad, &amp; ⅙ of an Inch thick. These with two Pieces of Soft Iron which together equalled one of the Magnets were inclos’d in a little Box of Mahogony Wood, the Grain of which ran with, &amp; not across, the Length of the Box; and the Box was clos’d by a Little Shutter of the same Wood, the Grain of which ran across the Box; and the Ends of this shutting Piece were bevel’d so as to fit &amp; slide in a kind of Dovetail Groove when the Box was to be shut or open’d.  
I had been of Opinion that good Mahogony Wood was not affected by Moisture so as to change its Dimensions, &amp; that it was always to be found as the Tools of the Workman left it. Indeed the Difference at different Times in the same Country is so small as to be scarcely in a common Way observable. Hence the Box which was made so as to allow sufficient Room for the Magnets to Slide out and in freely, and when in, afforded them so much Play that by shaking the Box one could make them strike the opposite Sides alternately, continued in the same State all the Time I remain’d in England, which was four Years, without any apparent Alteration. I left England in August 1762 and arriv’d at Philadelphia in October the same Year. In a few Weeks after my Arrival, being desirous of showing your Magnets to a Philosophical Friend, I found them so tight in the Box, that it was with Difficulty I got them out; and constantly during the two Years I remain’d there, Viz till November 1764, this Difficulty of getting them out and in continued. The little Shutter too, as Wood does not shrink lengthways of the Grain, was found too long to enter its Grooves, &amp; not being us’d was mislaid and Lost, and I afterwards had another made that fitted.  
In December 1764 I returned to England and after some time I observed that my Box was become full big enough for my Magnets, and too wide for my new Shutter; which was so much too Short for its Grooves, that it was apt to fall out; and to make it keep in, I lengthen’d it by adding to each End a little Coat of Sealing Wax.  
I continued in England more than 10 Years, and During all that time after the first Change, I perceived no Alteration. The Magnets had the same Freedom in their Box, and the little Shutter continued with the added Sealing Wax to fit its Grooves, till some Weeks after my second Return to America.  
As I could not imagine any other Cause for this Change of Dimensions in the Box, when in the different Countries, I concluded first generally that the Air of England was moister than that of America. And this I supposed an Effect of its being an Island, where every Wind that blew must necessarily pass over some Sea before it arrived, and of Course lick up some Vapour. I afterwards indeed doubted whether I had not been too general in my Conclusion; and whether it might not be just only so far as related to the City of London, where I resided; because there are many Causes of Moisture in the City Air, which do not exist to the same Degree in the Country; such as the Brewers’ &amp; Dyers’ boiling Cauldrons, and the great Number of Pots and Teakettles continually on the Fire, sending forth abundance of Vapour; and also the Number of Animals who by their Breath constantly increase it, to which may be added that even the vast Quantity of Sea Coals burnt there, in kindling discharge a great deal of Moisture.  
When I was in England the last time, you also made for me a little Achromatic Pocket Telescope. The Body was Brass, and it had a round Case (I think of thin Wood) covered with Shagrin. All the while I remained in England, tho’ possibly there might be some small Changes in the Dimensions of this Case, I neither perceived nor suspected any. There was always comfortable Room for the Telescope to slip in and out. But soon after I arrived in America, which was in May 1775, the Case became too small for the Instrument, it was with much Difficulty &amp; various Contrivances that I got it out, and I could never after get it in again; during my Stay there, which was 18 Months. I brought it with me to Europe, but left the Case as useless, imagining that I should find the continental Air of France as dry as that of Pensilvania where my Magnet Box had also returned a second time to its Narrowness, &amp; pinched the Pieces as heretofore, obliging me, too, to scrape the Sealing Wax off the Ends of the Shutter.  
I had not been long in France, before I was surprized to find, that my Box was become as large as it had always been in England, the Magnets enter’d and came out with the same Freedom, and when in, I could rattle them against its Sides; this has continued to be the Case without sensible Variation. My Habitation is out of Paris, distant almost a league, so that the moist Air of the City cannot be supposed to have much Effect upon the Box: &amp; I am on a high dry Hill in a free Air, as likely to be dry as any Air in France. Whence it seems probable, that the Air of England in general may, as well as that of London, be moister than the Air of America, since that of France is so, and in a Part so distant from the Sea.  
The greater Dryness of the Air in America appears from some other observations. The Cabinet Work formerly sent us from London, which consisted in thin Plates of fine Wood glu’d upon Fir, never would stand with us, the Vaneering, as those Plates are call’d, would get loose &amp; come off; both Woods shrinking, and their Grains often crossing, they were forever cracking and flying. And in my Electrical Experiments there, it was remarkable, that a Mahogony Table on which my Jars stood under the Prime Conductor to be charged, would often be so dry particularly when the Wind had been some time at N. W. which with us is a very drying Wind, as to isolate the Jars, and prevent their being charged till I had formed a Communication between their Coatings and the Earth. I had a like Table in London which I us’d for the same Purpose all the time I resided there; but it was never so dry as to refuse conducting the Electricity.  
  
Now what I would beg leave to recommend to you, is, that you would recollect if you can, the Species of Mahogony of which you made my Box, for you know there is a good deal of Difference in Woods that go under that Name; or if that cannot be, that you would take a Number of Pieces of the closest and finest grain’d Mahogony that you can meet with, plane them to the thinness of about a Line, and the Width of about two Inches across the Grain; and fix each of the Pieces in some Instrument that you can contrive, which will permit them to contract &amp; dilate, and will show in sensible Degrees, by a moveable Hand upon a marked Scale, the otherwise less sensible Quantities of such Contraction and Dilatation. If these Instruments are all kept in the same Place while making, and are graduated together while subject to the same Degrees of Moisture or Dryness, I apprehend you will have so many comparable Hygrometors which being sent into different Countries, and continued there for some time will find and show there the Mean of the different Dryness &amp; Moisture of the Air of those Countries; and that with much less Trouble than by any other Hygrometer hitherto in use. With great Esteem I am, dear Sir, Your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant  
B Franklin

change from warm to cold.  
  
But if fuch a fuddenly changing inftrument could be  
freed from thefe imperfections, yet when the defign is to  
difcover the different degrees of humidity in the air of dif-  
ferent countries, [ apprehend the quick fenfibility of the

defired conclufions from it, a conftant and frequent obfer-  
vation day and night-in each country will be neceflary for

fervations is to be found and determined. After all which  
fome uncertainty will remain refpeCting the different de-  
grees of exadtitude with which different perfons may have  
made and taken notes of their obfervations.  
  
For thefe reafons, I apprehend that a fubftance which,  
though capable of being diftended by moifture and con-  
tracted by drynefs, is fo flow in receiving and parting with  
its humidity that the frequent changes in the atmo{phere  
have not time to affect it fenfibly, and which: therefore  
fhould gradually take nearly the medium of all. thofe  
changes and preferve it conftantly, would be the moft pro-  
per fubftance of which to make fuch an hygrometer.  
  
Such an inftrument, you, my dear fir, though without  
intending it, have made for me; and I, without defiring  
or expecting it, have received from you. It is therefore  
with propriety that I addrefs to you the following account  
of it; and the more, as you have both a head to contrive  
and a hand to executethe means of perfecting it. AndI  
do this with greater pleafure, as it affords me the oppor-  
tunity of renewing that antient correfpondence and ac-  
quaintance with you, which to me was always fo pleafing  
and fo inftructive.  
  
You may poflibly remember, that in or about the year  
1758, you made for me a fet of artificial magnets, fix in  
number, each five and a half inches long, half an inch  
broad, and one eighth of aninch thick. Thefe, with two  
  
| = s pieces  
  
  
  
On HYGROMETERS, 53  
  
pieces of foft iron, which together equalled one of the  
magnets, were inclofed in a little box of mahogany wood,  
the grain of which ran with, and not acrofs, the length of  
the box ; and the box was clofed by a little thutter of the  
fame wood, the grain of which ran acrofs the box; and  
the ends of this fhutting piece were bevelled fo.as to fit and  
flide in a kind of dovetail groove when the box was to be  
fhut or opened.  
  
I had been of opinion that good mahogany wood was:  
not affected by moifture fo as to change its dimenfions,  
and that it was always to be found as the tools of the  
workman left it. Indeed the difference at different times  
in the fame country, is fo {mall as to be fcarcely in a com-  
mon way obfervable. Hence the box which was made fo  
as to allow fufficient room for the magnets to flide out and  
  
‘in freely, and, when in, afforded them fo much play that  
by fhaking the box one could make them ftrike the op-  
pofite fides alternately, continued in the fame ftate all the  
time I remained in England, which was four years, with-:  
out any apparent alteration. I left England in Auguft  
1762, and arrived at Philadelphia in October the fame  
year. In a few weeks after my arrival, being defirous of  
fhowing your magnets to a philofophical friend, I found  
them fo tight in the box, that it was with difficulty I got  
them out; and conftantly during the two years I remain-  
ed there, viz. till November 1764, this difficulty of get-  
ting them out and in continued. The little fhutter too,  
as wood does not fhrink length ways of the grain, was.  
found too long to enter its grooves, and not being ufed,  
was miflaid and loft; and I afterwards had another made  
that fitted.  
  
In December 1764 I returned to England, and after fome  
time I obferved that my box was become full big enough  
for my magnets, and too wide for my new fhutter; which  
was fo much too fhort for its grooves, that it was wr to  
  
all  
  
  
  
54 On HYGROMETERS.  
  
fall out; and to make it keep in, I lengthened it by adding  
to each end a little coat of fealing-wax.  
  
I continued in England more than ten years, and during  
all that time after the firft change, I perceived no alteration.  
‘The magnets had the fame freedom in their box, and the  
little fhutter continued with the added fealing-wax to fit  
its grooves, till fome weeks after my fecond return to A-  
merica.  
  
As I could not imagine any other caufe for this change  
of dimenfions in the box, when in the different countries,  
I concluded, firft generally that the air of England was  
moifter than that of America. And this I fuppofed an ef-  
fect of its being an ifland, where every wind that blew  
muft neceflarily pafs over fome fea before it arrived, and  
of courfe lick up fome vapour. I afterwards indeed doubt-  
ed whether it might be juft only fo far as related to the city  
of London, where I refided; becaufe there are many caufes  
of moifture in the city air, which do not exift to the fame  
degree in the country; fuch as the brewers and dyers  
boiling caldrons, and the great number of pots and teaket-  
tles continually on the fire, fending fourth abundance of  
vapour; and alfo the number of animals who by their  
breath continually increafe it; to which may be added,  
that even the vaft quantity of fea coals burnt there, do in  
kindling difcharge a great deal of moifture.  
  
When I was in England, the laft time, you alfo made for  
me a little achromatic pocket telefcope, the body was brafs,  
and it had a round cafe, (1 think of thin wood) covered  
with fhagrin. All the while I remained in England,  
though poflibly there might be fome {mall changes in the  
dimenfions of this cafe, I neither perceived nor fufpeéted  
any. ‘There was always comfortable room for the tele-  
{cope to flip in and out. But foon after I arrived in Ame-  
rica, which was in May 1775, the cafe became too {mall  
for the inftrument, it was with much difficulty and vari-  
ous contrivances that I got it out, and I could never after  
  
get  
  
  
  
On HYGROMETERS. 55  
  
get itin again, during my ftay there, which was eighteen  
months. I brought it with me to Europe, but left the cafe  
as ufelefs, imagining that I fhould find the continental air  
of France as dry as that of Pennfylvanta, where my mag-—  
net box had alfo returned a fecond time to its narrownefs,  
and pinched the pieces, as heretofore, obliging me too, to  
{crape the fealing-wax off the ends of the fhutter.  
  
I had not been long in France, before I was furprifed to  
find, that my box was become as large as it had always been  
_in England, the magnets entered and came out with the fame  
freedom, and, when in, I could rattle them againft its fides ;  
this has continued to be the cafe without fenfible variati-  
on. My habitation is out of Paris diftant almoft a league,  
fo that the moift air of the city cannot be fuppofed to have  
much effe&amp; upon the box. 1am on a high dry hill in a  
free air as likely to be dry as any air in France. Whence  
it feems. probable: that the air of England in general may  
as well as that of London, be moifter than the air of Ame-  
rica, fince that of France is fo, and in a part fo diftant from  
the fea.  
  
The greater drynefs of the air in America appears from  
fome other obiervations. The cabinet work formerly fent  
us from London, which confifted in thin plates of fine  
wood glued upon fir, never would fland with us, the van-  
eering, as thofe plates are called, would get loofe and-come  
off; both woods fhrinking, and their grains often crofling,  
they were forever cracking and flying. And in my elec-  
trical experiments there, it was remarkable, that a maho-  
gany table on which my jars ftood under the prime con-  
ductor to be charged, would often be fo dry, particularly  
when the wind had been fome time at north-weft which  
with us is a very drying wind, as to ifolate the jars, and  
prevent their being charged till I had formed a communi-  
cation between their coatings and the earth. I had a like  
table in London which I ufed for the fame purpofe all the  
time I relided there; but it was never fo dry as to refufe-  
conducting the eleatricity. Now.  
  
  
  
56 On HYGROMETERS.  
  
Now what I would beg leave to recommend to you, is,  
that you would recolle&amp;, if you can, the fpecies of mahoga-  
ny of which you made my box, for youknowthere is a good  
deal of difference in woods that go under that name; or  
if that cannot be, that you would take a number-of pieces  
of the clofeft and fineft grained mahogany that you can  
meet with, plane them to the thinnefs of about a line, and  
the width of about two inches acrofs the grain, and fix  
each of the pieces in fome inftrument that you can con-  
trive, which will permit them to contra and dilate, and &gt;  
will fhow, in fenfible degrees, by a moveable hand upon  
a marked {cale, the otherwife lefs fenfible quantities of fuch  
contraction and dilatation. If thefe inftruments are all  
kept in the fame place while making, and are graduated  
together while fubject to the fame degrees of moifture or  
drynefs, I apprehend you will have fo many comparable  
hygrometers, which being fent into different countries,  
and continued there for fome time, will find and fhow  
there the mean of the different drynefs and moifture of the  
air of thofe countries, and that with much lefs trouble than  
by any hygrometer hitherto in ufe.  
  
With great efteem,  
TI am, dear fir,  
Your moft obedient,  
And moft humble fervant,

in the fame country, is fo {mall as to be fcarcely in a com-  
mon way obfervable. Hence the box which was made fo  
as to allow fufficient room for the magnets to flide out and  
‘in freely, and, when in, afforded them fo much play that  
by fhaking the box one could make them ftrike the op-  
pofite fides alternately, continued in the fame ftate all the  
time I remained in England, which was four years, with-:  
out any apparent alteration. I left England in Augutft  
1762, and arrived at Philadelphia in Odtober the fame  
year. In a few weeks after my arrival, being defirous of  
fhowing your magnets to a philofophical friend, I found  
them {fo tight in the box, that it was with difficulty I got  
them out; and conftantly during the two years I remain-  
ed there, viz. till November 1764, this difficulty of get-  
ting them out and in continued. ‘The little fhutter too,  
as wood does not fhrink length ways of the grain, -was.  
found too long to enter its grooves, and not being ufed,  
was miflaid and loft; and I afterwards had another made  
that fitted.  
  
In December 1764 I returned to England, and after fome  
time I obferved that my box was become full big enough  
for my magnets, and too wide for my new fhutter; which  
was fo much too fhort for its grooves, that it was apt to

fall out; and to make it keep in, I lengthened it by adding  
to each end a little coat of fealing-wax.  
  
I continued in England more than ten years, and during  
all that time after the firft change, I perceived no alteration.  
The magnets had the fame freedom in their box, and the  
little fhutter continued with the added fealing-wax to fit  
its grooves, till fome weeks after my fecond return to A-  
merica.  
  
As I could not imagine any other caufe for this change  
of dimenfions in the box, when in the different countries,  
I concluded, firft generally that the air of England was  
moifter than that of America. And this I fuppofed an ef-  
fe&amp;t of its being an ifland, where every wind that blew  
muft neceflarily pafs over fome fea before it arrived, and  
of courfe lick up fome vapour. I afterwards indeed doubt-  
ed whether it might be juft only fo far as related to the city  
of London, where I refided; becaufe there are many caufes  
of moifture in the city air, which do not exift to the fame  
degree in the country; fuch as the brewers and dyers  
boiling caldrons, and the great number of pots and teaket-  
tles continually on the fire, fending fourth abundance of  
vapour; and alfo the number of animals who by their  
breath continually increafe it; to which may be added,  
that even the vaft quantity of fea coals burnt there, do in  
kindling difcharge a great deal of moifture.  
  
When I was in England, the laft time, you alfo made for  
me a little achromatic pocket telefcope, the body was brafs,  
and it had a round cafe, (I think of thin wood) covered  
with fhagrin. All the while I remained in England,  
though poflibly there might be fome fmall changes in the  
dimenfions of this cafe, I neither perceived nor fufpected  
any. ‘There was always comfortable room for the tele-  
{cope to flip in and out. But foon after I arrived in Ame-  
rica, which was in May 1775, the cafe became too {mall  
for the inftrument, it was with much difficulty and vari-  
ous contrivances that I got it out, and I could never after  
  
eet  
  
  
  
  
  
On HYGROMETERS. 5g  
  
get itin again, during my ftay there, which was eighteen  
months. I brought it with me to Europe, but left the cafe  
as ufelefs, imagining that I fhould find the continental air  
of France as dry as that of Pennfylvania, where my mag~  
net box had alfo returned a fecond time to its narrownefs,  
and pinched the pieces, as heretofore, obliging me too, to  
{crape the fealing-wax off the ends of the fhutter.  
  
I had not been long in France, before I was furprifed to  
find, that my box was become as large as it had always been  
in England, the magnets entered and came out with the fame  
freedom, and, when in, I could rattle them againft its fides ;  
this has continued to be the cafe without fenfible variati-  
on. My habitation is out of Paris diftant almoft a league,  
fo that the moift air of the city cannot be fuppofed to have  
much effe&amp; upon the box. 1am on a high dry hill in a  
free air as likely to be dry as any air in France. Whence  
it feems. probable. that the air of England in general may  
as well as that of London, be moifter than the air of Ame-  
rica, fince that of France is fo, and in a part fo diftant from  
the fea.  
  
The greater drynefs of the air in America appears front  
fome other obiervations. The cabinet work formerly fent  
us from London, which confifted in thin plates of fine  
wood glued upon fir, never would fland with us, the van-  
eering, as thofe plates are called, would get loofe and-come  
off; both woods fhrinking, and their grains often crofling,.  
they were forever cracking and flying. And in my elec-  
trical experiments there, it was remarkable, that a maho-  
gany table on which my jars ftood under the prime con-  
ductor to be charged, would often be fo dry, particularly  
when the wind had been fome time at north-weft which  
with us is a very drying wind, as to ifolate the jars, and  
prevent their being charged till 1 had formed a communi-  
cation between their coatings and the earth. I had a like  
table in London which I ufed for the fame purpofe all the  
time I refided there; but it was never fo dry as to refufe-  
conducting the electricity. Now.

Now what I would beg leave to recommend to you, is,  
that you would recolle&amp;, if you can, the fpecies of mahoga-  
ny of which you made my box, for youknowthere isa good  
deal of difference in woods that go under that name; or  
if that cannot be, that you would take a number-of pieces  
of the clofeft and fineft grained mahogany that you can  
meet with, plane them to the thinnefs of about a line, and  
the width of about two inches acrofs the grain, and fix  
each of the pieces in fome inftrument that you can con-  
trive, which will permit them to contra&amp; and dilate, and  
will fhow, in fenfible degrees, by a moveable hand upon  
a marked fcale, the otherwife lefs fenfible quantities of fuch  
contraction and dilatation. If thefe inftruments are all  
kept in the fame place while making, and are graduated  
together while fubjeé to the fame degrees of moifture or  
drynefs, I apprehend you will have fo many comparable  
hygrometers, which being fent into different countries,  
and continued there for fome time, will find and fhow  
there the mean of the different drynefs and moifture of the  
air of thofe countries, and that with much lefs trouble than  
by any hygrometer hitherto in ufe.  
  
With great efteem,

fhe qualities hitherto fought in  
a hygrometer, ox inftrument to  
difcover the degrees of moifture and  
drynefs in the air, feem to have  
been, an aptitude to receive humi-  
dity readily from a moift air, and  
to part with it as readily to a dry  
air. Different fubftances have been  
found to poffefs more or lefs of this  
  
vality; but when we fhall have  
found the fubftance that has it in  
  
the greateft perfeftion, ‘there will  
{till remain fome uncertainty in the  
conclufions to be drawn from the —  
degree fhown by the inftrument, ~  
arifing from the a€tual ftate of the  
in{trument itfelf as to heat and cold,  
Thus, if two bottles or veffels of  
glafs or metal being filled, the one  
with cold and the other with hot”  
water, are brought into a room, the”  
moifture of the air in the rdom™  
will  
  
  
  
Se a Ruane Ve  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
On Hygrometers,  
  
will attach itfelf in quantities to the  
furface of the cold veffel, while if  
you actually wet the furface of the  
hot. veffel, the moifture will im-  
mediately quit it, and be abforbed  
by the fame air. And thus in a  
fudden change of the air from cold  
to warm, the inftrument ss  
longer cold may condenfe an  
  
abforb more moifture, and mark  
the air as having become more  
humid than it is in reality, and the  
contrary in a change from warm to  
  
ld.  
  
But if fuch a fuddenly changing  
infrument could be freed from  
thefe imperfettions, yet when the  
defign is to difcover the different  
degrees of humidity in the air of  
different countries, I apprehend  
the quick fenfibility of the inftru-  
ment to be rather a difadvantage ;  
fince, to draw the defired conclufions  
from it, a conftant and frequent  
dblervation day and night in each  
country will be neceffary for a year  
ot years, and the mean of each  
different fet of obfervations is to be  
found and determined. After all  
which fome uncertainty will remain  
refpetting the different degrees of  
exattitude with which different  
perfons may have made and taken  
notes of their obfervations. ;  
  
For thefe reaforis, I apprehend  
that a fubftance which, though ca-  
pable of beirig diftended by moifture  
and contraéted by*drynefs, is fo  
flow in receiving and parting with  
its hamidity, that the frequent  
changes in the atmofphere have not  
time to affeét it fenfibly, and which  
therefore fhould gradually take  
tiearly the medium of all thofe  
changes and preférve it coriftantly,  
would be the moft eg fubftance  
of which to make fuch an hygro-  
mheter, :  
  
Such ari inftrumerit, you, miy  
dear fir, though without intending  
it, have miade for me; and I, with-  
out defiring ar expecting it, have  
received from you. It is therefore  
with propriety that I addrefs to you  
the following account of it; and  
  
VoL, X,  
  
249  
  
the more, as you have both a head  
to contrive and a hand to execute  
the means of perfeéting it. And I  
do this with greater pleafure, as it  
affords me the opportunity of res  
newing that ancient correfponderce  
and acquaintance with you, which  
to me was always fo pleafing and fo  
inftru€tive. :  
  
You may poflibly remember;  
that in or about the year 1758, you  
made for me a fet of artificial mag  
nets, fix iri number, each five and 4  
half inches long, half an inch  
broad, and one eighth of an inch  
thick. Thefe, with two pieces of  
foft iron, which together equalled  
one of the magnets, were inclofed  
in a little box of mahogany wood,  
the grain of which ran with, and  
not.acrofs, the length of the box ;.  
and the box was clofed by a little  
fhutter of the fame wood, the grain  
of which ran acrofs the box; and  
the ends of this fhutting piece were  
bevelled fo as to fit and flide in a,  
kind of dovetail groove when thé  
box was to be fhut or opened.  
  
I had been of opinion that good  
mahogany wood was not affected  
by moifture fo as to change its  
dimienfiohs, and that it was always  
to be found as the tools of the  
workmen left it. Indeed the dif  
ference at different times in the  
fame country, is fo {mail as to be  
fcarcely in a common way obferva  
able. Hence the box which was  
made fo as&#x27;to allow fufficient room  
for the magnets to flide out and in  
freely, and, when in, afforded them  
fo much play that by fhaking the  
box one could make them ftrike  
the oppofite fides alternately, con  
tinued in the fame ftaté all the time  
I rémainied in England, which was  
four years, without any apparent  
alteration. I left England in Auguft  
1762, and arrived at Philadelphia  
in Oétober the fame year. In a few  
weeks after my arrival, being de-  
firous of fhowing your magnets to a  
philofophical friend, I found them  
{fo tight in the box, that it was with  
difficulty I got them out; and con-  
  
li ftantly  
  
  
  
250  
ftantly during the two years I re-  
mained there, viz. till November  
1764, this difficulty of getting them  
out and in continued. The little  
fhutter too, as wood does not fhrink  
Tengthways of the grain, was found  
too long to enter its grooves, and  
not being ufed, was miflaid and loft;  
and I afterwards had another made  
that fitted.  
  
‘In December 1764 I returned to  
England, and after fome time I ob-  
ferved that my box was become  
full big enough for my magnets,  
and too wide for my new fhutter ;  
which was fo much too fhort for its  
grooves, that it was apt to fall out;  
and to make it keep in, I lengthened  
it by adding to each end a little  
coat of fealing-wax.  
  
I continued in England more than  
ten years, and during all that time  
after the firft change, I perccived  
no alteration. The magnets had  
the fame freedom in their box, and  
the little fhutter continued with the  
added fealing-wax to fit its grooves,  
till fome weeks after my fecond re-  
turn to America,  
  
As I could not imagine any other  
caufe for this change of dimenfions  
in the box, when in the different  
countries, I concluded, firft gene-  
rally that the air of England was  
moitter than that of America. And  
this I {uppoied an effe&amp; of its being  
an ifland, where every wind that  
blew muft neceffarily pafs over  
fome fea before it arrived, and of  
courfe lick up fome vapour. I  
afterwards indeed doubted whether  
it might be juft only fo far as re-  
lated to the city of London, where  
I refided; becaufe there are many  
caufes of moifture in the city air,  
which do not exift to the fame  
degree in the country; fuch as the  
brewers and dyers boiling caldrons,  
and the great number of pots and  
tea kettles continually on the fire,  
fending forth abundance of va-  
pour; and alfo the number of  
animals who by their breath con-  
tinually increafe it; to which may  
  
be added, that even the vaft quan-  
  
On Hygrometers..  
  
tity of {ca coals burnt there, do in  
kindling difcharge a great deal of  
moifture.  
  
When I was in England, the laft  
time, you alfo made for me a little  
achromatic pocket telefcope, the  
body was brafs, and it had a round  
cafe, (I think ef thin wood) covered  
with fhagrin, All the while I re-  
mained in England, though pofibly  
there might be fome fmall changes  
in the dimenfions of this cafe, I  
neither perceived nor fufpeéted  
any, There was always comfortable  
room for the telefcope to flip in and  
out. But foon after I arrived in  
America, which was in May 1775,  
the cafe became too {mall for the  
inftrument, it was with much dif-  
ficulty and various contrivances  
that I got it out, and I could never  
after get it in again, during my ftay  
there, which was eighteen months,  
I brought it with me to Europe,  
but left the cafe as ufelefs, imagining  
that I fhould find the continential  
air of France as dry as that of  
Pennfylvania, where my magnet  
box had alfo returned a fecond  
time to its narrownefs, and pinched  
the pieces, as heretofore, obliging  
me too, to fcrape the fealing-wax  
off the ends of the fhutter.

without fenfible variation, My ha-

I am on a high dry hill ina free

that the air of England in general

America appears from fome other  
obfervations, The cabinet work  
formerly fent us from London,  
which confifted in thin plates of  
fine wood glued upon fir, never  
would ftand with us, the vaneering,  
as thofe plates are called, would  
get loofe and come off ; both woods  
fhrinking, and their grains often  
crofling, they were for ever cracking  
and flying. And in my eleéttrical  
experiments there, it was remark-  
able, that a mahogany table on  
which my jars ftood under the  
prime conduétor to be charged,  
would often be fo dry, particularly  
when the wind had been fome time  
at north-weft, which with us is a  
very drying wind, as to ifolate the  
jats, and prevent their being charged  
till 1 had formed a communication  
between their coatings and the  
earth, I had alike table in London  
which I ufed for the fame purpofe  
all the time I refided there; but it  
was never fo dry as to refufe con-  
dutting the electricity.  
  
Now what I would beg leave to  
recommend to you, is, that you  
would recolle&amp;, if you can, the  
fpecies of mahogany of which you  
  
On Hygrometers.  
  
  
  
25%  
  
made my box, for you know there  
is a good deal of difference in woods  
that go under that name; or if that  
cannot be, that you would take a  
number of pieces of the clofeft and  
fineft grained mahogany that you  
can meet with, plane them to the  
thinnefs of about a line, and the  
width of about two inches acrofs  
the grain, and fix each of the pieces  
in fome inftrument that you can  
contrive, which will permit them to  
contraé and dilate, and will fhow,  
in fenfible degrees, by a moveable  
hand upon a marked {fcale, the  
otherwile lefs fenfible quantities of  
fuch contra&amp;ion and dilatation.  
If thefe inftruments are all kept in  
the fame place while making, and  
are graduated together while fub-  
jeét to the fame degrees of moifturé  
or drynefs, I apprehend you will  
have fo many comparable hygrome-  
ters, which being {ent into different  
countries, and continued there for  
fome time, will find and fhow there  
the mean of the different drynefs  
and moifture of the air of thofe  
countries, and that with much lefs  
trouble than by any hygrometer  
hitherto in ufe.
