Letter from Dr Franklin to Genl Washington  
  
II.  
Sir,  
Paris, June 13. 1777.  
The Bearer M. le Comte Kotkouski, a Polish Officer, is recommended to me by several Persons of Worth here; as a Man of Experience in Military Affairs and of tried Bravery: He has lost his Family and Estate in Poland by fighting there in the Cause of Liberty; and wishes by engaging in the same Cause to find a new Country and new Friends in America. Count Pulaski, who was a General of the Confederates in Poland, and who is gone to join you, is esteemed one of the Greatest Officers in Europe: He can give you the Character of this M. Kotkouski, who served under him as Lieutenant Colonel. It is with regret that I give Letters of Introduction to Foreign Officers, fearing you may be troubled with more than you can provide for or employ to their and your own Satisfaction. When particular Cases seem to have a Claim to such Letters, I hope you will excuse my taking the Liberty: I give no Expectations to those who apply for them; I promise nothing; I acquaint them that their being plac’d when they arrive is a great Uncertainty, and that the Voyage being long, expensive and hazardous, I counsel them not to undertake it. This honest Gentleman’s Zeal is not to be discourag’d by such Means: he determines to go, and serve as a Volunteer if he cannot be employ’d immediately as an Officer: But I wish and hope your Excellency may find a better Situation for him and that he will be an useful Officer. He has the Advantage of understanding English and will soon speak it intelligibly. He also speaks German and some other European Languages and the Latin. With the truest Esteem and Respect I have the Honour to
