This is the true political Idea, that every Writer on these Subjects should have in View. Most of them think only of the good of a Part, Britain.  
The writer lives in the country, and has not kept up with the pamphlet controversy on the American question; he may therefore be repeating inadvertently some ideas of others. “The good of the whole British empire is what he aims at: the colonies of course must come into consideration; which has obliged him to hasten his work, that it may be printed before the parliament decides what shall be done in regard to them.”  
  
In what Degree?  
Members of the House of Commons represent the public at large, not their particular constituencies. “We may conceive them to be (in a certain degree) the representatives and guardians

The Care and Labour of providing for artificial and fashionable Wants, the Sight of so many Rich wallowing in superfluous Plenty, whereby so many are kept poor distress’d by Want: The Insolence of Office, the Snares and Plagues of Law, the Restraints of Custom, all contribute to disgust them with what we call civil Society.  
In the present disputes about liberty, it is important to understand the meaning of the word. The benefits we derive from society are apparent only when we lose them, but reflection will show us “the happiness we enjoy beyond what is attainable by solitary savages.” The

What ancient Laws? Probably Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights, Petition of Right, &amp;c. This Author supposes the Colonists want a new Parliament in order to have the Duties taken off. He is mistaken. They did petition; they were not heard, and they will petition no more. They have taken their Measures. Keep up your Duties, if you please; they will not pay them, because they will not use the Commodities. And because they think you use them ill in laying such Duties, they will manufacture for themselves. They now find they gain and save infinitely more by your Continuing the Duties, than they should by your repealing them.

Nore. The further they extend themselves, the less likely  
to be too populous, so as to engage in manufactures: but no dis-  
tance they can go from the sea, will add much by carriage to the  
price of British goods. The country is full of rivers and lakes;

Nore. It is great impudence or folly in a man to suppose  
that, because he is an Englishman, every American owes him  
allegiance. If every Englishman is not a sovereign over every  
American, neither can he communicate such sovereignty to ano-  
ther, by choosing him parliament man.

Franklin. This is a vague expression.  
Writers like the above confound themselves  
and their readers with the idea that the British  
Empire is but one State; not considering or  
knowing that it consists of many States under  
one sovereign.

tain may provide and protect establishments of  
her subjects in foreign parts for the advantage  
of said subjects personally, but cannot make  
any foreign settlement for her own advantage.
