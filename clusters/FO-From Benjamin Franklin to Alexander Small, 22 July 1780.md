I forgot to acquaint you [he told his friend Dr.  
Small] that I had treated it (my gout) a little  
cavalierly in its last two accesses. Finding one  
night that my foot gave me more pain after it  
was covered warm in bed, I put it out of bed  
naked; and, perceiving it easier, I let it remain  
longer than I at first designed, and at length fell  
asleep, leaving it there till morning. The pain did  
not return, and I grew well. Next winter, having  
a second attack, I repeated the experiment; not  
with such immediate success in dismissing the  
gout, but constantly with the effect of rendering  
it less painful, so that it permitted me to sleep  
every night. I should mention that it was my  
son who gave me the first intimation of this prac-  
tice. He being in the old opinion, that the gout  
was to be drawn out by transpiration; and having  
heard me say, that perspiration was carried on more  
copiously when the body was naked than when  
clothed, he put his foot out of bed to increase that  
discharge, and found ease by it, which he thought  
a confirmation of the doctrine. But this method re-  
quires to be confirmed by more experiments, before  
one can conscientiously recommend it.
