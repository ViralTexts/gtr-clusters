12 Puivapetruia, Nov. 8, 1753.  
Dear Sir,  
  
Tue first intimation I find of the new air-pump, is ina  
piece of Mr. Watson’s, read to the Royal Society, Feb. 20,  
1752, where describing some experiments he made in va-  
cuo, he says—“ The more complete the vacuum, ceteris  
— the more considerable were the effects; and here,  
  
should not do justice to real merit, were I silent in regard  
to Mr. Sweaton. This gentleman, with a genius truly me-  
chanical, which enables him to give to such philosophical  
instruments as he executes, a degree of perfection scarce  
to be found elsewhere ; this gentleman, I say, has construc

Boyle’s vacuum much more perfect than heretofore. By a  
well conducted experiment, which admits of no doubt as to  
its truth, I have seen by this pump the air rarified to 1000

but it appears to me that the machine being rather simpli-
