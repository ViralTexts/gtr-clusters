INSECT STINGS.<br/>
<br/>
[is pain caused by the sting of a plant or<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
insect is the result of a certain amount of<br/>
acid poison injected into the blood. The<br/>
first thing to be done is to press the tube of a smal!<br/>
key from side to side, to facilitate the expulsion<br/>
of the sting and its accompanying poisen. The<br/>
<br/>
| sting, if left in the wound, should be carefully<br/>
<br/>
extracted ; otherwise it will greatly increase the<br/>
local irritation. The poison of stings being acid,<br/>
<br/>
| common sense points to the alkalies as the proper<br/>
<br/>
means of cure. Among the most easily procured<br/>
remedies may be mentioned soft soap, liquor of<br/>
ammonia (spirits of hartshorn), smelling-salts,<br/>
washing-soda, quicklime made into a paste with<br/>
water, the juice of an onion, tobacco juice, chewed<br/>
<br/>
| tobacco, bruised dock leaves, tomato juice, wood<br/>
<br/>
ashes, tobacco ashes and carbonate of soda. If<br/>
<br/>
| the sting be severe, rest and coolness should be<br/>
<br/>
added to the other remedies, more especially in<br/>
the case of nervous subjects. Nothing is so apt to<br/>
make the poison active as heat, and nothing<br/>
favors its activity less than cold. Let the body<br/>
be kept cool and at rest, and the activity of the<br/>
<br/>
| poison will be reduced to a minimum, Any<br/>
<br/>
active exertion whereby the circulation is quick-<br/>
ened will increase both pain and swelling. If the<br/>
swelling be severe, the part may be rubbed with<br/>
sweet oil or a drop or two of laudanum. Stings<br/>
in the eye, ear, mouth or throat sometimes lead<br/>
to serious consequences; in such cases medical<br/>
advice should always be sought as soon as pos-<br/>
<br/>
sible.</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/sim_arthurs-home-magazine_1881-09_49_9$21/pct:57.621951,46.865443,35.175305,42.533129/,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />
