I received duly yours of the 2d Inst. I am sorry you have had so much Trouble in the Affair of the Prisoners. You have been deceived as well as we. No Cartel Ship has yet appear’d. And it is now evident that the Delays have been of Design, to give more Opportunity of seducing the Men by Promises and Hardships, to seek their Liberty in engaging against their Country. For we learn from those who have escaped, that there are Persons continually employed in cajoling &amp; menacing them, representing to them that we neglect them, that your Government is willing to exchange them, and that it is our Fault it is not done: That all the News from America is bad on their Side; we shall be conquer’d and they will be hang’d, if they do not accept the gracious Offer of being Pardon’d on Condition of serving the King, &amp;c. A great Part of your Prisoners have been kept these Six Months on board a Ship in Brest Road, ready to be delivered; where I am afraid they were not so comfortably accommodated as they might have been in the french Prisons. They are now order’d on Shore.

Journal. Franklin wrote from France to David Hartley, March 21,1779: ‘1am sorry  
you have had so much trouble in the affair of the prisoners. You have been deceived as  
well as I. No cartel ship has yet appeared; and it is now evident that the delays have been  
of design, to give more opportunity of seducing the men by promises and hardships to

senting to them that we neglect them; that your government is willing to exchange them ;  
and that it is our fault it is not done; that all the news from America is bad on their  
side ; we shall be conquered and they will be hanged, if they do not accept the gracious  
offer of being pardoned on condition of serving the king, &amp;c. A great part of your prison-

1 On the efforts of the English to enlist the American sailors, Frank-  
lin, writing to David Hartley in 1779, says, “No cartel has yet ap-  
peared; and it is now evident that the delays have been of design, to  
give more opportunity of seducing the men by promises and hardships  
to seek their liberty in engaging against their country; for we learn  
from those who have escaped that there are persons continually em-  
ployed in cajoling and menacing them; representing to them that we  
neglect them; that your government is willing to exchange them; and  
that it is our fault it is not done; that all the news from America is bad  
on their side; we shall be conquered and they will be hanged, if they do  
not accept the gracious offer of being pardoned on condition of serving  
the King, &amp;c.”—Diplomatic Correspondence.
