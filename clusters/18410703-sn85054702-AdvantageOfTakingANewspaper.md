The following exhibits the genius and talent of a true poet, of one who is destined to render himself immortal by his inspirations. There is a moral to it, an inspiration, which should stir up the soul of very liberal minded and intelligent beings:—*Boston Transcript*.  
  
I knew two friends, as much alike    
As e&#x27;er you saw two stumps;  
And no phrenologist could find  
A difference in their bumps.  
  
One took the papers, and his life  
Was happier than a king&#x27;s;  
His children all can read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
  
The other took no papers, and  
While strolling through the wood,  
A tree fell down upon his crown,  
And hurt him, as it should!  
  
Had he been reading of the news  
At home, like neighbor Jim,  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent this accident  
Would not befallen him!

**Take the Paper**  
  
We find the following going the rounds of the press. Read, ponder, and—PAY UP! Why don&#x27;t you take the papers? they&#x27;re the life of my delight, except about election time, and then I read for spite. Subscribe, you cannot loose a cent, why should you be afraid? for cash thus spent is money lent at interest, four-fold paid. Go, then, and take the papers, and pay to-day, nor pay delay, and my word it is inferred, you&#x27;ll live until you&#x27;re gray. An old neighbor of mine, while dying of a cough, desired to hear the latest news while he was going off. I took the paper and I read of some new pills in force; he bought a box—and is he dead? no—hearty as a horse. I knew two men as much alike as e&#x27;er you saw two stumps; and no phrenologist could find a difference in their bumps. One takes the paper and his life is happier than a king&#x27;s, his children can all read and write, and talk of men and things. The other took no paper, and, while strolling through the wood, a tree fell down and broke his crown, and killed him—&quot;very good.&quot; Had he been reading all the news, at home like his neighbor Jim, I&#x27;ll be a cent that accident would not have happened him, for he who takes the paper, and pays his bill when due, can live in peace with every man, and with the printer too.

Next morning she was at her work,

WHY DON&#x27;T YOU TAKE THE PAPERS!&quot;  
BY GEORGE B. WILLIS.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the paper!  
They are &quot;the life of my delight;&quot;  
Except about diction times,  
And then I read fur spite.  
Subscribe, you cannot lose a cent,  
Depend tho advice i good;  
For cash thus spent is money lent  
On interest four fold paid.  
My grandad used to make his brsjs  
Of living at a day  
When papers sold as chnnpas rags,&quot;  
And trust was took for pay.  
My grandma, when she had the blue,  
Would thank her gracious stars  
That papers filled with wholesome news  
Were scattered every wraes.  
I knew two friends, as much alike  
As e&#x27;er you saw two stumps;  
And no phrenel -gist could find  
A difference in theirburr.ps.  
E&#x27;ich had a farm of equal worth,  
A pretty wife to keep  
Throe boys three horses snd a cow,  
A dog and twenty sheep.  
One took the papers, and his lifo  
Is happier than a Kir.g&quot;s;  
His children all can read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
The other took no paper, and  
While strolling through the wood,  
A tree full down upon his crown,  
And killed him as it shoull.  
Had he been reading of the&quot;nc.TJ,&quot;  
At home, like neighbor Jim,  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent thai accident

Go then, and take the paper,  
And pay to diy, nor pray delay,

An old news-monger friend of mine,  
While dying from a cough,  
Desired to hear the latest news,  
While he was goirg off.  
I tonlt tho popor, and I read  
Of some new pills in force;  
He bought a box and is he dead?  
No! hearty as a hor?e.  
I knew a printer&#x27;s debtor once,  
Racked with a scorching fever,  
Who swore to pay her bill next day,  
If her diseaee woulj leave her.  
Next morning she was at her work,  
Divested of her pain;  
But did forget to pay her dolt,  
Till talteu down agiu.  
Here, Jesse, take the;? silver wheels,

She spoke, she slept, and then awoke.  
With health upon her brow.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the papers,  
Nor from the printer&#x27;s visage sr.eak,  
Because you borrow of his boy,  
A paper every week.  
For he who takes the p&#x27;ipcM,  
And pays his bill when it is due,

His children all could read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
  
The other took no paper—and F|  
While strolling through a wood,  
  
A tree fell down upon his crown,  
And killed him—as it should.  
  
Had he been reading of the news  
At home, like neighbor Jim,  
  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent that accident  
Would never have happened him.

Why don&#x27;t You take the Paper ?  
  
BY N. P. WILLIS.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the paper ?  
They’re the life of ray delight :  
Except about election time.  
And then I read for spite.  
An old newspaper friend of mine,  
While dying from a cough,  
Desired to hoar the latest news  
While he was going off.  
I took the paper and I road  
Of some new pill in force !  
lie bought a box—and is he dead •  
No—hardy as a horse.  
I knew a printer’s debtor ouco.  
Racked with scorching fever ;  
She swore she’d pay her bill next day  
If her distress would leave her.  
Next morning she was at her work,  
Divested of her pain,  
Bui she forgot to pay her debt,  
Till taken down again.  
‘‘Here, Jessie, take these silver wheels,  
Go pay the printer now !’•*  
She spoke and slept, and then awoke  
With health upon her brow.  
I knew two men as much alike  
As e’er you saw two stumps.  
And no phrenologist could find  
A difference in their bumps.  
One took the papers, and his life  
Is happier than a king’s ;  
His children all can read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
Hie other took no paper, and  
While strolling through the wood,  
A tree fell down upon his crown  
And killed him “werry good.”  
Had h* been reading of the news  
At home like neighbor Jim,  
I’ll bet a cent that accident  
Would not have happened him.  
Why don’t you take the papers ?  
Nor from the printer sneak,  
Because you borrow from his boy  
A paper every weak.  
For he who takes the paper,  
And pays his bill when due,  
Can liva in peace with God and man,  
And with the printer, too.

Why don&#x27;t you take the papers?  
They&#x27;re the life of my delight;  
Except about election time,  
And then I read for spite.  
Subscribe, you cannot lose a cent--  
Why should you be afraid?

On interest, four fold paid.  
Go then and take the papers,  
And pay to-day nor pay delay,  
And my word it is inferred,  
You&#x27;ll live till you are gray.  
An old newspaper friend of mine,  
While dying from a cough,  
Desired to hear the latest news,  
While he was dying off.  
I took the paper, and I read  
Of some new Pills in force;  
He bought a box, and is he dead?  
No--hearty as a horse.  
I knew a printer&#x27;s debtor once,  
Racked with a scorching fever,  
Who swore to pay her debt next day,  
If her distress wolud leave her.  
Next morning she was at her work,  
Divested of her pain,  
But did forget to pay her debt,  
Till taken down again.  
Here, Jessie, take these silver wheels,  
And pay the printer now!&quot;  
She slept and slept, and then awoke,  
With health upon her brow.  
I knew two men, as much alike  
102. As e&#x27;er you saw two stumps;  
And no phrenologist could find  
A difference in their bumps.  
One takes the paper, and his life  
Is happier than a king&#x27;s;  
His children can read and writ­  
$981 And talk of men and things­  
The other took no paper, and  
While strolling through the wood,  
A tree fell down and broke his crown,  
And killed him, &quot;very good.&quot;  
Had he been reading of the news,  
dfial At home, like neighbor Jim,  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent that accident  
Would not have happened him.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the papers?  
Nor from the printer sneak,  
Because you borrow of his boy  
20A paper every week.  
For he who takes the papers,  
And pays his bills when due,  
Can live in peace witn God and man,  
And with the printer too.

TAKE TIIE PAPERS.  
BY X. P. WILLIS.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the paper?  
They’re the life of my delight;  
Except about election- time,  
And then I read for spite.  
Subscribe ! you cannot lose a cent,  
Why should you be afraid ;  
For cash thus paid, is money lent,  
On interest fourfold paid.  
• •  
Go then and take the papers,&#x27;  
And pay to-day, nor pay delay:  
And my word, for it is inferred,  
You&#x27;ll live until you are gray.  
. L  
An old neighbor of mine,  
While dying with a cough,  
Desired to hear the latest news  
While he was going off.  
I took the paper and I read  
Of some new pills in force ;  
He bought a box—and is he dead ?  
No—heartier than a horse.  
I know two men, as much alike.  
As e&#x27;er you saw two stumps.  
And no phrenologist could find  
A difference in their bumps.  
One takes the papers, and his life  
Is happier than a king&#x27;s,  
His children all can read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
The other took no paper, and  
While strolling through the wood.  
A tree fell down and broke his crown,  
And killed Mm: “very good,&quot;  
Had he been reading of ihe news,  
At home like neighbor Jim,  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent that accident  
Would not have happened him.  
Why don’t you take the papers,  
Nor from the printer sneak,  
Because you borrow of his boy,  
A paper every week.  
For he who takes the papers.  
And pays his bills when due,  
Can live in peace with God and man.  
And with the printer too.

THE PAPERS.  
BY N. r. WillIs.  
  
Why don&#x27;t you take the paper?  
They&#x27;re the life of my delight;  
Except about election time,  
And then I read for spite.  
Subscribe! you cannot lose a cent,  
Why should you be afraid;  
For cash thus pald is money lent,  
On interest fourlold paid.  
Go then and take the papers,  
And pay to-day, tlor pay delay,  
And my word for it is inferred,  
You&#x27;ll live untll you are gray.  
An old neighbor of mine,  
While dying with a cough,  
Desired to hear the latest news  
While he was going off.  
I took the paper and I read  
Of some new pills in force;  
He bought a bex--aod is he dead?  
Ne--heartier than a horss.  
I know two men, as much alike,  
As e&#x27;er you saw two stumps,  
And no phrenologist could fnd  
  
And no phrenologist could find  
A difference in their bumps.  
One takes the paper, and his life  
Is happier than a king&#x27;s,  
His children all can read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
Ths other took no paper, and  
While strolling through the weod,  
A tree fell down and broke his cretn,  
And killed him; &quot;very goed.&quot;  
Had he been reading of the news,  
At home like neighbor Jim,  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent that accident  
Would not have happened him.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the papers,  
  
Fer from the printer sueak,  
Because you borrow of your neighbor,  
The paper every week.  
For he who takes the papers,  
And pay his bills when due,  
Can live in peace with God and man,  
And with the printer too.

Why don&#x27;t you take the papere?  
Nor from the printer sneak,

the following for publication, thinking  
it might be interesting to some of our  
numerous readers. It is from the Irish  
MonthlU magazine, and the lines are  
prefaced thus: -&quot; I know not whence has  
come this lyric on &#x27;The vital advantage  
of t&#x27;king a paper. The same reason  
applies to, mnagazines :I knew two  
friends as much alike As e&#x27;eryou saw tw7

difference in their bumps. One took a
