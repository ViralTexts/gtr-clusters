The following exhibits the genius and talent of a true poet, of one who is destined to render himself immortal by his inspirations. There is a moral to it, an inspiration, which should stir up the soul of very liberal minded and intelligent beings:—*Boston Transcript*.  
  
I knew two friends, as much alike    
As e&#x27;er you saw two stumps;  
And no phrenologist could find  
A difference in their bumps.  
  
One took the papers, and his life  
Was happier than a king&#x27;s;  
His children all can read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
  
The other took no papers, and  
While strolling through the wood,  
A tree fell down upon his crown,  
And hurt him, as it should!  
  
Had he been reading of the news  
At home, like neighbor Jim,  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent this accident  
Would not befallen him!
