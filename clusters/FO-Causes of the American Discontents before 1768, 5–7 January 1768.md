The Waves never rise but when the Winds blow. Prov.  
Sir,  
As the cause of the present ill humour in America, and of the resolutions taken there to purchase less of our manufactures, does not seem to be generally understood, it may afford some satisfaction to your Readers, if you give them the following short historical state of facts.  
From the time that the Colonies were first considered as capable of granting aids to the Crown, down to the end of the last war, it is said, that the constant mode of obtaining those aids was by Requisition made from the Crown through its Governors to the several Assemblies, in circular letters from the Secretary of State in his Majesty’s name, setting forth the occasion, requiring them to take the matter into consideration; and expressing a reliance on their prudence, duty and affection to his Majesty’s Government, that they would grant such sums, or raise such numbers of men, as were suitable to their respective circumstances.  
The Colonies being accustomed to this method, have from time to time granted money to the Crown, or raised troops for its service, in proportion to their abilities; and during all the last war beyond their abilities, so that considerable sums were return’d them yearly by Parliament, as they had exceeded their proportion.  
Had this happy method of Requisition been continued, (a method that left the King’s subjects in those remote countries the pleasure of showing their zeal and loyalty, and of imagining that they recommended themselves to their Sovereign by the liberality of their voluntary grants) there is no doubt but all the money that could reasonably be expected to be rais’d from them in any manner, might have been obtained, without the least heart-burning, offence, or breach of the harmony, of affections and interests, that so long subsisted between the two countries.  
It has been thought wisdom in a Government exercising sovereignty over different kinds of people, to have some regard to prevailing and established opinions among the people to be governed, wherever such opinions might in their effects obstruct or promote publick measures. If they tend to obstruct publick service, they are to be changed, if possible, before we attempt to act against them; and they can only be changed by reason and persuasion. But if publick business can be carried on without thwarting those opinions, if they can be, on the contrary, made subservient to it, they are not unnecessarily to be thwarted, how absurd soever such popular opinions may be in their natures. This had been the wisdom of our Government with respect to raising money in the Colonies. It was well known, that the Colonies universally were of opinion, that no money could be levied from English subjects, but by their own consent given by themselves or their chosen Representatives: That therefore whatever money was to be raised from the people in the Colonies, must first be granted by their Assemblies, as the money raised in Britain is first to be granted by the House of Commons: That this right of granting their own money, was essential to English liberty: And that if any man, or body of men, in which they had no Representative of their chusing, could tax them at pleasure, they could not be said to have any property, any thing they could call their own. But as these opinions did not hinder their granting money voluntarily and amply whenever the Crown by its servants came into their Assemblies (as it does into its Parliaments of Britain or Ireland) and demanded aids; therefore that method was chosen rather than the hateful one of arbitrary taxes.  
I do not undertake here to support these opinions of the Americans; they have been refuted by a late Act of Parliament, declaring its own power; which very Parliament, however, shew’d wisely so much tender regard to those inveterate prejudices, as to repeal a tax that had militated against them. And those prejudices are still so fixed and rooted in the Americans, that, it has been supposed, not a single man among them has been convinced of his error, even by that Act of Parliament.  
The person then who first projected to lay aside the accustomed method of Requisition, and to raise money on America by Stamps, seems not to have acted wisely, in deviating from that method (which the Colonists looked upon as constitutional) and thwarting unnecessarily the fixed prejudices of so great a number of the King’s subjects. It was not, however, for want of knowledge that what he was about to do would give them great offence; he appears to have been very sensible of this, and apprehensive that it might occasion some disorders, to prevent or suppress which, he projected another Bill, that was brought in the same Session with the Stamp Act, whereby it was to be made lawful for military Officers in the Colonies to quarter their soldiers in private houses. This seem’d intended to awe the people into a compliance with the other Act. Great opposition however being raised here against the Bill by the Agents from the Colonies, and the Merchants trading thither, the Colonists declaring, that under such a power in the Army, no one could look on his house as his own, or think he had a home, when soldiers might be thrust into it and mix’d with his family at the pleasure of an officer, that part of the Bill was dropt; but there still remained a clause, when it passed into a Law, to oblige the several Assemblies to provide quarters for the soldiers, furnishing them with firing, bedding, candles, small beer or rum, and sundry other articles, at the expence of the several Provinces. And this Act continued in force when the Stamp Act was repealed, though if obligatory on the Assemblies, it equally militated against the American principle abovementioned, that money is not to be raised on English subjects without their consent.  
The Colonies nevertheless being put into high good humour by the repeal of the Stamp Act, chose to avoid fresh dispute upon the other, it being temporary and soon to expire, never, as they hoped, to revive again; and in the meantime they, by various ways in different Colonies, provided for the quartering of the troops, either by acts of their own Assemblies, without taking notice of the A[cts] of P[arliamen]t, or by some variety or small diminution, as of salt and vinegar, in the supplies required by the Act, that what they did might appear a voluntary act of their own, and not done in obedience to an A[ct] of P[arliamen]t which, according to their ideas of their rights, they thought hard to obey.  
It might have been well if the matter had thus passed without notice; but a G[overno]r having written home an angry and aggravating letter upon this conduct in the Assembly of his Province,  the outed P[rojecto]r of the Stamp Act and his adherents then in the opposition, raised such a clamour against America, as being in rebellion, and against those who had been for the repeal of the Stamp Act, as having thereby been encouragers of this supposed rebellion, that it was thought necessary to inforce the Quartering Act by another Act of Parliament, taking away from the Province of New York, which had been the most explicit in its refusal, all the powers of legislation, till it should have complied with that act. The news of which greatly alarmed the people every where in America, as (it has been said) the language of such an act seemed to them to be, Obey implicitly laws made by the Parliament of Great Britain to raise money on you without your consent, or you shall enjoy no rights or privileges at all.  
At the same time a Person lately in high office,  projected the levying more money from America, by new duties on various articles of our own manufacture, as glass, paper, painters colours, &amp;c. appointing a new Board of Customs, and sending over a set of Commissioners with large salaries to be established at Boston, who were to have the care of collecting those duties; which were by the act expressly mentioned to be intended for the payment of the salaries of Governors, Judges, and other Officers of the Crown in America; it being a pretty general opinion here, that those Officers ought not to depend on the people there for any part of their support.  
It is not my intention to combat this opinion. But perhaps it may be some satisfaction to your Readers to know what ideas the Americans have on the subject. They say then as to Governors, that they are not like Princes whose posterity have an inheritance in the government of a nation, and therefore an interest in its prosperity; they are generally strangers to the Provinces they are sent to govern, have no estate, natural connection, or relation there, to give them an affection for the country; that they come only to make money as fast as they can; are sometimes men of vicious characters and broken fortunes, sent by a Minister merely to get them out of the way; that as they intend staying in the country no longer than their government continues, and purpose to leave no family behind them, they are apt to be regardless of the good will of the people, and care not what is said or thought of them after they are gone. Their situation at the same time gives them many opportunities of being vexatious, and they are often so, notwithstanding their dependance on the Assemblies for all that part of their support that does not arise from fees established by law; but would probably be much more so, if they were to be supported by money drawn from the people without their consent or good will, which is the professed design of this new act. That if by means of these forced duties Government is to be supported in America, without the intervention of the Assemblies, their Assemblies will soon be looked upon as useless, and a Governor will not call them, as having nothing to hope from their meeting, and perhaps something to fear from their enquiries into and remonstrances against this Mal-administration. That thus the people will be deprived of their most essential rights. That it being, as at present, a Governor’s interest to cultivate

e for the penalties of their bonds if he contravenes those instructions. This is what they say as to Governors. As to Judges they alledge, that being appointed from hence, and holding their commissions not during good behaviour, as in Britain, but during pleasure, all the weight of interest or influence would be thrown into one of the scales, (which ought to be held even) if the salaries are also to be paid out of duties raised upon the people without their consent, and independent of their Assemblies approbation or disapprobation of the Judges behaviour. That it is true, Judges should be free from all influence; and therefore, whenever Government here will grant commissions to able and honest Judges during good behaviour, the Assemblies will settle permanent and ample salaries on them during their commissions: But at present they have no other means of getting rid of an ignorant or an unjust Judge (and some of scandalous characters have, they say, been sometimes sent them) but by starving him out.  
I do not suppose these reasonings of theirs will appear here to have much weight. I do not produce them with an expectation of convincing your readers. I relate them merely in pursuance of the task I have impos’d on myself, to be an impartial historian of American facts and opinions.  
The colonists being thus greatly alarmed, as I said before, by the news of the Act for abolishing the Legislature of New-York, and the imposition of these new duties professedly for such disagreeable purposes; (accompanied by a new set of revenue officers with large appointments, which gave strong suspicions that more business of the same kind was soon to be provided for them, that they might earn these salaries;) began seriously to consider their situation, and to revolve afresh in their minds grievances which from their respect and love for this country, they had long borne and seemed almost willing to forget. They reflected how lightly the interest of all America had been estimated here, when the interest of a few inhabitants of Great Britain happened to have the smallest competition with it. That thus the whole American people were forbidden the advantage of a direct importation of wine, oil, and fruit, from Portugal, but must take them loaded with all the expences of a voyage 1000 leagues round about, being to be landed first in England to be re-shipped for America; expences amounting, in war time, at least to 30 per cent. more than otherwise they would have been charged with, and all this merely that a few Portugal merchants in London may gain a commission on those goods passing through their hands. Portugal merchants, by the by, that can complain loudly of the smallest hardships laid on their trade by foreigners, and yet even the last year could oppose with all their influence the giving ease to their fellow subjects labouring under so heavy an oppression! That on a slight complaint of a few Virginia merchants, nine colonies had been restrained from making paper money, become absolutely necessary to their internal commerce from the constant remittance of their gold and silver to Britain. But not only the interest of a particular body of merchants, the interest of any small body of British tradesmen or artificers, has been found, they say, to outweigh that of all the King’s subjects in the colonies. There cannot be a stronger natural right than that of a man’s making the best profit he can of the natural produce of his lands, provided he does not thereby hurt the state in general. Iron is to be found every where in America, and beaver furs are the natural produce of that country: hats and nails, and steel, are wanted there as well as here. It is of no importance to the common welfare of the empire, whether a subject of the King’s gets his living by making hats on this or that side of the water. Yet the Hatters of England have prevailed to obtain an Act in their own favour, restraining that manufacture in America, in order to oblige the Americans to send their beaver to England to be manufactured, and purchase back the hats, loaded with the charges of a double transportation. In the same manner have a few Nailmakers, and still a smaller body of Steelmakers (perhaps there are not half a dozen of these in England) prevailed totally to forbid by an Act of Parliament the erecting of slitting mills or steel furnaces in America,  that the Americans may be obliged to take all the nails for their buildings, and steel for their tools, from these artificers, under the same disadvantages.  
Added to these, the Americans remembered the Act authorizing the most cruel insult that perhaps was ever offered by one people to another, that of emptying our gaols into their settlements; Scotland too having within these two years obtained the privilege it had not before, of sending its rogues and villains also to the plantations. I say, reflecting on these things, they said to one another (their news papers are full of such discourses) these people are not content with making a monopoly of us, forbiding us to trade with any other country of Europe, and compelling us to buy every thing of them, though in many articles we could furnish ourselves 10, 20, and even to 50 per cent. cheaper elsewhere; but now they have as good as declared they have a right to tax us ad libitum internally and externally, and that our constitutions and liberties shall all be taken away, if we do not submit to that claim. They are not content with the high prices at which they sell us their goods, but have now begun to enhance those prices by new duties; and by the expensive apparatus of a new set of officers,  appear to intend an augmentation and multiplication of those burthens that shall still be more grievous to us. Our people have been foolishly fond of their superfluous modes and manufactures, to the impoverishing our country, carrying off all our cash, and loading us with debt; they will not suffer us to restrain the luxury of our inhabitants as they do that of their own, by laws: They can make laws to discourage or prohibit the importation of French superfluities; but though those of England are as ruinous to us as the French ones are to them, if we make a law of that kind, they immediately repeal it. Thus they get all our money from us by trade, and every profit we can any where make by our fisheries, our produce or our commerce, centers finally with them; but this does not signify. It is time then to take care of ourselves by the best means in our power. Let us unite in solemn resolutions and engagements with and to each other, that we will give these new officers as little trouble as possible, by not consuming the British manufactures on which they are to levy the duties. Let us agree to consume no more of their expensive gewgaws. Let us live frugally, and let us industriously manufacture what we can for ourselves: Thus we shall be able honourably to discharge the debts we already owe them, and after that we may be able to keep some money in our country, not only for the uses of our internal commerce, but for the service of our gracious Sovereign, whenever he shall have occasion for it, and think proper to require it of us in the old constitutional manner. For notwithstanding the reproaches thrown out against us in their public papers and pamphlets, notwithstanding we have been reviled in their Senate as Rebels and Traitors, we are truly a loyal people. Scotland has had its rebellions, and England its plots against the present Royal Family; but America is untainted with those crimes; there is in it scarce a man, there is not a single native of our country, who is not firmly attached to his King by principle and by affection. But a new kind of loyalty seems to be required of us, a loyalty to P[arliamen]t; a loyalty, that is to extend, it is said, to a surrender of all our properties, whenever a H[ouse]of C[ommons], in which there is not a single member of our chusing, shall think fit to grant them away without our consent; and to a patient suffering the loss of our privileges as Englishmen, if we cannot submit to make such surrender. We were separated too far from Britain by the Ocean, but we were united to it by respect and love, so that we could at any time freely have spent our lives and little fortunes in its cause: But this unhappy new system of politics tends to dissolve those bands of union, and to sever us for ever.  
These are the wild ravings of the at present half distracted Americans. To be sure, no reasonable man in England can approve of such sentiments, and, as I said before, I do not pretend to support or justify them: But I sincerely wish, for the sake of the manufactures and commerce of Great Britain, and for the sake of the strength which a firm union with our growing colonies would give us, that these people had never been thus

The Waves never rife but when the  
winds blow,  
SIR,  
  
S the eaufe of the prefent ill hu-  
A mour in America, and of the re-  
folutions taken there to purchafe lefs of  
our manufaétures, does not feem to be  
generally underftood, it may afford  
fome fatisfaction to your readers, if you  
give them the following fhort hiftorical  
itate of facts.  
  
From the time that the colonies were  
firft confidered as capable of granting  
aids to the crown, down to the end of  
the laft war, it is faid, that the conftant  
mode of obtaining thofe aids was by re-  
quifition made from the crown through  
its governors to the feveral affemblies,  
in circular letters from the fecretary of  
ftate in his majefty’s name, fetting forth  
the occation, requiring them to take the  
matter into confideration, and expref-  
fing a reliance on their prudence, duty  
and affection to his majefty’s govern-  
ment, that they would grant fuch fums,  
or raifé fuch numbers of men, as were  
fuitable to their refpective circumftances,  
  
The colonies being accuitomed to  
this method, have from time to time  
granted money to the crown, or raifed  
troops for its fervice, in proportion to  
their abilities ; and during all the lait  
  
  
  
The Executioner of K. Charles I. sdentifyed. Ir  
  
war beyond their abilities, fo that confi-  
derable {ums were returned them yearly  
by parliament, as they had exceeded  
their proportion. LS  
  
Had this happy method of Requifition  
been cogtinued, there is no doubt but  
all the money that could reafonably be  
expected to be -rais’d from them in aay  
manner, might have been obtained,  
without the leaft offence.&#x27;

It was well known, that the colonifts  
univerfally were of opinion, that no mo-  
ney could be levied from Englith fub-  
jeéts, but by their own confent given by  
themfelves, or their chofen reprefenta-.  
tives. And that if any man, or body  
of men, in which they had no repre-  
fentative of their chufing, could tax  
them at pleafure, they could not be faid  
to have any property, any thing they  
could call their own.  
  
I do not undertake here to fupport  
thefe opinions of the Americans; they  
have been refuted by a late aét of par-  
liament, declaring its own power ;—  
which very parliament, however, thew&#x27;d  
wilely fo much tender regard to thofe in-  
veterate prejudices, as to repeal a tax  
that had militated againft them. And  
thofe prejudices are ftill fo fixed and  
rooted in the Americans, that, it has  
been fuppofed, not a fingle man among  
them has been convinced of his error,  
even by that act of parliament.  
  
The perfon then who firlt projected  
to lay afide the accuftomed method of  
requifition, and to raife money on Ame-  
rica by ftamps, feems not to have acted  
wifely, in deviating from that method  
(which the colonifts looked upon as  
conftitutional) and thwarting unnecefla-  
rily the fixed prejudices of fo great a  
number of the king’s fubjects.—It was  
  
. not, however, for want of knowledgethat  
  
what he was: about to do would give  
them great offence ; he appears to have  
been very fenfible of this, and apprehen-  
five that it might occafion fome diforders,  
to prevent or fupprefs which, he project-

fame feffion with the ftamp-act, where-  
by it was to be made lawful for military  
officers in the colonies to quarter their  
foldiers in private houfes. ‘This feem&#x27;d  
intended to awe the people into a com-  
pliance with the other act. Great op-

his family at the pleafure of an officer,  
that part of the bill was dropt ;—but  
there ftill remained a claufe, -when it  
paffed into a law, to oblige the feveral  
aifemblies to provide quarters for the  
foldiers, furnifhing them with firing,  
bedding, candles, {mall beer or rum, and  
fundry other articles, at, the expence of  
the feveral provinces. And this act  
continued in force when the ftamp act  
was repealed, though if obligatory on  
the aflemblies, it equally muilitated a-  
gainft the American principle above-  
mentioned, that money is not to be raifed  
on Englifh fubjeéts without their conjent.  
  
The colonies neverthelefs bemg put  
  
into high good humour by the repeal of  
the ttamp-act, chole to avoid a freth dif-  
pute upon the other, it being temporary  
and foon to expire, never, as they hoped,  
to revive again; and in the mean time,  
they, by various ways in different colo-  
nies, provided far the quartering of the  
troops, either by acts of their own al-  
tembiies, without taking notice of the  
A= of P——t, or by some variety or  
{mal} dimimution, as of falt and vine-  
gar, in the fupplies required by the a&amp;,  
that whatthey did, might appear a vo-  
juntary aét of their own, and not doae  
wm) obedience to the A— of P—t, which,  
according to their ideas of their rights,  
they thought hard to obey.  
  
it might have been well if the mattea  
had thus paffed without notice; but a  
G r having written home an angry  
and aggravating letter upon this con-  
dust in the affembly of his province,  
the outed P——r of the ftamp-act and  
his adherents then in the oppofition, raif-  
ed fuch a clamour againit America, as  
being in rebellion, and againit thofe  
who had been tor the repeal of the  
ftainp-aéct, as having thereby been en-  
couragers of this fuppofed rebellion, that  
it was thought necellary to enforce the  
quartering by another act of parliament,  
taking away from the province of New-  
York, which had been the moit explicit  
in its refutal, all the powers of legifla-  
tion, till it fhould have complied with  
that act. The news of which, greatly  
alarmed the people every where in Ame-  
merica, as (it has been taid) the language  
of fuch an a&amp; feemed to them to be,  
Obey implicitly laws made by the parlia-  
ment of Great Britain to raile moncy on  
you-without your conient, or you thail  
enjoy no right or priviledges at all.  
  
At the fame time, a perfon lately in  
hich office, projeéted the levying more  
money from America, by new duties on  
various articles of our own manufacture,  
  
  
  
as glafs, paper, painter’s colours, &amp;c.  
appointing a new board of cuftoms, and  
fending over a fet of commiffioners with  
large falaries to be eftablifhed at Bolton,  
who were to have the care of colle&amp;ing  
thofe duties ; which were by the aét ex-  
prefsly mentioned to be intended for the  
payment of the falarias ‘of governors,  
judges, and other officers of the crown  
in America; it being a pretty general  
opinion here, that thofe cfficers ought  
not to depend on the people there for  
any part of thcir fupport.  
  
Ihe colonifts being thus greatly a-  
larmed, began ferioufly to contider their  
fituation, and to revolve afrefh in their  
minds, grievances, which from their re-  
{pect and love for this country, they had  
long borne, and feemed almoft willing  
to forget. They refle&amp;ted how lightly  
the intereft of all America had been  
eftimated here, when the intereft of a  
few inhabitants of Great-Britain hap-  
pened to have the fmalleft competition  
with it. ‘Chat the whole American  
people were forbidden the advantage ef  
a direct importation of wine, oil, and  
fruit, from Portugal, but mutt take  
them loaded with all the expences of a  
voyage rooo leagues round about, a-  
mounting, in wartime, at leaft to 30 per  
cent. merely that a few Portugal mer-  
chants in London may gain a commiffi-  
on on thote goods paffing through their  
hands. Portugal merchants, by the by,  
that can complain loudly of the fmalleft  
hardthips laid on their trade by foreign-  
ers, and yet even the laft year could op-  
pole with all their influence the giving  
eale to their fellew fubjecs labouring  
under fo heavy an oppreffion !—That  
on a flight complaint of a few Virginia  
merchants, nine colonies had been re-  
{trained from making paper money, be-  
come abfolutely neceffary to their inter-  
nal commerce from. the conftant remit-  
tance of their gold and filver to Britain.  
  
--That the hatters of England have  
prevailed to obtain an aét in their own

America, in order to oblige the Ameri-  
cans to fend their beaver to England to  
be manufactured, and purchafe back the  
hats, loaded with the charges of a dou-  
ble tran{portation.—In the fame man-  
ner have a few nailmakers, and ftill2  
imaller body of fteelmakers (perhaps  
there are not half a dozen of thefe in  
England) prevailed totally to forbid by  
an act of parliament the ereéting of flit-  
ting milis or fteel furnaces in America,

and fteel for their tools, from thefe ar-

Add to thefe, the Americans re-  
membered the aét authorizing the moft  
cruel infult that perhaps was ever offered  
by one&#x27;people to another, that of empty-  
ing our goals into their fettlements ;  
Scotland ‘too having within thefe two  
years obtained the privilege it had . not  
before, of fending its rogues and vil-  
lains alfo to the plantations. I fay, re-  
fleing on thefe things, they faid to  
one another (their news-papers are full  
ef fuch difcourfes) thefe people are not  
content with making a monopoly of us,  
forbidding us to trade with any other  
country of Europe, and compelling us  
to buy every thing of them, though in  
many articles we could furniflr our-  
felvyes 10, 20, and even to 50 per cent.  
cheaper elfewhere; but now they have  
as good as declared they have a right to  
tax us ad libitum internally and exter-  
nally, and that our conftitutions and li-  
berties fall all be taken away, if We do  
not fubmit to thatclaim. They are not  
content with the high prices at which  
they fell us their goods, but have now  
begun to enhance thofe prices by new  
duties; and by the extenfive apparatus  
of a new fet of officers, appear to intend  
an augmentation and multiplication of  
thofe burthens that fhall ftill be more  
grievous to us, Our people have been  
foolithly fond of their fuperfluous modes  
and manufactures, to the impoverifhing  
our country, carrying off all our cafh,  
and Joading us with debt; they will not  
fuffer us to reftrain the luxury of our  
inhabitants as they do that of their own,  
by laws: They can make laws to dif-  
courage or prohibit the importation of  
French fuperfluities ; but though thofe  
of England are as ruinous to us as the  
French ones are to them, if we make a  
kaw of that kind, they immediately re-  
eal it. Thus they get all our money  
wk us by trade, and every’ profit we  
can any where make by our fifheries,  
our produce, or our commerce, centers  
finally with them; but this does not  
fatisfy. It is time then to take care ‘of  
eurfelves by the beft means in our pow-  
er. Let us unite in {olemn refolutions  
aad engagements with and to each other,  
that we will give thefe new officers as  
little trouble as poffible, by.not confum-  
ing the Britith manufactures ont which  
they are to levy the duties. Let us-a-  
gree to confume no more of their ex-  
penfive gewgaws. Let us live frugally,  
and let us induftriouly manufaGure  
what we can for otirfélves : “Thus we

the debts we already owe them, and af.  
ter that we may be able to keep fome  
money in our country, not only for the  
ufes of our internal commerce, but for  
the fervice of our gracious fovereign,  
whenever he fhall have occafion. for it,  
and think proper to require it of us in the  
old confiitutional manner. Fornotwith-  
ftanding the reproaches thrown out a-  
gainft us in their public. papers and  
pamphlets, notwithitanding we have  
been reviled in their fenate.as Rebels and  
Traitors, we are truly a loyal people.  
Scotland has had its rebellions, and En-  
oe its plots againft the prefent royal  
  
amily ; but America is untainted with  
thofe crimes ; -there is in it {carce a man,  
there is not a fingle native of our coun-  
try, who is not firmly attached to his  
king by principle and by affection. But  
anew kind of loyalty feems to be re-  
quired of us, a loyalty to P. tj.8  
loyalty, that is toextend, it is faid, to a  
furrender of all our properties, when-  
ever a H— of C—, in which there is not  
a fingle member of our chufing, fhall  
think fit to grant them away without  
our confent ; and to a patient fuffering  
the lofs of our privileges as Englifh-  
men, if we cannot-fubmit te make fuch  
furrender.. We were feparated too far  
from Britain by the ocean, but we were  
united to it by refpe&amp;t-and love, fo that  
we could at any time freely have {pent  
our lives and little fortunes in its caufe :  
But this unhappy new fyftem of politics  
tends to diffolve thofe bands of union,  
and to fever us forever...  
  
Thefe are the wild ravings of the at  
prefent half diftra&amp;ed Americans. To  
be fure, no reafonable man in England  
can approve of fuch fentiments, and, as  
I faid before, Ido not pretend to fupport  
or ju@ify them: But I fincerely with,  
for the fake- of the manufactures and  
commerce of Great ‘Britain, and for the  
fake of the ftrength which a firm union  
with our growing colonies would give  
us, that thefe people had-never béen thus

FROM the time the colonies were  
  
firit confidered as capable of grant-  
ing aids to the crown, down to theend  
of the laft war, the conftant mode of  
obtaining thofe aids was by requifi-  
tion, fetting forth the occafion,andex-  
preffing a reliace-on their prudence,  
duty, and affection, to grant fuch  
fums, or raife fuch numbers of men,  
as were fuitable to their refpective  
circumftances.  
  
The colonics being accuftomed to  
this method, have from time to time  
granted money to the crown, or rail-  
ed troops for its fervice, in propor-  
tion to their abilities, and, during  
the lait war, beyond their abilities;  
fo that-confiderable fums were re-  
turned them yearly by Parliament  
as exceeding the proportion,  
  
There is no doubt but all rhe mo-  
ney that could reafonabiy have been  
expected from them might have been  
obtained without the leait murmur-  
ing or difeontent.  
  
Tt has been thought wifdom in  
Governors to pay fome regard to  
the prevailing and ettablithed opi-  
nions among the people to he govern-  
ed, wherever fuch opinions might in  
their effects promote or obtirudt pub-  
lic meafures. This had been the wif-  
dom of our government with refpedt  
  
413  
to raifing money in the colonies. It  
was well known, that the colonilfts  
univerfally were of opinion, that no  
money could be levied from Englith  
fubjects, but by their own confent ;  
that therefore whatever money was  
to be raifed from the people in the  
colonies, mutt firt be granted by their  
affemblies ; that-this right of grant-  
ing their own money was effential ta  
Englith liberty ; and that, if any man,  
or body of men, in which they had  
no reprefentative of their chufing,  
could tax them at pleafure, they  
could not be faid to have any pro-  
perty, any thing they could call their  
own,  
  
I do not undertake here to fupport  
thofe opinions; they have been refut-  
ed by alate aét of Parliament, declar-  
ing its own power; which very Pare  
liament, however, thewed wifely fo  
much tender regard to thofe invete-  
rate prejudices, as to repeal a tax that  
had odioufly militated again them;  
and thofe prejudices are ftill fo fixed  
and rooted in the Americans, that it  
is fuppofed not a fingle man among  
them has been convinced of his er-

exprefsly mentioned to be intended

thofe officers ought ‘not to depend

It is not my intestion to combat

fome fatisfaétion to thé public to know  
what ideas the Americans have on the

they can, are frequently men of vi-  
cious charaéters and broken fortunes,  
fent merely to get them off the hands  
of a Minitter fomewhere out of the

the country no longer than their gor  
vernment continues, and purpofe to  
Jeave no family behind them, théy  
are apt to be regardlefs of the goods  
will of the people, and care not what  
Ts faid or thought of them after théy  
are gone, Their fituation gives them  
many Opportunities of bemng vexae

ftanding their dependence on the al*  
femblies for al} that part of their fup«  
port that does not arife from fees efta-

be much more fo, ‘if they were to be  
fully {upported by money drawn from  
the people without the confent or

profeffed defign of this aé.  
  
This is what they fay as to Gover-

As to Judges, they allege, that,  
being appointed from hence by the

the weight of intereft would be thrown

againft thofe who had been forthe repeal  
of the ftamp act, as having thereby been  
encouragers of thts fuppoted rebellion,  
that it was thought necellary toentorce  
the quartering act by another act of par-  
hament, tak‘ away from the province  
ot “Till which had been moi  
explicit in its refufal, all  
legiflation, till it complied with that act ;  
the news of which greatly alarmed the  
people every where. in America, as the  
language of fuch an act feemed to be—  
Obey im plicitly laws made by the par-  
liament of Great Britain, to force money  
from you without your confent, or you  
fhall enjoy no rights or pti oe at all,  
  
At the fame time the late Chancellor  
of the I°xchequer, defirous of ingra-  
  
tating himielf with the oppofition, or  
driven to it by their clamours, projected  
the levying more money from America,  
by new duties on various articles of our  
own manutacture, as glafs, paper, pain-  
ters colours, &amp;c. appointing a new board  
of cufioms, and fending over a fet of  
commiffioners (with large falaries) to be  
eftablifhed at Bofion, who were to have  
the care of collecting thefe duties; and  
which were, by the act, exprefsly men  
tioned to be intended for the payment  
of the falaries of governors, judges, and  
other othcers of the crown in America,  
it being a pretty general opinion here,  
that thofe othcers ought not to depen d  
onthe people there for any part of their  
lupport.  
  
[t is not my intention to combat this  
opinion: but perhaps it may be {ome  
fatisfaction to the public to know what  
ideas the Americans have on the fubject.  
They fay then, as to Governors, that  
they are not like Princes whofe poiterity  
have an inheritance in the government  
of a nation, and theretore an intereit in  
its profperity ; they are generally itran-  
gers to the provinces they are fent to  
natural  
  
govern ; have no eitate, con-  
nection, or relation there, to give them  
an afection for the country ; that they  
come only to make money as falt as they  
  
can, are frequently men of vicious cha-  
  
racters and broken fortunes, fent merely  
to get them off the hands of a Miunifler  
tomewhere out of the way; that, as they  
intend fiaying in the country no longer  
than their government continues, and  
purpofe to leave no family behind them,  
they are apt to be regardlefs of the good -  
will of the pe opie, and care not what  
7s faid or thought of them after they are  
gone, Their fituation gives them many  
  
the po WCOTS of  
  
  
  
Rife of the prefent Ill-humour in America, Oa  
  
opportunities of being VeXatious.  
  
they are often fo, notwithftanding th  
de ‘pendance on the allemb 1€$ for a] n  
part of their fupport that does no,  
trom fees eftablithed by law - but wo  
probably be much more fo, if t they were  
to be fully lupported by money draws  
  
from the peop! e without the Cont ram  
ro md-will of the people, w  
profetied defign of this act.  
  
This 1s what they fay as to Governors  
| As to Judges, they alleve, that, be.  
Ing appointed from hence by the crown,  
and holding their commi{h ons, not dur.  
in good behaviour, as in Britain, by:  
during pleature, all the weight of jp.  
tere{t would be thrown into one of the  
{cales (which ought to be held even),  
if the falaries are alfo to be paid out gy  
duties forced from the people withoy  
their confent, and independent of the’  
aflemblies approbation or difapprobatiog  
of the judges behaviour ; that wheneve  
the crown will grant peat dr“ to able  
and honett judyes, during good behav.  
or, the aileudbties wil! fettle permanent  
and ample falaries on them during the  
commiffions ; but at pretent they ba  
no other means of getting rid of an j

and tee! furnaces in America, that the  
Americans may be obliged to take nails

powers, and that the purpose of the Assemblies was to stand  
for what they deemed their constitutional rights. The im-  
portant fact to be noticed is that the prerogative and power of  
the King and their gubernatorial assertion were a continual  
source of restiveness and irritation to the colonies. The char-  
acter of their governors, as a rule, made them unacceptable  
to the Americans. The colonists looked upon the governors,  
as Franklin represented, not like rulers whose posterity have  
an inheritance in the government of a nation, and therefore an  
interest in its prosperity ; they were generally strangers to the  
  
provinces they were sent to govern; had no estate, natural

the country ; they came only to make money as fast as they  
could ; they were sometimes even of vicious characters and  
broken fortunes, sent by a minister merely to get them out of  
the way; as they intended staying in the country no longer  
than their government continued, and purposed to leave no  
family behind them, they were apt to be regardless of the good  
will of the people, and they cared not what was said or thought  
of them after they were gone.&quot; This is what the Americans  
said of their governors. They were governors neither of the  
people nor for the people whom they were sent to govern ;  
and when the first crisis of the Revolution came, it is not sur-  
prising that the conviction was found firmly imbedded in the  
minds of the Americans, that if duties were to be forced upon  
them to support these governors and their governments, with-  
out the intervention of their Assemblies, the Assemblies would  
soon be looked upon as useless. Therefore, in resisting the  
unconstitutional interference of the King and his governors,  
or in their invasions on the prerogative, if one chooses so to  
eall it; in their effort to keep their governors and judges de-  
pendent on popular favor and support and thus keep the real  
power in administration in the hands of the people—in this  
contention the colonists felt that they were standing for their  
dearest and most essential rights. The right to a representa

Thus “ the interest of a small body of British tradesmen or  
artificers,” says Franklin, “ has been found to outweigh that  
of all the King’s subjects in the colonies.” There cannot be a  
stronger natural right than that of a man’s making the best  
profit he can of the natural produce of his hands, provided he  
does not thereby hurt the state in general. Iron is to be  
found everywhere in America, and the beaver furs are the  
natural produce of that country. Hats and nails and steel are  
wanted there as well as here. It is of no importance to the  
common welfare of the Empire, whether a subject of the King  
obtains his living by making hats on this or on that side of  
the water. Yet the hatters of England have prevailed to  
obtain an act in their own favor, restraining that manufacture  
in America in order to oblige the Americans to send their  
beaver to England to be manufactured, and to purchase back  
the hats loaded with the charges of a double transportation.  
In the same manner have a few nail makers, and a still smaller  
body of steel makers prevailed totally to forbid by an act of  
Parliament, the erection of slitting mills or steel furnaces in  
America, that the Americans may be obliged to take all their  
nails for their buildings and steel for their tools from these  
artificers under the same disadvantages.&#x27;  
  
In view of these things it does not seem unreasonable to say  
that to release labor and trade from their restrictions was the  
object of the Revolution. So important has this appeared to  
writers on this chapter of our history that it has been said  
that “but for the policy which oppressed the commerce and  
inhibited the use of the waterfalls of New England, the dis

Franklin reminded the ministry of this important truth in  
discussing for the English ruling classes the causes of Ameri-  
can discontent. “It was well known,” says Franklin, “ that  
the colonists universally were of opinion that no money could  
be levied from English subjects but by their own consent,  
j given by themselves or their chosen representatives; that,  
therefore, whatever money was to be raised from the people  
of the colonies, must first be granted by their assemblies, as  
the money raised in Britain is first to be granted by the  
House of Commons; that this right of granting their own
