How to make a Striking Sundial, by which not only a Man’s own Family, but all his Neighbours for ten Miles round, may know what o’Clock it is, when the Sun shines, without seeing the Dial.  
Chuse an open Place in your Yard or Garden, on which the Sun may shine all Day without any Impediment from Trees or Buildings. On the Ground mark out your Hour Lines, as for a horizontal Dial, according to Art, taking Room enough for the Guns. On the Line for One o’Clock, place one Gun; on the Two o’Clock Line two Guns, and so of the rest. The Guns must all be charged with Powder, but Ball is unnecessary. Your Gnomon or Style must have twelve burning Glasses annex’d to it, and be so placed as that the Sun shining through the Glasses, one after the other, shall cause the Focus or burning Spot to fall on the Hour Line of One for Example, at one a Clock, and there kindle a Train of Gunpowder that shall fire one Gun. At Two a Clock, a Focus shall fall on the Hour Line of Two, and kindle another Train that shall discharge two Guns successively; and so of the rest.  
Note, There must be 78 Guns in all. Thirty-two Pounders will be best for this Use; but 18 Pounders may do, and will cost less, as well as use less Powder, for nine Pounds of Powder will do for one Charge of each eighteen Pounder, whereas the Thirty-two Pounders would require for each Gun 16 Pounds.  
Note also, That the chief Expence will be the Powder, for the Cannon once bought, will, with Care, last 100 Years.  
Note moreover, That there will be a great Saving of Powder in cloudy Days.  
Kind Reader, Methinks I hear thee say, That it is indeed a good Thing to know how the Time passes, but this Kind of Dial, notwithstanding the mentioned Savings, would be very expensive; and the Cost greater than the Advantage. Thou art wise, my Friend, to be so considerate beforehand; some Fools would not have found out so much, till they had made the Dial and try’d it. Let all such learn that many a private and many a publick Project, are like this Striking Dial, great Cost for little Profit.

Conversation Hints.  
  
Good Sense and Learning may Esteem obtain,  
Humour and Wit a Laugh, if rightly ta’en;  
Fair Virtue Admiration may impart;  
But ’tis Good-Nature only wins the Heart:  
It molds the Body to an easy Grace,  
And brightens every Feature of the Face;  
It smooths th’unpolish’d Tongue with Eloquence,  
And adds Persuasion to the finest Sense.

usements are in the End more tiresome than Labour itself.  
  
Uneasy both in Country and in Town,  
They search a Place to lay their Burthen down:  
One, restless in his Parlour, walks abroad,  
And vainly thinks to leave behind his Load;  
But strait returns; for he’s as restless there,  
And finds there’s no Relief in open Air.  
To’s Country Seat another would retire,  
And spurs as hard as if it were on Fire,  
There soon begins to yawn, and stretch and snore,  
And seeks the City which he left before.  
  
February. II Month.  
  
Would you both please, and be instructed too,  
The Pride of shewing forth yourself subdue.  
Hear ev’ry Man upon his fav’rite Theme,  
And ever be more knowing than you seem.  
The lowest Genius will afford some Light,  
Or give a Hint that had escap’d your Sight.  
Doubt, till he thinks you on Conviction yield,  
And with fit Questions let each Pause be fill’d.  
  
And the most knowing will with Pleasure grant,  
You’re rather much reserv’d than ignorant.  
  
’Tis easier to build two Chimneys, than maintain one in Fuel.  
Anger warms the Invention, but overheats the Oven.  
Is there any Duty in Religion more generally agreed on, or more justly required by God, than a perfect Submission to his Will in all Things? Can any Disposition of Mind, either please him more, or become us better, than that of being satisfied with all he gives, and content with all he takes away? None, certainly, can be of more Honour to God, nor of more Ease to ourselves; for if we consider him as our Maker, we dare not contend with him; if as our Father, we ought not to mistrust him; so that we may be confident whatever he does is for our Good, and whatever happens that we interpret otherwise, yet we can get nothing by Repining, nor save anything by Resisting.  
  
’Tis done, O Lord, the Idol I resign,  
Unfit to share a Heart so justly thine;  
Nor can the Heav’nly Call unwelcome be,  
That still invites my Soul more near to thee:  
Ye Shades, ye Phantoms, and ye Dreams adieu!  
With Smiles I now your parting Glories view.  
I see the Hand; I worship, I adore,  
And justify the great disposing Power.  
  
Rules of Law fit to be observed in purchasing.From an old Book.  
  
First, see the Land which thou intend’st to buy,  
Within the Seller’s Title clear doth lie.  
And that no Woman to it doth lay Claim,  
By Dowry, Jointure, or some other Name,  
That it may cumber. Know if bound or free  
The Tenure stand, and that from each Feoffee  
  
It be releas’d: That the Seller be so old  
That he may lawful sell, thou lawful hold.  
Have special Care that it not mortgag’d lie,  
Nor be entailed on Posterity.  
Then if it stand in Statute bound or no:  
Be well advis’d what Quit Rent out must go;  
What Custom, Service hath been done of old,  
By those who formerly the same did hold.  
And if a wedded Woman put to Sale,  
Deal not with her, unless she bring her Male.  
For she doth under Covert-Baron go,  
Altho’ sometimes some also traffick so.  
Thy Bargain being made, and all this done,  
Have special Care to make thy Charter run  
To thee, thine Heirs, Executors, Assigns,  
For that beyond thy Life securely binds.  
These Things foreknown and done, you may prevent  
Those Things rash Buyers many times repent.  
And yet, when as you have done all you can,  
If you’d be sure, deal with an honest Man.  
  
Very good Rules, these, and sweetly sung. If they are learnt by heart, and repeated often to keep them in Memory, they may happen t

The Rays of Wit gild wheresoe’er they strike,

And raise a Foe as often as a Friend;

Sincerity has such resistless Charms,  
She oft the fiercest of our Foes disarms:  
No Art she knows, in native Whiteness dress’d,  
Her Thoughts all pure, and therefore all express’d:

And without her all other Virtues die.

om one we love. But the strictest Intimacy can never warrant Freedoms of this Sort; and it is indeed preposterous to think they should; unless we can suppose Injuries are less Evils when they are done us by Friends, than when they come from other Hands.  
  
Excess of Wit may oftentimes beguile:  
Jests are not always pardon’d—by a Smile.  
Men may disguise their Malice at the Heart,  
And seem at Ease—tho’ pain’d with inward Smart.  
Mistaken, we—think all such Wounds of course  
Reflection cures;—alas! it makes them worse.  
Like Scratches they with double Anguish seize,  
Rankle in time, and fester by Degrees.

A Story should, to please, at least seem true,  
Be apropos, well told, concise, and new;  
And whensoe’er it deviates from these Rules,  
The Wise will sleep, and leave Applause to Fools.  
But others, more intolerable yet,  
The Waggeries that they’ve said, or heard, repeat;  
Heavy by Mem’ry made, and what’s the worst,  
At second-hand as often as at first.

easily borne than those that touch his Religion. Men are generally warm in what regards their religious Tenets, either from Tenderness of Conscience, or a high Sense of their own Judgments. People of plain Parts and honest Dispositions, look on Salvation as too serious a Thing to be jested with; and Men of speculative Religion, who profess from the Conviction rather of their Heads than Hearts, are not a bit less vehement than the real Devotees. He who says a slight or a severe Thing of their Faith, seems to them to have thereby undervalued their Understandings, and will consequently incur their Aversion, which no Man of common Sense would hazard for a lively Expression; much less a Person of good Breeding, who should make it his chief Aim to be well with all.  
  
Like some grave Matron of a noble Line,  
With awful Beauty does Religion shine.  
Just Sense should teach us to revere the Dame,  
Nor, by imprudent Jests, to spot her Fame.  
In common Life you’ll own this Reas’ning right,  
That none but Fools in gross Abuse delight:  
Then use it here—nor think the Caution vain;  
To be polite, Men need not be profane.

For all must grant it needs no common Art  
To keep Men patient while we make them smart.  
Not Wit alone, nor Humour’s self, will do,  
Without Good nature, and much Prudence too.

Men of speculative religion, who are so from  
the conviction rather of their heads than their  
hearts. are not a grain less vehement than the real  
devotees. He who says a slight or a severe thing  
of their faith, seems, to them, to have thereby un-  
dervalued their understandings, and will conse-  
quently incur their aversion, which no man of  
common sense would hazard for a lively expres-  
sion: much less a person of good breeding, who  
should make it his chief aim to be well with all.

Just sense should teach us to revere the dame!  
  
Nor, by imprudent jests, to spot her fame.  
  
In common life you’ll own this reasoning right,  
  
That none but fools in gross abuse delight ;  
  
Then use it here—nor think our caution vain—  
  
To be polite men need not be profane.

the historian uncovers with reverence the venerable reliques  
of antiquity ; and as the philosopher seeks in the soul the  
mark of God’s signet which He stamped there at the crea-  
tion, so in the life of past ages the historian points out to  
us the signs of His presence, and teaches us to watch the  
course of Providence. Far removed is this from the pov-  
erty-stricken Epicureanism, which sees nothing divine in  
the soul, and says, in the semblance of religious humility,  
  
‘He sees with equal eye, as God of all,  
  
A hero perish or a sparrow fall ;  
  
Atoms or systems into ruin hurled,  
  
And now a bubble burst, and now a world.”

 is being met with in adjusting

from the change from an active to a quiet  
market.” The success of a scheme to secure  
money on forged mortgages on property  
owned by non-residents has occasioned some  
ey, among investorsand agents. All these  
irregularities and difficulties go to prove that  
  
much of the advice in the subjoined list of.  
  
rhyme is as good today as when it was written.  
It is from the South Carolina and Georgia  
Almanae of the year 1865. It is printed in old  
English under the caption “To Prevent Law-  
Suits in Land Affairs,” and is as follows:  
First see the land which thou intendst to buy  
Within the seller&#x27;s title clear doth lie;  
  
And that no woman to it doth lay claim,  
  
By dowery, jointure, or some other name,  
  
That may it cumber. ow if bound or free  
  
The tenure stands, and that from each feoffee  
  
It be . That the seller be so old  
  
Then 1f it stand in statute  
  
Then ised what quit-rent on it must go;  
What custom service hath been done of old  
  
By those who formerly the same did hold.  
  
And if a wedded woman put to sale  
  
Deal not with her unless she brings her male;  
For she doth under covert baron go  
  
Altho’ sometimes some also traffic se.  
  
The bargain beiig made, and ali this done,  
Have special care to have thy charter run  
  
To thee, thine heirs, executors, assigns,  
  
For that beyond they life securely binds.  
These things foreknown and done, you may avoid  
Those things which buyers often do repent ;  
And yet when you have done all that you can,  
If you&#x27;d be sure deal with an honest man.

m? The opiate is for  
you, madam. --Hamburger Nach­  
richton.  
When Richard I, with the other  
crusaders, took Mossina, all the no­  
blo and good looking women of the  
town were carried off. Some wore  
afterward ransomed, while the great­  
or part were hold as slaves by their  
captors.  
Bamboo pens have booeen used in  
India for over 1,000 years. They  
are mado like the ordinary quill  
pen, and for a few hours&#x27; writing  
are said to be very serviceable.  
The number of trees growing in  
the public highways of the city of  
London is founid to be 14,700. Those  
are on the public highways alone  
and not in the parks.  
Above all things, raillery decline;  
it is in ablest hands a dangerous  
tool, but never fails to wound the  
meddling fool.-Stillingfleet
