Philadelphia, 3 June, 1789.  
  
I have made a rule to myself that your Excellency should not be troubled with any solicitations from me for favors to any even of my nearest connections, but here is a matter of justice in which the honor of our country is concerned, and therefore I cannot refuse giving this line for your information. Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, father of the young gentleman who will have the honor of waiting on you with this, was the first in France who gave us credit, and before the Court showed us any countenance trusted us with 2000 barrels of gunpowder, and from time to time afterwards exerted himself to furnish the Congress with supplies of various kinds, which, for want of due returns, they being of great amount, has finally much distressed him in circumstances. Young Mr. Chaumont has now been here near four years, soliciting a settlement of the accounts merely, and though the payment of the balance, to be sure, would be acceptable, yet proposing to refer that to the time when it shall better suit the convenience of our Government.  
This settlement, if the father had it to show, would tend to quiet his creditors, and might be made use of for that purpose; but his son has not hitherto been able to obtain it, and is detained in this country at an expense that answered no end. He  
  
hopes, however, now, that your Excellency may prevail to have some settlement made of those accounts, that he may carry home to his father the statement of them; and I the rather hope this likewise, that we may thereby be freed from the imputation of adding ingratitude to injustice.

I have made a rule to myself that your Excellency  
should not be troubled with any solicitations from me  
for favors to any even of my nearest connections, but  
here is a matter of justice in which the honor of our  
country is concerned, and therefore I cannot refuse  
giving this line for your information. Mr. Le Ray de  
Chaumont, father of the young gentleman who will  
have the honor of waiting on you with this, was the  
first in France who gave us credit, and. before the Court  
showed us any countenance trusted us with 2000 bar-  
rels of gunpowder, and from time to time afterwards  
exerted himself to furnish the Congress with supplies  
of various kinds, which, for want of due returns, they  
being of great amount, has finally much distressed him  
in circumstances. Young Mr. Chaumont has now been  
here near four years, soliciting a settlement of the ac-  
counts merely, and though the payment of the balance,  
to be sure, would be acceptable, yet proposing to refer  
that to the time when it shall better suit the conven-  
ience of our Government.  
  
This settlement, if the father had it to show, would
