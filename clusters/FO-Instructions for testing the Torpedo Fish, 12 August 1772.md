It has long been supposed that the Stroke given by the Torpedo was the Effect of sudden violent muscular Motion. It is now suspected to be an Effect of the electric or some similar subtil Fluid, which that Fish has a Power of acting upon and agitating at Pleasure.  
To discover whether it be the Effect of a subtil Fluid, or of muscular Motion, let the Fish be touch’d with the usual Conductors of Electricity, viz. Iron or other Metals; and with the known Non-conductors of Electricity, dry Wood, Glass, Wax, &amp;c. If the Stroke be communicated thro’ the first and not thro’ the latter, there is so far a Similarity with the electric Fluid; and at the same time a Proof that the Stroke is not an Effect of mere muscular Motion.  
Let it be observed whether the Stroke is sometimes given on the near Approach of a conducting Body without actual Contact; if so, that is another similar Circumstance. Then observe whether in that Case any Snap is heard; and in the Dark whether any Light or Spark is seen between the Fish and the approaching Body. If not, there the Fluids differ.  
Let a Number of Persons standing on the Ground, join Hands, and let one touch the Fish so as to receive the Stroke. If all feel it, then let him be laid with his Belly on a Plate of Metal; let one of the Persons so joining Hands touch that Plate, while the farthest from the Plate with a Rod of Metal touches the Back of the Fish; and then observe whether the Force of the Stroke seems to be the same to all in the Circuit as it was before, or stronger.  
Repeat the last Experiment with this Variation. Let two of the Persons in the Circuit hold each an uncharg’d electric Phial, the Knobs at the Ends of their Wires touching. After the Stroke, let it be observ’d whether those Wires will attract and repel light Bodies; and whether a Cork Ball suspended by a long silk String so as to hang between the Wires at a small Distance from the Knob of each, will be attracted and repell’d alternately to and from each Knob; if so, the Back and Belly of the Fish are at the Time of the Stroke in different States of Electricity.

It has long been supposed that the Stroke given by  
the Torpedo was the Effect of sudden violent muscular  
Motion. It is now suspected to be an Effect of the Elec-  
tric or some similar subtil Fluid which that Fish has  
the Power of acting upon and agitating at Pleasure.  
  
To discover whether it be the Effect of a subtil Fluid,  
or of Muscular Motion, let the Fish be touch’d with  
the usual Conductors of Electricity, viz. :—Iron, or  
other Metals; and with the known Non-Conductors,  
dry Wood, Glass, Wax, ete. If the Stroke be com-  
muuicated thro’ the First and not the Latter, there is  
so far a Similarity with the electric Fluids, and at the  
same Time a Proof that the Stroke is not an Effect of  
mere muscular Motion.  
  
Let it be observed whether the Stroke is sometimes  
given on the near Approach of a conducting Body  
without actual Contact ; if so, that is another similar  
Cirecumstance.—Then observe whether in that case any  
Snap is heard; and in the Dark any Light or Spark is  
seen between the Fish and the approaching Body. If  
not, there the Fluids differ.  
  
Let a Number of Persons stand on the Ground, join  
Hands, and let One touch the Fish, so as to receive  
the Stroke. If ail feel it, then let him be laid with  
his Belly on the Plate of the Metal; let one of the  
Persons so joining Hands touch that Plate, while the  
farthest from the Plate with a Rod of Metal touch the  
Back of the Fish; and then observe whether the Force  
of the Stroke seems to be the same to all in Circuit as  
it was before, or stronger.  
  
Repeat the last Experiment with this Variation.  
Let two of the Persons in the Circuit hold each an un-  
charged electric Phial, the Knobs at the Ends of their  
Wires touching. After the Stroke, let it be observed  
whether those Wires will attract or repel like Bodies,  
and whether a cork Ball suspended by a long silk  
String, so as to hang between the Wires at a small  
Distance from the Knobs of each will be attracted and  
repelled, alternating to and from each Knob; if so,  
the Back and Belly of the Fish are at the Time of  
the Stroke in different States of Electricity.

&quot;Jt has long be supposed that the  
stroke given by the torpedo was the  
effect of sudden violent muscular mo­  
tion. It is now suspected to be an ef­  
fect of the electric or some similar sub­  
tle fluid when that fish lias the power  
of acting upon and agitating at pleas­  
ure. To discover whether it be the  
effect of a subtil fluid, or of muscu­  
lar motion, let the fish be touched  
with the usual conductors of electri­  
citj&quot;, viz: Iron, or other metals and  
with the known non-conductors, dry  
wood, glass, wax, etc. If the stroke

not an effect of mere muscular mo­

Instructions are given to &quot;let a num­  
ber of persons stand on the ground,  
join hands, and one touch the fish, so  
as to receive the stroke. If all feel it,  
then let him be laid with his belly on  
the plate of the metal let one of the  
persons so joining hands touch that  
plate, while the farthest from the  
plate with a rod of metal touch the  
back of the fish and then, observe  
whether the force of the stroke seems  
to be the same to all in the circuit as  
it was before, or stronger.&quot; The let­  
ter concludes with further tests for  
determining whether the back and  
belly of the fish are at the time of the  
stroke in different states of electricity
