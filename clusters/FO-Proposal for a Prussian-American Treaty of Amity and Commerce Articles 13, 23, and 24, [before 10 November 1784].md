discussions of how to broaden Article 23. The United States would be amending international law with this set of treaties: why not take full advantage of the opportunity and extend the protections to include a class of men who, in the recent war, had been deprived of food and exposed to inhumane living conditions?  
The gross mistreatment of prisoners had been an urgent, longstanding concern of all three commissioners. As governor of Virginia, Jefferson faced the question of how to deal with British prisoners of war given the notorious British abuse of American captives. In 1779 he noted to Patrick Henry: “It is for the benefit of mankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much as possible. The practice therefore of modern nations of treating captive enemies with politeness and generosity is not only delightful in contemplation but really interesting to all the world, friends foes and neutrals.” Franklin, as has been we

une, 1786, Jefferson sent Jean-Nicolas Démeunier, who was writing the entry on the United States for the Encyclopédie Méthodique, copies of Articles 13, 23, and 24 of the Prussian-American treaty, describing at length the British abuses of American prisoners that were reflected in Article 24. The following September, in a letter to Ezra Stiles, Jefferson mentioned the death of Frederick II and noted: “The articles of this [treaty] which were intended to prevent or mitigate wars, by lessening their ailment, are so much applauded in Europe that I think the example will be followed.”  
  
[before November 10, 1784]  
  
13. And in the same case of one of the contracting parties being engaged in war with any other power, to prevent all the difficulties &amp; misunderstandings that usually arise respecting the merchandize heretofore called contraband, such as Arms, Ammunition, &amp; military Stores of every kind, no such articles carried in the vessels or by the subjects or citizens of one of the parties to the enemies of the other shall be deemed contraband so as to induce confiscation or condemnation &amp; a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless it shall be lawful to stop such vessels &amp; articles &amp; to detain them for such length of time as the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding, paying however a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors: and it shall further be allowed to use in the service of the captors the whole or any part of the military stores so detained, paying the owners the full value of the same to be ascertained by the current price at the place of its destination.  
  
23. If war should arise between the two contracting parties, the merchants of either country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine Months to collect their debts &amp; settle their affairs, &amp; may depart freely, carrying of all their effects, without molestation or hindrance. And all women &amp; children, scholars of every faculty, cultivators of the earth, artizans manufacturers &amp; fishermen unarmed, &amp; inhabiting unfortified towns, villages or places, whose occupations are for the common subsistence &amp; benefit of mankind, shall be allowed to continue their respective employments, and shall not be molested in their persons nor shall their houses or goods be burnt or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields wasted by the armed force of the enemy into whose power, by the events of war, they may happen to fall: but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price. And all merchant &amp; trading vessels employed in exchanging the products of different places, &amp; thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniences &amp; comforts of human life more easy to be obtained &amp; more general, shall be allowed to pass free &amp; unmolested. And neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue any commission to any private armed vessels empowering them to take or destroy such trading vessels or interrupt such commerce.  
24. And to prevent the destruction of prisoners of war by sending them into distant &amp; inclement countries, or by crouding them into close &amp; noxious places, the two contracting parties solemnly pledge themselves to each other &amp; to the world that they will not adopt any such practice; that neither will send the prisoners whom they may take from the other into the East-Indies or any other parts of Asia or Africa; but that they shall be placed in some part of their dominions in Europe or America, in wholesome situations, that they shall not be confined in dungeons, prisonships, or prisons, nor be put into irons, nor bound, nor otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs,  
  
that the officers shall be enlarged on their paroles within convenient districts &amp; have comfortable quarters, &amp; the common men be disposed in cantonments open &amp; extensive enough for air &amp; exercise, &amp; lodged in barracks as roomly &amp; good as are provided by the party in whose power they are for their own troops, that the officers shall also be daily furnished by the party in whose power they are with as many rations &amp; of the same articles &amp; quality as are allowed by them, either in kind or by commutation, to officers of equal rank in their own Army, and all others shall be daily furnished by them with such ration as they allow to a common soldier in their own service; the value whereof shall be paid by the other party on a mutual adjusment of accounts for the subsistence of prisoners at the close of the war: and the said accounts shall not be mingled with, or set off against any others, nor the ballances due on them be witheld as a satisfaction or reprisal for any other article, or for any other cause real or pretended whatever: that each party shall be allowed to keep a commissary of prisoners of their own appointment with every seperate cantonment of prisoners in possession on the other, which commissary shall see the prisoners as often as he pleases, shall be allowed to receive &amp; distribute whatever necessaries may be sent to them by their friends, &amp; shall be free to make his reports in open letters to those who employ him. But if any officer shall break his parole, or any other prisoner shall escape from the limits of his cantonment, after they shall have been disignated to him, such individual officer or other prisoner shall forfeit so much of the benefit of this article as provides for his enlargement on parole or cantonment. And it is declared that neither the pretence that war dissolves all treaties, nor any other whatever shall be considered as annulling or suspending this &amp; the next preceding article, but on the contrary that the state of war is precisely that for which they are provided, and during which they are to be as sacredly observed as the most acknowled articles in the law of nature &amp; nations.

world, that they willnot adopt any fuch praétice ; thatneither will fend the pri-  
foners, whom they may take from the other, into the Ealt Indies, or any other parts  
of Afiaor Africa; but that they fhall be placed in fome part of thet dominions  
in Europe or Ameviea, in wholefome fituations ; that they fha:l not be confined in  
dungeons, prifon-thips, nor prifons; nor be put into irons, nor bound, nor other-  
wife refrained in the ufe of their limbs; that the officers thall be enlarged on their  
paroles within convenient diftriéts, and have comfortable quarters ; and the com-  
mon men be difpofed in cantonments, open and extenfive enough for air and exer-  
cife, and lodged in barracks, as roomy and good as are provided by the party, in  
whofe power they are, for their own troops ; that the officers fhall alfo be daily  
furnithed by the party, in whofe power they are, with as many rations, and of  
the fame articles and quality, as are allowed by them, either in kind or by com.  
mutation, to officers of equal rank in their own army ; and ali others thall be daily  
furnithed by them with fuch rations as they allow to a common {oidier in their own  
fervice ; the value whereof fhall be paid by the other party, on mutual adjuftment  
of accounts, for the fubfittence of prifoners, at the clofe of the war: and the fai  
accounts fhall not be mingled with, or fet off againft, any others, nor the balances  
due on them, be withheld as a fatisfa&amp;tion or reprilal for any other article, or for  
any other caufe, real or pretended, whatever ; that each party fhail be allowed to

comforts may be fent to them by their friends ; and thall be free to make his re-  
ports in open letters to thofe who employ him: but if any officer fhall break his

they fhall have been defignated to him, fuch individual officer o other prifone:  
fhall forfeit fo much of the benefit ef this article, as provides tor his enlargement  
@n parole or cantonment. And it 1s declared, that neither the pretence, that war  
diffolves all treaties, nor any other whatever, fhali be confidered as annulling or  
fufpending this and the next preceding article; but on the contrary, that the ftate  
of war is precifely that for which they are provided, and during which they are

form not an unimportant article.  
  
But whatever were the errours of Franklin in respect to  
the negotiations for peace, it should be recorded to his honour,  
that he made a strenuous effort for introducing into the  
treaty the following article.  
  
‘If war should arise between the two contracting parties, the  
merchants of either country then residing in the other, shall be  
allowed to remain nine months to collect their debts and settle  
their affairs, and may depart freely, carrying off all their eilects

shall not be molested in their persons; nor shall their houses or  
cvods be burnt or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields wasted by  
the armed force of the enemy, into whose power, by the events  
of the war, they may happen to fall: but ifany thing is necessary  
to be taken from them for the use of such armed force, the same  
shall be paid for at a reasonable price. And all merchant and  
trading vessels, employed in exchanging the products of different  
places, and thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniences, and  
comforts of human life, more easy to be obtained, and more  
general, shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested ; and nei-

n more modern times the tendency of na­  
tions has been towards the discontinuance of  
this mode of warfare. The United States,  
from the foundation of the Governmnent, has  
acted persistently on the principle that pri­  
vate property should be exempt from cap­  
ture by armed vessels, and has lost no oppor­  
tunity to impress upon the nations with  
which it was in diplomatic intercourse the im­  
portance of prohibiting this mode of warfare  
by treaty stipulations. As early as 1785, in  
concluding a treaty with Prussia, it was stip­  
ulated that &quot;all merchant and trading vessels  
emyloyed in the exchange of the products of  
different places, and thereby rendering the ne­  
cessaries conveniences, and comforts of human  
life more easy to be obtained and more gene­  
ral, shall be allowed to pass free and unme­  
lested; and neither of the contracting powers  
shall grant or issue any commission to any  
private armed vessels, empowering them to  
take or destroy such trading vessels or inter­  
rupt such commerce.&quot; This stipulation was  
not renewed in the treaty of 1797. The treaty  
of the United States with the Netherlands in  
1782, France in 1788, England in 1794, Peru  
1799, Prussia 1795, and Spain 1735, contain  
provisions prohibiting the subjects of either  
power from taking letters of marque against  
the other from any power with which it is at  
war, under the penaly of being treated, if  
taken, as pirates.  
But notwithstanding these stipulations,  
the practice of the Government has always  
been to employ the services of privateers in  
the prosecution of its wars; and many of it

ties, as well as from the style of th.  
composition, we may guess from the  
following which was drawn by his own  
hand: &quot;If war should arise between  
the two contracting parties, the mer­  
chants of either country then residing  
in the other shall be allowed to remain  
nine months to collect their debts and  
to settle their affairs, and may depart  
freely, carrying off all their effects  
without molestation or hindrance. And  
all women and children, scholars of ev­  
ery faculty, cultivators of the earth, ar­  
tisans, manufacturers and fishermen,  
unarmed and inhabiting unfortified  
towns, villagesor places, and in gen­  
eral, all others whose occupations are  
for the common subsistence and bene­  
fit of mankind, shall be allowed to con­  
tinue their respective employments, and  
shall not be molested in their persons,  
nor shall their houses or goods be burnt  
or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields  
wasted by the armed forces of the ene­  
my, into whose power by the events of  
war they may happen to fall; but if  
anything is necessary to be taken from  
them for the use of such armed force,  
the same shall be paid for at a reasona­  
ble price, and all merchant and trading  
vessels employed in exchainging the  
products of different places, and there­  
by rendering the necessaries, conven­  
iences and comforts om human life  
more easy to be obtained, and more  
general, shall be allowed to pass free  
and unmolested; and neither of the  
contracting powers shall grant or is­  
sue any commission to any private  
armed vessels empowering them to take  
or destroy such trading vessels or in,  
terrupt such commerce.&quot;
