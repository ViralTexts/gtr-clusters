to be on the Thames, I enquired of our watermen whether they were sensible of any difference in rowing over shallow or deep water. I found them all agreeing in the fact, that there was a very great difference, but they differed widely in expressing the quantity of the difference; some supposing it was equal to a mile in six, others to a mile in three, &amp;c. As I did not recollect to have met with any mention of this matter in our philosophical books, and conceiving that if the difference should really be great, it might be an

whether they were sensible of any difference in rowing in shallow or

differed as to the amount; varying in their estimates from one mile in six  
to one in three.  
  
Not having seen this subject mentioned in any philosophical work, he  
determined to make an experiment to verify the fact. Having formed a  
trough to contain water, fourteen feet long, six inches wide, and six deep,  
and placed therein a little boat, which was moved by the means of a silk  
thread, pulley, and weight, he found that the difference of time, in seconds,
