It is said that the Persians in their ancient Constitution, had publick Schools in which Virtue was taught as a Liberal Art or Science; and it is certainly of more Consequence to a Man that he has learnt to govern his Passions; in spite of Temptation to be just in his Dealings, to be Temperate in his Pleasures, to support himself with Fortitude under his Misfortunes, to behave with Prudence in all Affairs and in every Circumstance of Life; I say, it is of much more real Advantage to him to be thus qualified, than to be a Master of all the Arts and Sciences in the World beside.

ever contrives Ill against his Neighbour, and therefore is never seen with a lowring suspicious Aspect. A mixture of Innocence and Wisdom makes him ever seriously chearful. His generous Hospitality to Strangers according to his Ability, his Goodness, his Charity, his Courage in the Cause of the Oppressed, his Fidelity in Friendship, his Humility, his Honesty and Sincerity, his Moderation and his Loyalty to the Government, his Piety, his Temperance, his Love to Mankind, his Magnanimity, his Publick-spiritedness, and in fine, his Consummate Virtue, make him justly deserve to be esteem’d the Glory of his Country.  
  
——The Brave do never shun the Light,  
Just are their Thoughts and open are their Tempers;  
Freely without Disguise they love and hate;  
Still are they found in the fair Face of Day,  
And Heaven and Men are Judges of their Actions.    Rowe.  
  
Who would not rather chuse, if it were in his Choice, to merit the above Character, than be the richest, the most learned, or the most powerful Man in the Province without it?  
Almost every Man has a strong natural Desire of being valu’d and esteem’d by the rest of his Species; but I am concern’d and griev’d to see how few fall into the Right and only infallible Method of becoming so. That laudable Ambition is too commonly misapply’d and often ill employ’d. Some to make themselves considerable pursue Learning, others grasp at Wealth, some aim at being thought witty, and others are only careful to make the most of an handsome Person; But what is Wit, or Wealth, or Form, or Learning when compar’d with Virtue? ’Tis true, we love the handsome, we applaud the Learned, and we fear the Rich and Powerful; but we even Worship and adore the Virtuous. Nor is it strange; since Men of Virtue, are so rare, so very rare to be found. If we were as industrious to become Good, as to make ourselves Great, we should become really Great by being Good, and the Number of valuable Men would be much increased; but it is a Grand Mistake to think of being Great without Goodness; and I pronounce it as certain, that there was never yet a truly Great Man that was not at the same Time truly Virtuous.

forward the essays of the ‘ Busy-Body,’ which Franklin gave toa  
Philadelphia newspaper in 1728—9. The youth of the writer is  
not betrayed in any part of them. ‘The style is that of a practised

we must be permitted to illustrate by a single passage.

ir doom is said.  
  
Pass a century—their bonds are riven;  
  
Then, and only then, to them is given  
The Elysium of the honored dead.  
  
  
  
GLOVES AND IIAT.  
Wear seemly gloves; not black, nor yet too light,  
And least of all the pair that once was white ;  
Let the dead party where you told your loves  
Bury in peace its dead bouquets and gloves;  
Shave like the goat. if so your fancy bids,  
But be a parent—don’t neglect your kids.  
Have a good hat, the secret of your looks  
Lives with the beaver in Canadian brooks;  
Virtue may flourish in an old cravat,
