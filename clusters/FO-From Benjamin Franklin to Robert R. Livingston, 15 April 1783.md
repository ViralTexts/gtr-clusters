There is not a Port in France, and few in Europe, from which I have not received several Applications of Persons desiring to be appointed Consuls for America. They generally offer to execute the Office for the honour of it, without Salary. I suppose the Congress will wait to see what Course the Commerce will take, and in what Places it will fix itself, in order to find where Consuls will be necessary, before any Appointments are made; and perhaps it will then be thought best to send some of our own People. If they are not allow’d to Trade there must be a great Expence for Salaries. If they may trade and are Americans, the Fortunes they make will mostly settle at last in our own Country. The Agreement I was to make here respecting Consuls has not yet been concluded. The Article of Trading is important. I think it would be well to reconsider it.  
I have caused to be struck here the Medal which I formerly mentioned to you, the Design of which you seem’d to approve. I inclose one of them in Silver for the President of Congress, and one in Copper for yourself: The Impression on Copper is thought to appear best; and you will soon receive a Number for the Members. I have presented one to the King and another to the Queen both in Gold; &amp; one in silver to each of the Ministers, as a monumental Acknowledgement which may go down to future Ages, of the Obligations we are under to this Nation. It is mighty well received, and gives general Pleasure. If the Congress approve of it, as I hope they will, I may add something on the Die (for those to be struck hereafter) to shew that it was done by their Order, which I could not venture to do ’till I had Authority for it.  
A multitude of People are continually applying to me Personally and by Letters, for Information respecting the means of transporting themselves, Families and For

The ministers, as these quotations indicate, favored the  
selection by Congress of American citizens for consular posi-  
tions. Congress also was at that time more hostile than it was  
later to the appointment of foreign merchants. The first action  
concerning the consular service, taken by Congress after the  
close of the war, was the passage of a resolution, March 16,  
1784, which declared “ that it is inconsistent with the interests  
of the United States to appoint any person not a citizen thereof
