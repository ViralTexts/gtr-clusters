I heard your Letter read in Congress relating to the Disposition of the German Troops; and understanding from Col. Ross, that they are canton’d on the Island opposite to the Jersey Shore, I send you herewith some of the Resolutions of the Congress translated into their Language, as possibly you may find some Opportunity of conveying them over the Water, to those People. Some of the Papers have Tobacco Marks on the Back, it being suppos’d by the Committee, that if a little Tobacco were put up in each as the Tobacconists use to do, and a Quantity made to fall into the Hands of that Soldiery, by being put into a Drift Canoe among some other little Things, it would be divided among them as Plunder before the Officers could know the Contents of the Paper and prevent it. With great Esteem, I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant  
B Franklin  
Col. McKean

German troops and understanding from Col: Ross that they are can-  
toned on the Island opposite to the Jersey Shore I send you herewith  
some of the Resolutions of Congress translated into their language as  
possibly you may find some opportunity of conveying them over the  
water to these people.—Some of the papers have tobacco marks on the  
back, it being supposed by the Committee that if a little tobacco were  
put up in Each as the Tobacconists use to do and a quantity made to  
fall into the hands of that soldiery by being put into a Drift Canoe  
among some other little — it would be divided among them as  
plunder, before the officers could know of the contents of the paper and  
prevent it.  
With great esteem, I am  
Your most obed&#x27; humble serv‘  
B. FRANKLIN
