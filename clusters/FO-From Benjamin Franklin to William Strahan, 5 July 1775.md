 papers. The negative evidence is that Strahan later gave no sign that he had received such a blast: when he responded on September 6 to a letter, now lost, from Franklin two days after this one, and when he wrote again on October 4, he showed the pain and sorrow that one friend reserves for the other’s delusions, and also the implicit assumption that the relationship remained intact. On the rare occasions when Franklin lost his temper he was likely to recover it quickly. This outburst was an example in point: it relieved his rage at what was happening, and went no further.  
  
Mr. Strahan,  
Philada. July 5. 1775  
You are a Member of Parliament, and one of that Majority which has doomed my Country to Destruction. You have begun to burn our Towns, and murder our People. Look upon your Hands! They are stained with the Blood of your Relations! You and I were long Friends: You are now my Enemy, and I am, Yours,  
B Franklin

printed on the face, the ominous warning, ‘To  
counterfeit is Death,” and the figure of a leaf  
appear on the back. The leaf, which resembles a

it has the appearance of having been engraved from

m expressed repartee we  
find that there can be no less wit in the  
manner in which writers subscribe  
themselves. For instance, we have it  
upon record that, when Glengarry  
claimed the chief tansbip of theMacdon­  
ald clan, the generally acknowledged  
chief wrote him as follows:  
. My. Dear Glengarry—As soon as  
you can prove yourself my chief 1 shall  
be ready to acknowledge :■■ you. In the  
meantime lam yours, Macdonald. .  
This letter may have suggested ■ to  
Benjamin franklin the.note lie wrote  
to a friend in England when the Ameri­  
can colonies declared . their Independ­  
ence, and which closed thus:  
You and I were long friends. .You are  
now my enemy and I am yours.
