No other worship abides and endures<br/>

yours<br/>
None like a mother can charm away<br/>

From the pick soul ana tne worm-<br/>

Slumbers soft calms oer my heavy<br/>

Rock me to sleep mother rock me<br/>

Come lot your brown hair just<br/>
lighted with gold<br/>
Fall on your shoulders agalnjas of old<br/>
Let it drop over my forehead to night<br/>
Shading my faint eyes away from the<br/>
light<br/>
For with its sunny edged shadows<br/>
once moro<br/>
Haply will throng tho sweet visions<br/>
of yore<br/>
Lovingly softly its bright billows<br/>

sweep<br/>
Rock me to sleep mother rock mo<br/>

been long<br/>
Since I last Hsted to your lullaby<br/>

The pausing of years has been only a<br/>
dream<br/>
Clasped to your heart ln a loving<br/>
