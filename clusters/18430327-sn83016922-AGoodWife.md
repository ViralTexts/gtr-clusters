A Good Wife  
Is to man, wisdom and courage and strength. No condition is hopeless-, when the wife possesses firmness, de­cision, energy and economy. Man is strong, but his heart is not ada­mant, lie delights in enterprise and action, but to sustain him, he need a tranquil mind and a whole heart. He expends his whole moral force in the conflicts of the world. His feelings are daily lacerated to the utmost point of endurance, by perpetual collision, irritation and disappointment. To recover his equanimity and composure, home must be to him, a place of repose, of peace, cheerfulness, of com forts: and his soul renews its strength, and again goes forth with fresh vigor, to encounter the labors and troubles of the world. Let woman know then. that she ministers at the very foun­tain of life and happiness. Her ardent spirit breathes the breath of life into all her enterprises. Her patience and constancy are mainly instrumental in carrying out to completion the best human designs. Her more delicate moral sensibility is ever at work, to purify and refine society and the nearest glimpse of heaven that mortals ever can get on earth, is that domestic circle, which her hand have trained to intelligence, virtue and love: which her gentle influence pervades, and of which her radiant presence is the centre and the sun.

 Good Wife.  
  
The influence of the good wife is immense.  
Her tasks are certainly a few. If the seat of  
happiness is not home, happiness is forever  
unknown. A good wife tasks her mind to  
establish it there. A good wife is to a man,  
wisdom, courage, strength, hope, and endur-  
ance. A bad one, confusion, weakness, dis-  
comfiture, and despair. No condition is hope-  
less, when the wife has firmness, energy, and  
economy. Man is strong; but his heart is  
not adamant. He delights in enterprise and  
action, but to sustain him, he needs a tranquil  
mind, and a whole herri. He expends all his  
moral force in the moral confliets of the world.  
His feelings are lacerated to the utmost point  
of endurance, by perpetual collision, irrita-  
tion, and disappointment. To recover his  
equanimity and eomposure, home must be to  
him a place of repose, of peace, of cheerful-  
ness, of comfort; his soul, then, renews his  
strength, and he again goes forth with fresh  
vigour to encounter the labor and troubles of  
the world. But if at home he finds no rest,  
and there is met with bad temper, or is assail-  
ed by discontent, complaint, and reproaches,  
the heart breaks, the spirits are crushed,  
hope vanishes, and the man sinks into des-

THE GOOD, WIFE.  
There can be no doubt whatever but that a good  
wife is a great blessing, and it is equally true that  
all wives desire to be good. Many, however, think  
they can be good without exertion. This is an  
error. Mental exertion, and sometimes sacrifice  
of feeling, is required. But see the reward. The  
influence of a good wife is immense. The power  
of a wife for good or exil, is irresistible. ﬁ)ome  
must be the seat of hnp{piness, or it must be forever  
unknown. A good wife is to a man wisdom and  
courage, and strength and endurance. A bad one  
is confusion, weakness, discomfiture and despair.  
No condition is hopeless when the wife possesses  
firmness, decision and economy. There is no out­  
ward prosperity which can. counteract indolence,  
folly and extravagance at home. No spirit can  
long resist bad domestic influence. Man is strong, ‘  
but his heart is not adamant. He delights in enter- 1  
prise and action ; but to sustain him: he needs a  
tranquil mind and 2 whole heart. He expends his  
whole moral force in conflicts with the world. To  
recover his equanimity and composure, home must  
be to him a place of repose, of peace, of cheerful­  
ness, of comfort, and his soul renews its strength  
and again goes forth with fresh vigor to encounter  
the ln%)or and troubles of the world. But, if at  
home he finds no rest, and is there met with bad

The power of a wife for good or evil is  
irresistible. Home must be the seat of  
happiness, or it must be forever unknown.  
A good wife is to a man wisdom and courage,  
and strength and endurance. A bad one is  
confusion, weakness, discomfiture and  
despair. No condition is hopeless where  
the wife possesses firmness, decision, and  
economy. There is no outward prosperity  
which can counteract indolence extrav­  
egance and, folly at home. No spirit can  
long endure bad domestic influence. Man  
is strong, but his heart is not adamant.  
He delights in enterprise and action; but to  
sustain him he needs a tranquil mind, and  
a whole heart. He needs his moral force in  
the conflicts of the world. To recover his  
equanimity and composure, home must be  
to him a place of repose, of cheerfulness,  
of comfort; and his soul reoews his strongth  
again, and goes forth with fresh vigor to  
encounter the labors and troubles of life.  
But if at home he finds no rest, and is there  
met with bad temper, sullenness or gloom,  
or is assailed by discontent or complaint,  
hope vanishes, and he sinks into despair.

are fine manners, but this: to carry your  
soul on your lips, and your eye in the palin

but clothed by your individual quality  
visible, yet inscrutable,-given to the hearts  
of others, yet contained on your own bosom  
nobly and humancly opon, yet duly re­

There is no outward prosperity which can  
long counteract indolence, folly and extrav-  
agance at home. No spirit can long resist  
bad domestic arrangements. Manis strong  
but his heart is not adamant. He delights  
in enterprise and action, but to sustain him  
he needs a tranquil mind. He expends his  
whole moral force in his conflicts with the  
world. His teelings are daily lacerated to

and composure, home must be to him a  
place of repose and peace, of cheerfulness  
and comfort; and his soul renews its  
strength and again goes forth with fresh  
vigor to encounter the troubles of the  
world. But if at home he finds no rest; is  
met by a bad temper, sullenness or gloom,  
the heart breaks, the spirits are crushed,  
hope vanishes. and the man sinks into total  
despair. Let the wife know, then, that she  
ministers at the very fountain of life and  
happiness. It is her hand that gives the  
cup of refreshing water, or casts into that  
cup the branch of bitterness which makes  
it poison and death. Her ardent spirit  
breathes the breath of life into all enter-

A Wife&#x27;s Power. The power of a wife for  
good or evil is irresistible. Home must  
be the seat of happiness, or it must be  
for ever unknown. A good wife is to a  
man wisdom and courage and strength and  
endurance. A bad wife is confusion,  
weakness, discomfiture, and despair. No  
condition is hopeless where the wife  
possesses firmness, decision, and  
economy. There is an outward prosperity  
which can counteract indolence,  
extravagance, aud folly at home. No  
spirit can long endure bad domestic  
influence. Man is strong, but his heart  
is not adamant ! He delishts in  
pntamrisp. and action, but, to sustain  
him, he needs a tranquil mind, and a  
whole heart. He needs his moral force in  
the couflicts of the world. To recover  
his equanimity and composure, home must  
be to him a place of repose, of peace,  
of cheerfulness, of comfort, and his  
soul renews its strength again, and goes  
forth with fresh vigour to encounter the
