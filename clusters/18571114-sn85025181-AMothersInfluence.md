A Mother&#x27;s influence.  
  
Hon. Thomas H. Benton, in a speech in New York, turned to the ladies, and referring to his mother, said,  &quot;My mother asked me never to use tobacco, and I have never touched it from that time to the present day. She asked me not to game, and I have never gamed; and I can&#x27;t tell this day who is winning and who is losing in games that can be played. She admonished me too, against hard drink ; and whatever capacity for endurance I may have at present, and whatever usefulness I may attain in life&#x27;, I attribute to having complied with her pious and earnest wishes. When seven years of age, she asked me not to drink, and I made then a resolution to total abstinence. I formed an abstinence society at a time when I was the sole constituent member of my own body, and that I have adhered to it through all time, I owe to my mother.&quot;&quot;

‘¢There is a weed which no animal of the brute creation will touch, dried

another speaker, who has given us a notice  
very properly of two things which were  
carried from the new world to the old. I  
join him heartily with a limitation in one  
of them; that is a pretty fair compromise,  
although I am not a man of compromises.  
Laughter.! One of those things was a  
weed which no animal of the brute creation  
will touch, dried or green--which not even  
the browsing goat, or the rooting hog, or the  
mule that feeds upon thistles and briars, will  
touch; yet man will take it and put it into  
his nose, and fill his month with it, and even  
light a fire under his nose to heat it with.  
My mother asked me never to use the weed,  
and I have never touched it from that time  
to the present day. And now for something  
more serious. She asked me never to game,  
and I never have gamed; and I cannot tell  
this day who is winning and who is losing  
in any game that can be played. She ad­  
nionished me, too, against hard drink; and  
whatever usefullness I may attain in life,  
I attribute to having complied with her  
pious and earnest wishes.  
  
When seven years of age, she asked me  
not to drink, and I made then a resolution  
of total abstinence, long before societies for  
that purpose were formed. I was an absti­

ppressed lie, the poi­  
sonous insinuation, the malignant inuendo,  
are adroitly arranged to injure your reputa­  
tion, or to embitter your friends against you,  
by those who, were they not dead to all sense  
of gratitude, would pronounce your mane  
only to invoke blessings upon your pathway.  
  
Such is sometimes life. But there is  
another side to the picture. It is better to  
suffer than to do wrong. The coals of fire  
on the head of an enemy will not fail, sooner  
or later, to melt the ice surrounding, and  
soften and purify the heart. Then the ene- -  
my is slain ; a friend is created.  
  
THE Two IVoaLns.—There is a World  
where no storms intrude—a heaven of safety  
against the tempest of life, a little world of  
joy and love, of innocence and tranquility.  
Suspicions are not there, nor jealousies; nor  
falsehood, with their double - longue, nor the  
venom of slander. Peace embracing there.  
&#x27;When a man entered&#x27; it, he forgets his sor­  
rows, and cares, and disappointments; he  
opens his heart to confidence, and to pleasure  
not mingled with remorse. This world is the  
home of a virtuous and amiable woman.

The disposal of kingdoms is in the hands of God, and their

Laughter is as healthful to the body as gladness is to the  
mind; and there is not a more beautiful spectacle than a  
smiling face when you know it is the true index of the soul  
within. We do not speak of that species of idiotic laughter  
which is sure to follow the exhibition of any low trick, or the  
utterance of a coarse jest—but that genial outburst that en-  
livens the social circle when men, like true philosophers, for-  
get their past cares, and put off till the morrow all appre-  
hensions regarding the future.

&#x27;compelled to trepass upon your courtesy.  
1 will, however, &quot;confiue myself to the  
correction of one erroneous statement.  
Jo say, as these reports have done, that  
jl &quot; denounced the doctrine of eternal  
punishment,&quot; or expressed a hope that  
jthe word eternal&#x27;, might not appear in  
tiie He vised translation, is, as most of  
pour readers will have seen at a glance,  
ptter iionsense. The object of ray ser­  
bon was to prove that the word &quot;eter­

m laith mi the possible effects of  
prist&#x27;s infinite redemption even-&#x27; be-  
pond the grave, which seems to be most  
fipressly stated in the text from which  
preached (1 Pet. iv. G). Neither the

Canon Iiri-a.r on vox-lusting&#x27;  
I&#x27;ttni.olimen t.  
Cannon rarrar recently delivered a  
sermon in Westminister abbey concern  
ing future punishment, which has been  
extensively commented on both in Eng  
land and this country. An exaggerated  
account of his statements having been  
made, Dr. Farrar sent the following  
communication to the Guardian about  
the matter:  
Sik Since many complete misrepre­  
sentations of the language and purport  
of a sermon which I recently preached  
in Westminister abbey have found their  
way to public notices, I am reluctantly  
compelled to trepass upon your courtesy.  
I will, however, confine myself to the  
correction of one erroneous statement.  
To say, as these reports have done, that  
I &quot; denounced the doctrine of eternal  
punishment,&quot; or expressed a hope that  
the word &quot;oternal&#x27;, might not appear in  
the Revised translation, is, as most of  
your readers will have seen at a glance,  
utter nonsense. The object of my ser­  
mon was to prove that the word &quot;eter­  
nal&quot; did not necessarily connote &quot;endless  
ness;&quot; and at the same time to vindicate  
that faith in the possible effects of  
Christ&#x27;s infinite redemption even be­  
yond the grave, which seems to be most  
expressly stated in the text from which  
I preached (1 Pet. iv. 6). Neither the  
Anglican, nor even (I believe) the Rom­  
ish church, has dogmatically decided  
against the permissibility of such a hope; j  
and as is known to all the students of i  
church history it has been widely held&#x27;  
in ditrerent ages, both by the very emi  
nent fathers and theologians, and by  
some cf the holiest of the saints of God.  
F. W. Faerak.  
Prayer. Mr. Tennyson has written  
some beautiful things about prayer. In  
his &quot;Harold&quot; he makes Edith say:  
God help me! I know nothing can but  
pray  
For Harold pray, pray, pray, no help but  
prayer,  
A breath that fleets beyond this iron world,  
And touches Him that made it.  
That is exquisite. It reminds us of  
the saying, &quot;Prayer moves the hand  
that moves the world.&quot; Perhaps the  
poet laureate got his idea from it.  
Nashville Advocate.  
A. Mother&#x27;s Influence.  
- The late Thomas II. Benton who so  
long in public life and surrounded by  
temptations, paid the following tribute  
to his mother:  
&quot;Mv mother asked me never to use  
any tobacco, and I have never touched  
it from that time to the present day ; she  
asked me not to game, and I have not,  
and I cannot tell who is winning or who  
is losing in gamea that can be played.  
She admonished me, too, against hard  
drinking, and whatever capacity&#x27; for en­  
durance I may have at present and what­  
ever usefulness I may attain in life, 1  
attribute it to having complied with her  
pious and correct wishes. When I was  
seven years of age she asked me not to  
drink, and then I made a resolution of  
total abstinence, at a time when I was  
sole constituent member of my own body,  
and that I have adhered to it through  
all the time, I owe to my mother.&quot;

SOUNDS OF THE SABBATH BELLS.  
  
Oh, no, there i no darning hell !  
Said the Universalis! bell ;  
Look up to heaven this holy day,  
Attend this church and learn I lie way ;  
There are no fires, no frlendi to blight  
The hope within the heart that&#x27;s right;  
No hell I no hell I no hell I no hell I  
Do well I do well I do well I do well !  
Said the Unitarian bell ;  
Come here and cast aside your load,  
And wori your way along tbe road,  
With faith In God and faith in man,  
And hope la Christ where hope began ;  
Do well I do well I do well I do well I  
Bald the Unitarian bell.  
Swell I swell! swell! swell! ye wa&#x27;en, swell I  
Exclaimed, In peals, tbe Baptist bell ;  
While faith In Christ alone can save,  
Man must be plunged beneath the wave,  
To show the world unfaltering faith  
In what the sacred scripture salth ;  
Swell I swell I swell I swell I ye waters, iwoll I  
Exclaimed, In peals, the Baptist bell.  
Farewell I farewell I base world, farewell!  
Cried out the Presbyterian bell ;  
Life Is a boon, to mortals given,  
And there la nothing true but heaven ;  
Do not provoke the avenging rod  
Come here and learn tbe will of God ;  
Farewell! farewell! base world, farewell!  
Cried out the Presbyterian bell,  
We tell Uie truth ! wo tell ! we tell !  
Shouted the Methodistic bell ;  
Our Lord has made salvation free,  
None need be lost on land or sea ;  
Repent, believe, have hope, and then,  
Be saved and praise the Lord Amen !  
The truth we toll ! we tell! we tell !  
Shouted the Methodistic bell.  
Excel ! excel ! In love excel !  
Chimed the Episcopalian bell;  
This Is the church not built on sands­  
Emblem of one not built with hands,  
Its forms, and rules, and rites revere  
And worship here come worship here ;  
Excel In faith and works, excel !  
Chimed tbe Episcopalian bell,  
Look down, ye saints, In heaven and dwell 1  
Shouted the Roman Catholic bell!  
Lean o&#x27;er the battlements of bliss,  
And deign to bless a world like this ;  
Let mortals kneel beforo this shrine,  
Here Is the water, here the wine ;  
Look down, ye saints, in heaven that dwell !  
Exclaimed the Roman Catholio bell.  
O&#x27;er city&#x27;s streets or hlll-slde dell  
Ring on, each Heaven-assuring bell !  
Press forward, pilgrims, to the shrine  
Of Calvary and Palestine;  
These paths that lead through earthly dross,  
All meet at last beneath the Cross,  
The Christian does not fear the knell,  
As aiiL&#x27;els toll the funeral bell.

the value of the influence which she exerted  
over him.  
“My mother asked me never to use any  
tobacco, and I have never touched it from that  
time to the present day ; she asked me not to  
game, and I have not, and i cannot tell who is  
winning or who is losing in games that  
can be played. She admonished me, too,  
against hard drinking, and whatever capa­  
city I may have for endurance at present,  
and whatever usefulness I may attain in life, I  
attribute it to .having complied with her pious  
and correct wishes. When I was seven years  
of age she asked me not to drink, and then I  
made a resolution of total abstinence, at a time  
when I was sole constituent member of my  
own body, and that I have adhered to it through  
all the time, I owe to my mother.”
