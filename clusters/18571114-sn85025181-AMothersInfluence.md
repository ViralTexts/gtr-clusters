A Mother&#x27;s influence.  
  
Hon. Thomas H. Benton, in a speech in New York, turned to the ladies, and referring to his mother, said,  &quot;My mother asked me never to use tobacco, and I have never touched it from that time to the present day. She asked me not to game, and I have never gamed; and I can&#x27;t tell this day who is winning and who is losing in games that can be played. She admonished me too, against hard drink ; and whatever capacity for endurance I may have at present, and whatever usefulness I may attain in life&#x27;, I attribute to having complied with her pious and earnest wishes. When seven years of age, she asked me not to drink, and I made then a resolution to total abstinence. I formed an abstinence society at a time when I was the sole constituent member of my own body, and that I have adhered to it through all time, I owe to my mother.&quot;&quot;
