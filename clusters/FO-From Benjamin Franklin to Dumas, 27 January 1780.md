Passy Jan. 27. 1780.  
I received yours of the 10th. Instant. I Shall be glad to learn how the taking of the Dutch Ships has been accommodated. We have yet no News of the alliance: but suppose she is cruizing. We are more in Pain for the Confederacy, who Sailed the 28th Oct. from the Capes of Deleware. There is some Hopes that She went to Charlestown to take in Mr. Lawrens; for some Passengers arrived in France who left Philada Several weeks after her Sailing, Say that it was a general opinion she would call there before She Departed for Europe. If this was not the Case, we fear she must be lost, and the Loss will be a Very severe one.  
  
I Send you inclosed a Translation of a Letter, that I think I sent you the original before. Perhaps it may serve our Leiden Friend.  
I am Sorry you have any Difference With the ambassador, and wish you to accommodate it as soon as possible. Depend upon it that no one ever knew from me that you had spoken or written against any Person. There is one concerning whom I think you sometimes receive erroneous Information. In one particular I know you were misinformed, that of his Selling us arms at an Enormous Profit, the Truth is we never bought any of him.  
I am ever with great Esteem Dear Sir, your most obedient humble Servant

Passy, January 27, 1780.  
Dear Sir,  
  
I received your’s of the tenth instant. I shall  
be glad to learn how the taking of the Dutch  
ships has been accommodated. We have yet  
no news of the Alliance: but suppose she is  
cruising. We are more in pain for the Confede-  
racy, who sailed the twenty-eighth of October  
from the capes of Delaware. ‘There is some  
hope that she went to Charleston, to take in  
Mr. Laurens; for some passengers arrived in  
France, who left Philadelphia several wecks  
after her sailing, say that it was a general opinion  
she would call there before she departed for  
Europe. If this was not the case, we fear she  
must be lost, and the loss will be a very severe  
one.  
  
I send you, inclosed, a translation of a letter,  
that I think 1 sent you the original of before.  
Perhaps it may serve our Leyden friend.  
  
Iam sorry you have any difference with the  
ambassador, and wish you to accommodate it as  
soon as possible. Depend upon it that no one  
ever knew, from me, that you had spoken or  
written against any person. ‘There is one con-  
cerning whom | think you sometimes receive  
erroneous information. In one particular I know  
you were misinformed, that of his selling us  
arms at an enormous profit; the truth is, we  
never bought any of him.  
  
I am ever, with great esteem,  
Dear Sir,  
Your most obedient  
Humble servant,  
  
B. FRANKLIN.  
  
Mr. Dumas.
