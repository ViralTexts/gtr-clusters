2, the year Franklin left England at the close of his first mission. It is included here, however, at the end of 1764, the last year in which Peter Franklin spent any time in Newport.  
  
Dear Brother,  
[Before 1765]  
***I like your ballad, and think it well adapted for your purpose of discountenancing expensive foppery, and encouraging industry and frugality. If you can get it generally sung in your country, it may probably have a good deal of the effect you hope and expect from it. But as you aimed at making it general, I wonder you chose so uncommon a measure in poetry, that none of the tunes in common use will suit it. Had you fitted it to an old one, well known, it must have spread much faster than I doubt it will do from the best new tune we can get compos’d for it. I think too, that if you had given it to some country girl in the heart of the Massachusets, who has never heard any other than psalm tunes, or Chevy Chace, the Children in the Wood, the Spanish Lady, and such old simple ditties, but has naturally a good ear, she might more probably have made a pleasing popular tune for you, than any of our masters here, and more proper for your purpose, which would best be answered, if every word could as it is sung be understood by all that hear it, and if the emphasis you intend for particular words could be given by the singer as well as by the reader; much of the force and impression of the song depending on those circumstances. I will however get it as well done for you as I can.  
Do not imagine that I mean to depreciate the skill of our composers of music here; they are admirable at pleasing practised ears, and know how to delight one another; but, in composing for songs, the reigning taste seems to be quite out of nature, or rather the reverse of nature, and yet like a torrent, hurries them all away with it; one or two perhaps only excepted.  
You, in the spirit of some ancient legislators, would influence the manners of your country by the united powers of poetry and music. By what I can learn of their songs, the music was simple, conformed itself to the usual pronunciation of words, as to measure, cadence or emphasis, &amp;c. never disguised and confounded the language by making a long syllable short, or a short one long when sung; their singing was only a more pleasing, because a melodious manner of speaking; it was capable of all the graces of prose oratory, while it added the pleasure of harmony. A modern song, on the contrary, neglects all the proprieties and beauties of common speech, and in their place introduces its defects and absurdities as so many graces. I am afraid you will hardly take my word for this, and therefore I must endeavour to support it by proof. Here is the first song I lay my hand on. It happens to be a composition of one of our greatest masters, the ever famous Handel. It is not one of his juvenile performances, before his taste could be improved and formed: It appeared when his reputation was at the highest, is greatly admired by all his admirers, and is really excellent in its kind. It is called, The additional Favourite Song in Judas Maccabeus. Now I reckon among the defects and improprieties of common speech, the following, viz.  
1. Wrong placing the accent or emphasis, by laying it on words of no importance, or on wrong syllables.  
2. Drawling; or extending the sound of words or syllables beyond their natural length.  
3. Stuttering; or making many syllables of one.  
4. Unintelligibleness; the result of the three foregoing united.  
5. Tautology; and  
6. Screaming, without cause.  
For the wrong placing of the accent, or emphasis, see it on the word their instead of being on the word vain.  
  
And on the word from, and the wrong syllable like.  
  
For the Drawling, see the last syllable of the word wounded.  
  
And in the syllable wis, and the word from, and syllable bove  
  
For the Stuttering, see the words ne’er relieve, in  
  
Here are four syllables made of one, and eight of three; but this is moderate. I have seen in another song that I cannot now find, seventeen syllables made of three, and sixteen of one; the latter I remember was the word charms; viz. Cha, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, arms. Stammering with a witness!  
For the Unintelligibleness; given this whole song to any taught singer, and let her sing it to any company that have never heard it; you shall find they will not understand three words in ten. It is therefore that at the oratorio’s and operas one sees with books in their hands all those who desire to understand what they hear sung by even our best performers.  
  
For the Tautology; you have, with their vain mysterious art, twice repeated; Magic charms can ne’er relieve you, three times. Nor can heal the wounded heart, three times. Godlike wisdom from above, twice; and, this alone can ne’er deceive you, two or three times. But this is reasonable when compared with the Monster Polypheme, the Monster Polypheme, a hundred times over and over, in his admired Acis and Galatea.  
As to the screaming; perhaps I cannot find a fair instance in this song; but whoever has frequented our operas will remember many. And yet here methinks the words no and e’er, when sung to these notes, have a little of the air of screaming, and would actually be scream’d by some singers.  
  
I send you enclosed the song with its music at length. Read the words without the repetitions. Observe how few they are, and what a shower of notes attend them: You will then perhaps be inclined to think with me, that though the words might be the principal part of an ancient song, they are of small importance in a modern one; they are in short only a pretence for singing. I am, as ever, Your affectionate brother,  
B.F.  
P. S. I might have mentioned Inarticulation among the defects in common speech that are assumed as beauties in modern singing. But as that seems more the fault of the singer than of the composer, I omitted it in what related merely to the composition. The fine singer in the present mode, stifles all the hard consonants, and polishes away all the rougher parts of words that serve to distinguish them one from another; so that you hear nothing but an admirable pipe, and understand no more of the song, than you would from its tune played on any other instrument. If ever it was the ambition of musicians to make instruments that should imitate the human voice, that ambition seems now reversed, the voice aiming to be like an instrument. Thus wigs were first made to imitate a good natural head of hair; but when they became fashionable, though in unnatural forms, we have seen natural hair dressed to look like wigs.

T LIKE your baliad very well, and I  
  
tink it well adapted for your pur-  
pele of difcouraging expenfive fop-  
tery, and encouraging induftry and  
frugality. It you can getit generally  
{iin In your country, it may proba-  
oly have a good dea! of the effeét you  
hope and expeét from it. Butas you  
aimed at making it general, I wonder  
you chofe fo uncommon a meafure in  
poetry, that none of the tunes in  
conmmnon ufe will fuit it. Had you  
Hited it to an old one, well known, it  
  
muft have fpread much fafter than I  
doubt it will do from the beft new  
tune we can get compofed tor it. I  
think too, that if you had given it to  
fome country girl in the heart of  
Maffachufetts, who has never heard  
any other than pfalm tunes or Chev  
Chace, the Children in the Wood, the  
Spanyb Lady, and fuch old fimple  
ditties, but has naturally a good ear,  
fhe might more probably have made  
a pleafing popular tune for you, than  
apy of eur matiers here, and more  
proper

Dr. Frankhn&#x27;s Cr  
  
proper for your purpofe, which would  
beit be aniwered, it every word as it  
is tung be underitood by all that  
hear it, and if the emphatis you in-  
tend for particular words could be  
given by the Anger as well as by the  
reader ; much of the force and im-  
preflion of the fong depending on  
thofe circumftances. I will however  
get it as well done for you as I can.  
  
Do not imagine that 1 mean to de-  
preciate the {kill of our compofers of  
miulick here ; they are admirable at  
plealing pracdiifed ears, and know how  
to delight one another; but in com-  
poling for fongs the reigning tafte  
fecms tu be quite out of nature, or  
rather the reverfe of nature, and yet  
like a ‘orrent, hurries them all away  
with it ; one or two perhaps only ex-  
cepted.  
  
You, in the fpirit of fome ancient  
legillators, would influence the man-  
ners of your country by the united  
powers of poetry and mulick. By  
what ican learn of their fongs, the mu-  
fick was fiimpie, conformed itfelf to the  
ujual pronunciation of words, as to  
micalure, cadence, or emphafis, &amp;c.  
never dilguifed, or confounded the  
language by making a long fyllable  
hort, or a thort one long, when fung ;  
their finging was oaly a more pleafing,  
becaule a melodious manner of {peak-  
ing ; it was capable of all the graces  
of profe oratory, while it added the  
pleature of harmony.

A modern fong on the contrary,  
neylects ail the proprieties and beau-  
ties of common [peech, and in their  
place introduces its defecds and abjur-  
dities as 10 Many graces. 1am airaid  
you will hardly take my word for  
this, and theretore | mult endeavour  
to fupport it by proof. Here is the  
firit tong I lay my handon. It hap-  
pens to be a compofition of one of  
our greatelt mafiers, the ever famaus  
Handel. lt is not one of his juvenile  
  
vertormances, before his talte could  
e formed and improved. it appear-  
ed when his reputation was at the  
highett, is greatly admired by all his  
adinirers, and is really excellent in  
its kind. It is called, the additional  
Favourite Song, in Judas Maccabeus.  
Now I reckon among the defects and  
improprietics of common ipeech, the  
following, viz.  
  
1. Wrong placing the accent, or  
emphatis ; by laying 1t on words of ne  
importance, or on wrong fyllables.  
  
z.- Drawling; or extending the  
  
found of words, or fyllables beyond  
their natural length.  
  
3- Stuttering ; or making many  
fy liables of one.  
  
4- Unintelligiblenefs ; the refule  
of the three forgoing united. ;  
  
5. Tautology ; and,  
6. Screaming, without caufe.  
  
For the wrong placing of the accent, or emphafis, fee it on the word their, in-  
fiead of being on the word vazz ;

Here are four fyllables made of one,

word charms ; viz. Cha, a, a, a, a, a,

For the uni intelligiblenefs ; give  
this whole fong to any taught finger,  
and let her fing it to any company  
that have never heard it before ; and  
  
ou will find that they will not un-

therefore that at the oratorios and

For the tautology, you have, with

you, three times. Norcan heal the  
wounded heart, three times ; godlike  
wifdoin from above, twice : and this  
alone can ne’er deceive you, two or  
three times. But this is reafonable  
when compared with the monfter  
Polypeme, the montier Po lypheme, a  
hundree tim es over, and over, in his  
admired Acis and Galatea.  
  
As to the /creaming ; perhaps I can.  
not find a fair inftance in this fong,  
but whoever has frequented our ope.  
ras will remember many. And yet  
here methinks the words zo and e’er,  
when fung to the notes, have a little  
of the air of fcreaming, and would  
actually be fcreamed by fome fingers.  
  
  
  
  
  
No magick charms cane’er re - =~ lieve you.  
  
I fend you enclofed the fong w ith its  
mufick. Read the words without the  
repetitions. Obferve how few they  
are, and what a thower of notes at-  
tend them. You will then perhaps  
be inclined to think with me, that  
though the words might be the prin-  
c ipal | part of an ancie nt fong, they are  
ot {mall importance ina modern one ;  
they are in fhort only @ pretence for  
Singing.  
  
i might have mentioned inarticula-  
lation among the defects of con imon  
fpeech that are afflumed as beauties  
in modern finging ; but as that feem-  
ed more the fault of the finger than  
of the compofer, I omitted it in what  
yclated merely to the compofiion.  
  
The fine finger, in the prefent mode,  
ftifles all the hard confonants and po-  
lifhes away all the rougher parts of  
words that ferve to diltinguifh them  
one from another ; fo that you hear  
nothing but an admirable pipe, and  
underfand ho more of the fong than  
you would from its tune played « on any  
other initrument. If ever it was the  
ambition of muficians to make inftru-  
ments that thould imrtate the human  
voice, that ambition is now reverl-  
ed, the voice aiming to be like an in-  
Sounet nt. Thus wigs were firft made  
to imitate a good nat tral head of hair  
but when they became fafhionable,  
tho in unnatural forms, we have feea  
natural hair drefled to look like wigs.

LIKE your ballad very well, and |  
  
think it well adapted for your purpofe of  
difcouraging expeniive foppery, and en-  
couraging induftry and frugality. If you  
can get it generally fung in your country,  
it may probably have a good deal of the  
effe&amp;t you hope and expedt from it. But  
as you aimed at making it general, I won.  
der you chofe fo uncommon a mealure in  
poetry, that none of the tunes in common  
ule will fuit it. Had you fitted it to an old  
one, well known, it muft have {pread  
much fafter than I doubt it will do from the  
beft new tune we can get compofed for it.  
I think too, that if you had given it to  
fome country girl in the heart of Mafflachu-  
{etts who has never heard any other than  
plalm tunes or Chevy Chace, the Children  
in the Wood, the Spanifh Lady, and fuch  
old fimple ditties, but has naturally a good  
ear, fhe might more probably have made a  
pleafing popular tune for you, than any of  
our mafters here, and more proper for your  
purpofe, which would beft be anfwered, if  
every word, as it is dung, be underftood by  
all that hear it, and if the emphafis you  
intend for particular words, could be given  
by the finger as well as the reader ; much  
of the force and impreffion of the fong de-  
pending on thole circumftances. I will how-

me, that though the words niight be the

an extensive knowledge of the science of music.  
In a letter to Lord Kames, he exhibits a great  
mastery of this subject, and makes many very  
ingenious and valuable observations.  
  
In writing to his brother, Mr. Peter Franklin,

or Chevy Chase, the Children in the Wood, the  
Spanish Lady, and such old simple ditties, but  
has naturally a good ear, she might more proba-

than any of our masters here, and more proper  
for your purpose, which would best be an-  
swered if every word, as it is sung, be under-  
stood by all that hear it, and if the emphasis you  
intend for particular words, could be given by  
the singer as well as by the reader, much of the

There are four syllables made of one, and  
eight of three; but this is moderate. I have  
scen in another song that I cannot find, seven-  
teen syllables made of three, and sixteen of  
one: the latter, I remember, was charms; viz.,  
cha, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, U, a, a, a, a, arms.  
Stammering with a witness!  
  
“For the unintelligibleness, give this whole  
song to any taught singer, and let her sing it to  
any company that have never heard it; you will  
find they will not understand three words in ten.  
It is therefore that, at the oratorios and operas,  
one sees with books in their hands all those who  
desire to understand what they hear sung by

assumed as beauties in modern siuging.  
  
The fine singer in the  
present mode stifles all the hard consonants, and  
polishes away all the rougher parts of words  
that serve to distinguish them from each other ;  
so that you hear nothing but an admirable pipe,  
and understand no more of the song than you  
would from its time, played on any other instru-  
ment. If ever it was the ambition of musicians  
to make instruments that should imitate the  
human voice, that ambition seems now reversed,  
the voice aiming to be like an instrument.  
Thus, wigs were first made to imitate a good  
natural head of hair; but when they became  
fashionable, though in unnatural forms, we have  
  
seen natural hair dressed to look like wigs.”
