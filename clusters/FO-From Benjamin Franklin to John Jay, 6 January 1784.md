It is true, as you have heard, that I have the Stone, but not that I have had Thoughts of being cut for it. It is as yet very tolerable. It gives me no Pain, but when in a Carriage on the Pavement, or when I make some sudden quick Movement. If I can prevent its growing larger, which I hope to do by abstemious Living and gentle Exercise, I can go on pretty comfortably with it to the End of my Journey, which can now be at no great distance. I am chearful, enjoy the Company of my Friends, sleep well, have sufficient Appetite, and my Stomach performs well its Functions. The latter is very material to the Preservation of Health; I therefore take no Drugs lest I should disorder it. You may judge that my Disease is not very grievous, since I am more afraid of the Medicines than of the Malady

They continue however with every Dispatch to send a Copy of the Minute which directs the Commission to be prepared, as if it was thought we might act upon that, at least so far as to make the Convention for a Year. I send you enclos’d one of those authenticated Copies. It may serve as Ground for proposing a Conference with one of the new Ministers, in which you might discover whether they really intend a Treaty or not. If not, we can inform the Congress, and save them the Trouble of preparing the Plan.—  
I have, as you observe, some Enemies in England, but they are my Enemies as an American; I have also two or three in America, who are my Enemies as a Minister: but I thank God there are not in the whole World any who are my Enemies as a Man; for by his Grace thro’ a long Life I have been enabled so to conduct myself, that there does not exist a human Being who can justly say, Ben Franklin has wrong’d me. This, my Friend, is in old Age a comfortable Reflection. You too have, or may have, your Enemies: But let not that render you unhappy. If you make a right use of them they will do you more Good than Harm. They point out to us our Faults; they put us upon our guard; and help us
