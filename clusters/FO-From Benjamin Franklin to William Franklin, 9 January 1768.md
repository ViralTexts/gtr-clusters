London, Jan. 9, 1768.  
We have had so many alarms of changes which did not take place, that just when I wrote it was thought the ministry would stand their ground. However immediately after the talk was renewed, and it soon appeared the Sunday changes were actually settled. Mr. Conway resigns and Lord Weymouth takes his place. Lord Gower is made president of the council in the room of Lord Northington. Lord Shelburne is stript of the America business which is given to Lord Hillsborough as Secretary of State for America, a new distinct department. Lord Sandwich ’tis said comes into the Post Office in his place. Several of the Bedford party are now to come in. How these changes may affect us a little time will show. Little at present is thought of but elections which gives me hopes that nothing will be done against America this session, though the Boston gazette had occasioned some heats and the Boston resolutions a prodigious clamour. I have endeavoured to palliate matters for them as well as I can: I send you my manuscript of one paper, though I think you take the Chronicle. The editor of that paper one Jones seems a Grenvillian, or is very cautious as you will see, by his corrections and omissions. He has drawn the teeth and pared the nails of my paper, so that it can neither scratch nor bite. It seems only to paw and mumble. I send you also two other late pieces of mine. There is another which I cannot find.  
I am told there has been a talk of getting me appointed under secretary to Lord Hillsborough; but with little likelihood as it is a settled point here that I am too much of an American.  
I am in very good health, thanks to God: your affectionate fathe

 improve the vantage ground  
which he possessed in his controversies with the English  
ministry. Yet there appears to have been, during a part of  
the period of his agency, too much indecision and wavering  
in his politics, and too great a readiness to go over to the  
administration, who were, at different times, evidently desi-  
rous of gaining him to their party. It is remarkable that  
this fact has not been more adverted to since the publication  
of these volumes, considering the proofs of it which his letters  
furnish.

LoNDoN, 9 January, 1768.  
Dean Sin.. We have had so many alarms of  
changes which did not take place that just  
when I wrote it was thought the Ministry  
would stand their ground. However, immedi­  
ately after the talk was renewed, and it soon  
anpeared that the Nunday changes were actu  
ally settled. Mr. Conway resigns and Lord  
Veymouth takes his place. Lord Gower is  
made President of the Council in the room of  
Lord Northington, Lord Shelburne is stripped  
of the American business, which is given to  
Lord Hillsborough, as Secretary of State for  
America, a new, distinct department, Lord  
Sandwich, it is said, comes inte the Post Office  
in his place feveral of the bedford party are  
now to come in  
How these changes may affoct us a little time  
will show. Little at present is thought of but  
elections, which gives me hope that nothing  
will be done against America this session  
though the Boston tasefte has occasioned some  
heats and the Boston resolutions a prodigious  
clamor. I have endeavored to palliate matters  
for them as well as I can. I sond you my man  
of one paper, though I think you take  
uscript of one maper, thougn! think rot tane  
the Gionicle. The editor of that paper, one  
Jones, seems a Grenvillian, or is vary cautious  
as you will see, by his corrections and omis  
sions. He has drawn the teeth and pared the  
tle  
nails of my paper, so that it can neither seratch  
nall  
nor bite. It seems only to paw and mumble I  
  
send you also two other late pieces of mine  
here is another which I cannnt find  
I am told there has been a talk of getting me  
appointed under secretary to Lord. Hills  
borough, but with little likelihood, as it is a set­  
tled point here that I am too, much of an  
pont  
American. I am in very good health, thanks to  
God. Your affectionate father
