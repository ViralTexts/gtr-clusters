Needle Work.  
There is something extremely pleasant, and even touching—at least, of very sweet, soft, and winning effect—in this peculiarity of needle-work, distinguishing women from men. Our own sex is incapable of any such by-play aside from the main business of life; but women—be they of what earthly rank they may, however gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with awful beauty—have always some little handiwork ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant moment. A needle is familiar to the fingers of them all. A queen, no doubt, plies it on occasion; the woman-poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the woman&#x27;s eye, that has discovered a new star, turns from its glory to send the polished little instrument gleaming along the hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in her dress. And they have greatly the advantage of us in this respect. The slender thread of silk or cotton keeps them united with the small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the continually operating influences of which do so much for the health of the character, and carry off what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of morbid sensibility. A vast deal of human sympathy runs along this electric line, stretching from the throne to the wicker-chair of the humblest seamstress, and keeping high and low in a species of communion with their kindred beings. Methinks it is a token of healthy and gentle characteristics, when women of high thoughts and accomplishments love to sew; especially as they are never more at home with their own hearts than while so occupied.

Niii-LEWORK. There is something extremely

Our own sex is incapable of any such by-play,

be they of what earthly rank they may, how­  
ever gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed  
with awful beauty have always some little han  
diwork ready to till the tiny gap ot every tiny

new star, turns from its glory to send the polish  
ed little instrument gleaming along the hem of  
her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in her dress.  
And they have greatly tbe advantage of us in  
this respect. 1 he slender thread ot silk or cotton  
keeps them united with the small, familiar, gentle  
interests of life, the continually repeating influ  
ences of which do eo much for the health of the

familiar to the fingers of them all. A queen, no  
doubt, plies it on occasion ; the woman-poet can
