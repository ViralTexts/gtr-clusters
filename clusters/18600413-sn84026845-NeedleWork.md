Needle Work.  
There is something extremely pleasant, and even touching—at least, of very sweet, soft, and winning effect—in this peculiarity of needle-work, distinguishing women from men. Our own sex is incapable of any such by-play aside from the main business of life; but women—be they of what earthly rank they may, however gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with awful beauty—have always some little handiwork ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant moment. A needle is familiar to the fingers of them all. A queen, no doubt, plies it on occasion; the woman-poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the woman&#x27;s eye, that has discovered a new star, turns from its glory to send the polished little instrument gleaming along the hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in her dress. And they have greatly the advantage of us in this respect. The slender thread of silk or cotton keeps them united with the small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the continually operating influences of which do so much for the health of the character, and carry off what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of morbid sensibility. A vast deal of human sympathy runs along this electric line, stretching from the throne to the wicker-chair of the humblest seamstress, and keeping high and low in a species of communion with their kindred beings. Methinks it is a token of healthy and gentle characteristics, when women of high thoughts and accomplishments love to sew; especially as they are never more at home with their own hearts than while so occupied.

THE ADVANTAGES OF NEEDLEWORK FOR LADIES.  
  
Tus useful accomplishment has seldom been described  
in a manner to render it attractive. Music and Drawing  
are always ranked above the beautiful art of Needlework,  
because being so common its real influence on human  
happiness and the loveliness of feminine character have  
not been understood. There is, however, a charming  
passage in the prose poetry of the lamented Hawthorne,  
which we iavite our young readers to take to their hearts  
as a lesson for life; it will make them better and happier,  
if they heed its suggestions and practise its teachings,  
  
NEEDLEWORK.  
  
“There is something extremely pleasant and even  
touching—at least, of very sweet, soft, and winning  
effect—in this peculiarity of needlework, distinguishing  
women from men. Our own sex is incapable of any such  
by-play aside from the main business of life; but women

gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with awfel  
beauty—have always some little handiwork ready to fill  
the tiny gap of every vacant moment. A needle is familiar  
to the fingers of them all.  
  
“A queen, no doubt, plies a needle on occasion ; the  
Woman-poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the wo-  
man’s eye that has discovered some new star turns from  
its glory to send the polished little instrament gleaming  
slong the hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in  
her dress. And they have greatly the advantage of men  
in this respect. The slender thread of silk or cotton  
keeps them united with the small, familiar, gentle inte-  
rests of life, the continually operating influences of which  
do so much for the health of the character, and carry off  
what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of  
morbid sensibility. A vast deal of human sympathy  
runs along this electric line, stretching from the throne to

Women*« Charm of Needle-W&#x27;orK.  
There is something exquisitely pleasant and  
touching—at least of a very sweet, soit and  
winning effect—in this peculiarity of needle­  
work, distinguishing men from women. Our  
own sex is incapable of any such by-play  
aside troni the main business of life; but  
women—be they of what earthly rank they  
may, however gifted with intellect or genius,  
or endowed with urtful beauty—have always  
some little handiwork ready to till up the tiny  
gup of every vacant moment. A needle is  
familiar to the fingers of them all. A queen,  
no doubt, plies it on accusions; the woman­  
poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the  
woman&#x27;s eye that has discovered a new star  
turns from its glory to send the polished little  
instrument gleaming along the hem of her  
kerchief, or to darn a casual Haw in her dress.  
And they have the advantage of us in this  
respect. The slender thread of silk or cot­  
ton keeps them united with the small, famil­  
iar, gentle interests of life; the continually  
operating influences do much for the health  
of the character, and carry off what would  
otherwise bo a dangerous accumulation of  
morbid sensibility. A vast deal^ of human

good word to say of needlework :  
  
There is something extremely pleasant and even  
touching—at least of very, sweet, soft, and winning  
effect—in this peculiarity of needle-work, distin-  
guishing women from men. Our own sex is incapa-  
ble of any such by-play aside from the main business  
of life; but women—be they of what earthly rank  
they may, however gifted with intellect or genius, or  
endowed with awful beauty—have always some little  
handiwork ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant  
moment, A needle is familiar to the fingers of them  
all. A queen, no doubt, plies it on occasion; the  
woman poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the  
woman’s eye that has discovered a new star turns  
from its glory to send the polished little instrument  
gleaming along the hem of her kerchief, or to darna  
casual fray in her dress. And they have greatly the

There is something extremely pleasant and  
even touching at least of very sweet, soft and  
winning effect in this peculiarity of needle  
work, distinguishing women from men. Our  
own sex U incapable of any such by-play aside  
from the main business of lile; but women be  
they of what earthly rank they may, however  
gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with  
awful beauty have always some little handi­  
work ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant  
moment. A needle is familiar to the fingers of  
them all. A queen, no doubt, plies it on occa­

her pen ; the woman&#x27;s eye, that has discovered  
a new star, turns from its glory to send the  
polished little instrument gleaming along the  
hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in  
her dress. And they have greatly the advan­

of silk or cotton keeps them united with the  
small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the con­  
tinually operating influences of which do much

stretching from the throne to the wicker chair
