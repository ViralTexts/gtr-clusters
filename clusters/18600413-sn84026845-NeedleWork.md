Needle Work.  
There is something extremely pleasant, and even touching—at least, of very sweet, soft, and winning effect—in this peculiarity of needle-work, distinguishing women from men. Our own sex is incapable of any such by-play aside from the main business of life; but women—be they of what earthly rank they may, however gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with awful beauty—have always some little handiwork ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant moment. A needle is familiar to the fingers of them all. A queen, no doubt, plies it on occasion; the woman-poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the woman&#x27;s eye, that has discovered a new star, turns from its glory to send the polished little instrument gleaming along the hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in her dress. And they have greatly the advantage of us in this respect. The slender thread of silk or cotton keeps them united with the small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the continually operating influences of which do so much for the health of the character, and carry off what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of morbid sensibility. A vast deal of human sympathy runs along this electric line, stretching from the throne to the wicker-chair of the humblest seamstress, and keeping high and low in a species of communion with their kindred beings. Methinks it is a token of healthy and gentle characteristics, when women of high thoughts and accomplishments love to sew; especially as they are never more at home with their own hearts than while so occupied.

The NEEDLE AEd ITs WoNg.In  
the romance of &quot;Monte Bene&#x27; we find  
one of the best descriptions of this  
feminine accomplishment, needlework,  
that has ever been penned. We will  
give our readers the pleasure of its  
perusal, as many of them, probably,  
have never read Mr. Hawthorne&#x27;s  
work. He says:  
&quot;There is something extremely pleas-  
ant and even touching--at least of very  
aweet, soit, and winning effect--is this  
peculiarity of needle-work, distinguish­  
ing women from men. Our own sex  
  
is incapable of any by-play, aside from  
the main business of life, but women-  
be they of what earthly rank they may,  
however gifted with interior genius, or  
endowed with awful beaute--have al­  
ways some little handiwork ready to fill  
the tiny gap of every vacant moment  
A needle is familiar to the fingers of  
them all. A queen, no doubt, plies it  
on occasion; the woman-poet can use it  
as adroitly as her pen; the Woman&#x27;s  
eye that has discovered a new star turns  
from its glory to send the polished little  
instrument gleaming along the hem of  
her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in  
her dress. And they have greatly the  
advantage of us in this respect. The  
slender thread of silk or cotton keeps  
them united with the small, familliar,  
gentle interests of life, the continually  
operating influences of which do so  
much for the health of the character,  
and carry off what would otherwise be  
a dangerous accumulation of morbid  
sensibility. A vast deal of human  
sympathy runs slong this electric line,  
streching from the throne to the wicker­  
chair of the humane soamstress, and  
keeping high and low in a species of  
communion with their kindred beings.  
Methinks it is a token of healthy and  
gentle characteristics, when women of  
high thoughts and accomplishments  
love to sew, especially as they are never  
 more at home with their own hearts  
than while so occupied.&quot;

Needle-WorK.  
Needle-work is thus greatly eulogized  
by Nathaniel Hawthorne, in the &quot;Marble  
Faun;&quot;--&quot;There is something exquisi­  
tively pleasant and touching--at least of  
a very sweet, soft, and winning effect­  
in this peculiarity of needle-work, distin­  
guishing men from women. Our own  
sex is incapable of any such boy-play  
aside from the main business of life; but  
women--be they of what earthly rank  
they may, however gifted with intellect  
or genius, or endowed with artful beauty  
have always some little handiwork  
ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant  
moment. A needle is familiar to the  
fingers of them all. A queen, no doubt,  
plies it on occasion; the woman-poet can  
use it as adroitly as her pen; the wom­  
an&#x27;s eye that has discovered a new star  
turns from its glory to send the polished  
little instrument gleaming along the hem  
of her handkerchief, or to darn a casual  
flaw in her dress. And they have the  
advantage of us in this respect. The  
slender thread of cotton keeps them uni­  
ted with the small, familiar, gentle inter­  
ests of life, the continually operating in­  
fluences do much for the health of the  
character, and carry off what would oth­  
erwise be a dangerous accumulation of  
morbid sensibility. A vast deal of hu­  
man sympathy runs along this electric  
line, stretching from the throne of the  
wicker chair of the humble seamstress,  
and keeping high and low in a species of  
common union with their kindred beings.  
Methinks it is a token of healthy and  
gentle characteristics when women of  
accomplishments and high thoughts love  
to sew, especially as they are never more  
at home with their own hearts than when  
so occupied.&quot;

NeEDLE-Work.—From MHawthorne’s last work,  
“The Marble Faun,” we take the following paragraph  
concerning needle-work :  
  
There is something extremely pleasant, and even touching—  
at least of very sweet, soft, and winning effect—ia this pecul-  
iarity of needle-work, distinguishing men from women. Our  
own sex is incapable of any such by-play aside from the main

they may, however gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed

familiar to the fingers of them all. A queen, no doubt, plies  
it on occasions; the woman-poet can use it as adroitly as her  
pen; the woman&#x27;s eye that has discovered a new star, turns  
from its glory to send the polished little instrument gleaming  
along the hem of her kerchief, or to darp a casual fray in her  
dress. And they have the advantage of us in this respect.  
The slender thread of silk or cotton keeps them united with  
the small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the continually-  
operating influences of which do so much for the health of  
the character, and carry off what would otherwise be a  
dangerous accumulation of morbid sensibility. A vast deal  
of human sympathy runs along this electric line, stretching  
from the throne to the wicker-chair of the humblest seam-  
stress, and keeping high and lowa species of communion with  
their kindred beings. Methinks it is a token of healthy and  
gentle characteristics when women of accomplishments and  
high thoughts love to sew, especially as they are never more  
at home with their own hearts than when so occupied.

THE ADVANTAGES OF NEEDLEWORK FOR LADIES.  
  
Tus useful accomplishment has seldom been described  
in a manner to render it attractive. Music and Drawing  
are always ranked above the beautiful art of Needlework,  
because being so common its real influence on human  
happiness and the loveliness of feminine character have  
not been understood. There is, however, a charming  
passage in the prose poetry of the lamented Hawthorne,  
which we iavite our young readers to take to their hearts  
as a lesson for life; it will make them better and happier,  
if they heed its suggestions and practise its teachings,  
  
NEEDLEWORK.  
  
“There is something extremely pleasant and even  
touching—at least, of very sweet, soft, and winning  
effect—in this peculiarity of needlework, distinguishing  
women from men. Our own sex is incapable of any such  
by-play aside from the main business of life; but women  
—be they of whatever earthly rank they may, however  
gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with awfel  
beauty—have always some little handiwork ready to fill  
the tiny gap of every vacant moment. A needle is familiar  
to the fingers of them all.  
  
“A queen, no doubt, plies a needle on occasion ; the  
Woman-poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the wo-  
man’s eye that has discovered some new star turns from  
its glory to send the polished little instrament gleaming  
slong the hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in  
her dress. And they have greatly the advantage of men  
in this respect. The slender thread of silk or cotton  
keeps them united with the small, familiar, gentle inte-  
rests of life, the continually operating influences of which  
do so much for the health of the character, and carry off  
what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of  
morbid sensibility. A vast deal of human sympathy  
runs along this electric line, stretching from the throne to  
the wicker chair of the humblest seamstress, and keeping  
high and low ina species of communion with their kin-  
dred beings. Methinks it isa token of healthy and gentle  
cbaracteristies, when women of high thoughts and accom-  
plishments love to sew ; especially as they are never more  
at home with their own hearts than while so occupied.”

finery is no kindness ; but a stout dress,

well worth keeping in mind when we

Needle-Work.  
  
Needle-work is thus gracefully eulogized  
by Nathaniel Hawthorne, in the &quot;Marble  
Faun&quot;:—  
  
&quot;There is something exquisitely pleasant  
and touching—at least of a very sweet, soft  
and winning effect—in this peculiarity of  
needle-work, distinguishing men from wo­  
men. Our own sex is incapable of any  
such by-play aside from the main business  
of life; but women, be they of what  
earthly rank they may, however gifted  
with intellect or genius, or endowed  
with artful beauty—have always some  
little handiwork ready to fill up the tiny  
gap of every vacant moment. A needle  
is familiar to the fingers of them all. A  
queen, no doubt, plies It on occasions; the  
woman-poet can use it as adroitly as her  
pen ; the woman&#x27;s eye that has discovered a  
new star, turns from its glory to send the  
polished little instrument gleaming along  
the hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual  
flaw in her dress. And they have the ad­  
vantage of us in this respect. The slender  
thread of silk or cotton keeps them rniited  
with the small, familiar, gentle interests of  
life, the continually operating influences do  
much for the health of the character, and  
carry off what would otherwise be a dan­  
gerous accumulation of morbid sensibility.  
A vast deal of human sympathy runs along  
this electric line, stretching from the throne  
to the wicker chair of the humblest seam­  
stress, and keeping high and low in a species  
of common union with their kindred beings.  
Methinks it is a token of healthy and gentle  
characteristics when women of accomplish­  
ments and high thoughts love to sew,  
especially as they are never more at home  
with their own hearts than when so occupied.

There is something extremely pleasant and  
even touching at least of very sweet, soft and  
winning effect in this peculiarity of needle  
work, distinguishing women from men. Our  
own sex U incapable of any such by-play aside  
from the main business of lile; but women be  
they of what earthly rank they may, however  
gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with  
awful beauty have always some little handi­  
work ready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant  
moment. A needle is familiar to the fingers of  
them all. A queen, no doubt, plies it on occa­  
sion; the woman poet can use it as adroitly as  
her pen ; the woman&#x27;s eye, that has discovered  
a new star, turns from its glory to send the  
polished little instrument gleaming along the  
hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual fray in  
her dress. And they have greatly the advan­  
tage of us in this respect. The slender thread  
of silk or cotton keeps them united with the  
small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the con­  
tinually operating influences of which do much  
for the health of tho character and carry off  
what would otherwise be a dangerous accumu­  
lation of morbid sensibility. A vast deal of  
human sympathy runs along this elective line,  
stretching from the throne to the wicker chair  
of the humblest seamstress, and seeping high  
and low in a species of communion wiu their  
kindred teings. Methinks it is a token of  
healthy and gentle characteristics when women  
of high thoughts and accomplishments live to  
sew; especially as they are never more at  
home with tbeir own hearts than while so oc
