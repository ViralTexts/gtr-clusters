My dear old Friend,  
Paris, Feb. 28. 1778.  
Don’t be offended at the Word old; I don’t mean to call you an old Woman; it relates only to the age of our Friendship; which on my part has always been a sincerely affectionate one, and I flatter myself the same on yours.  
I receivd your kind Letter from Boston of Oct. 28. which gave me great Pleasure, as it inform’d me of the Welfare of you and your Family. I continue hearty, as do my two Grandsons, who present their Respects to you and Mr. Greene, being pleas’d with your Remembrance of them. We are all glad to hear of Ray, for we all love him. I have been often much concern’d for my Friends at Warwick, hearing that the Enemy was so near them. I hope your Troubles will not be of much longer Duration; For tho’ the Wickedness of the English Court, and its Malice against us is as great as ever, its Horns are shortned; its Strength diminishes daily; and we have form’d an Alliance here, and shall form others, that will help to keep the Bull quiet, and make him orderly. I chat, you see, as usual, anyhow, with you, who are kind enough never to criticize Improprieties in my Comparisons or anything else. I see by yours that my Sister’s Grandaughter is married. I wish the young Folks Joy and Lasting Happiness. I pity my poor old Sister, to be so harass’d and driven about by the Enemy. For I feel a little myself the Inconvenience of being driven about by my Friends. I live here in great Respect, and dine every day with great Folks; but I still long for home and for Repose; and should be happy to eat Indian Pudding in your Company and under your hospitable Roof. Remember

| ‘To Governor G*****,.—My pear orp Frienp,—  
Don’t be offended at the word old ; I don’t mean to  
eall you an old woman ; it relates only to the age of  
  
  
  
our friendship, which on my part has always been  
a sincerely affectionate one, and I flatter myself the

Boston, of Oct. 28th. It gave me great pleasure, as  
‘it informed me of the welfare of you and your  
family. I continue hearty, as do my two grand-  
sous, Who present their respects to you and Mrs.  
G., being pleased with your remembrance of them.  
We are all glad to hear of Ray, for we all love  
him. I have often been concerned for the safety  
of my friends at Warwick, hearing that the enemy  
were so near them. I hope your troubles will not  
be of much longer duration, fur though the wick-  
jedness of the English court and their malice  
against us is as great as ever, its hours are short-  
ened, its strength diminished daily, and we have  
formed an alliance here, and shall form others, that  
will help to keep the Bull quiet, and make him  
orderly. I chat, you see, as usual, any how with  
you, who are kind enough never to criticize any  
improprieties in my comparisons, or anything else.  
I see by yours that my sister’s grand-daughter is  
married ; I wish the young folks joy and lasting  
happiness. 1 pity my poor old sister to be so har-  
assed and driven about by the enemy, for I feel a  
little myself the inconvenience of being driven

and dine every day with great folks, but I still  
long for home and repose, and should be happy to  
eat Indian pudding in your company and under

“My dear old friend: don’t be offended at the  
word old. I don’t mean to call you an old wo-  
man; it relates only to the age of our friendship.”  
And then he goes on to tell her that he hopes the  
war is nearly over; “for though the wickedness  
of the English court and its malice against us are  
as great as ever, its horns are shortened, its strength  
diminishes daily, and we have formed an alliance  
here (in France), and shall form others that will  
help to keep the bull quiet and make him orderly.”
