cts, I learnt from one of your Sex, who, as Selden tells us, being in company with some Gentlemen that were viewing and considering something which they call’d a Chinese Shoe, and disputing earnestly about the manner of wearing it, and how it could possibly be put on; put in her Word, and said modestly, Gentlemen, are you sure it is a Shoe? Should not that be settled first?

n the Water would be equal to the Hills.  
That this is not mere Theory, but conformable to Fact, we know by our long Rivers in America. The Delaware, on which Philadelphia stands, is in this particular similar to the Canal I have supposed of one Wave: For when it is High Water at the Capes or Mouth of the River, it is also High Water at Philadelphia, which stands about 140 Miles from the Sea; and there is at the same time a Low Water in the Middle between the two High Waters; where, when it comes to be High Water, it is at the same time Low Water at the Capes and at Philadelphia. And the longer Rivers have, some a Wave and Half, some two, three, or four Waves, according to their Length. In the shorter Rivers of this Island, one may see the same thing in Part: for Instance; it is High Water at Gravesend an Hour before it is High Water at London Bridge; and 20 Miles below Gravesend an Hour before it is High Water at Gravesend. Therefore

nto a Pond of Water when the Surface is still and smooth, you will see a circular Wave proceed from the Stone as its Center, quite to the Sides of the Pond; but the Water does not proceed with the Wave, it only rises and falls to form it in the different Parts of its Course; and the Waves that follow the first, all make use of the same Water with their Predecessors.  
But a Wave in Water is not indeed in all

that the whole body of water runs at the rate the wave does ; for if you thiow a  
fone into a pond when the furface 1s {mooth, you will fee a wave proceed from  
the flone to the {nie of the pond; but the water does net proceed wih the wave ;  
it only rifes ond falls to form i inthe diff-rent parts of its courle ; and the waves  
that follow the firft, make ufe of the fame water with their precuifors. Each of  
thefe waves is a tide, in miniature. Tiat this is conformable to fa&amp;, we know by  
our long rivers in America. In the Delaware, on which Philadelphia funds, for  
example, it is high water at the capes or mouth of the river, when it is high wa-  
ter at that city, which lies about 140 miles trom the fea ; and there is at the  
fame time a low water in the mitdle between thefe two high waters ; where,  
when it comes to be high water, it is at the fame time low water at the capes  
and Philadelphia*—and longer rivers have fome a wave and a half, fome two,  
three, or four waves, or tides, according to their length ; theretore there is little  
or no difference in the quantity of water in a river, whether the tide is ebb or  
full. The tide or wave runs twenty miles, and fometimes more, per hour ; as  
we fee in the Thames, where it is high water at Loncon Bridge an hour after it  
is high water at Gravefend, which 1s twenty miles below it; and then it is near-  
hy low water at the mouth of the river.
