: I made no Return of the Injury by abusing my Adversaries; but held a cool sullen Silence, reserving my self to some future Opportunity; for which Conduct I had several Reasons not necessary here to specify. Now and then I heard it said, that the reasonable Part of the Administration were asham’d of the Treatment they had given me. I suspected that some who told me this, did it to draw from me my Sentiments concerning it, and perhaps my Purposes: But I said little or nothing upon the Subject. In the mean time their Measures with regard to New England failing of the Success that had been confidently expected, and finding themselves more and more embarrass’d, they began, (as it seems) to think of making use of me, if they could, to assist in disengaging them. But it was too humiliating to think of applying to me openly and directly; and therefore it was contriv’d to obtain what they could of my Sentiments thro’ others.  
The Accounts from America during the Recess, all manifested that the Measures of Administration had neither divided nor intimidated the People there; that on the contrary they were more and more united and determined, and that a Nonimportation Agreement was likely to take place. The Ministry thence Apprehending, that this, by distressing the trading and manufacturing Towns, might influence votes against the Court in the Elections for a new Parliament, which were in course to come on the succeeding Year, suddenly and unexpectedly dissolv’d the old one, and ordered the Choice of a new o

.  
When I came to England in 1757, you may remember I made several Attempts to be introduc’d to Lord Chatham, (at that time first Minister) on Account of my Pensilvania Business, but without Success. He was then too great a Man, or too much occupy’d in Affairs of greater Moment. I was therefore oblig’d to content my self with a kind of non-apparent and un-acknowledg’d Communication thro’ Mr. Potter and Mr. Wood his Secretaries, who seem’d to cultivate an Acquaintance with me by their Civilities, and drew from me what Information I could give relative to the American War, with my Sentiments occasionally on Measures that were proposed or advised by others. I afterwards considered Mr. Pitt as an Inaccessible: I admired him at a distance, and made no more Attempts for a nearer Acquaintance. I had only once or twice the Satisfaction of hearing thro’ Lord Shelburne and I think Lord Stanhope that he did me the honour of mentioning me sometimes as a Person of respectable Character.  
But towards the End of August last, returning from Brighthelmstone, I called to visit my Friend Mr. Sargent at his Seat, Halsted, in Kent, agreable to a former Engagement. He let me know, that he had promised to conduct me to Lord Stanhope’s at Chevening, who expected I would call on him when I came into that Neighbourhood. We accordingly waited on Lord Stanhope that Evening, who told me Lord Chatham desired to see me; and that Mr. Sargent’s House where I was to lodge, being in the way, he would call for me there the next Morning and carry me to Hayes. This was done accordingly. That truly great Man Lord Chatham receiv’d me with abundance of Civility, enquired particularly into the Situation of Affairs in America, spoke feelingly of the Severity of the late Laws against the Massachusetts, gave me some Account of his Speech in Opposing them and express’d great Regard and Esteem for the People of that Country, who he hop’d would continue firm and united in defending by all peaceable and legal Means their constitutional Rights. I assur’d him that I made no doubt they would do so; which he said he was pleas’d to hear from me, as he was sensible I must be well acquainted with them. I then took occasion to remark to him, that in former Cases great Empires had crumbled first at their Extremities from this Cause, that Countries remote from the Seat and Eye of Government which therefore could not well understand their Affairs for want of full and true Information, had never been well governed, but had been oppress’d by bad Governors, on Presumption that Complaint was difficult to be made and supported against them at such a Distance. Hence such Govrs. had been encouraged to go on, till their Oppressions became intolerable. But that this Empire had happily found and long been in the Practice of a Method, whereby every Province was well governed, being trusted in a great Measure with the Government of itself, and that hence had arisen such Satisfaction in the Subjects, and such Encouragement to new Settlements, that had it not been for the late wrong politicks, (which would have Parliament to be omnipotent, tho’ it ought not to be so unless it could at the same time be omniscient) we might have gone on extending our Western Empire adding Province to Province as far as the South Sea. That I lamented the Ruin which seemed impending over so fine a Plan, so well adapted to make all the Subjects of the greatest Empire happy; and I hoped that if his Lordship with the other great and wise Men of this Nation would unite and exert themselves; it might yet be rescu’d out of the mangling Hands of the present Set of Blundering Ministers, and that the Union and Harmony between Britain and her Colonies so necessary to the Welfare of both might be restored. He replied with great Politeness, that my Idea of extending our Empire in that Manner, was a sound one, and worthy of a great, benevolent and comprehensive Mind. He

Understanding among the different Parts of the Opposition here, as a Means of restoring the ancient Harmony of the two Countries, which he most earnestly desir’d; but he spoke of the Coalition of our domestick Parties as attended with Difficulty, and rather to be desired than expected.  
He mention’d an Opinion prevailing here that America aim’d at setting up for itself as an independent State; or at least to get rid of the Navigation Acts. I assur’d him, that having more than once travelled almost from one end of the Continent to the other and kept a great Variety of Company, eating drinking and conversing with them freely, I never had heard in any Conversation from any Person drunk or sober, the least Expession of a Wish for a Separation, or Hint that such a Thing would be advantageous to America.

 being very sensible of the Honour, and of the great Advantage and Improvement I should reap from his instructive Conversation, which indeed was not a meer Compliment.  
  
The new Parliament was to meet the 29th of November. About the Beginning of that Month, being at the Royal Society, Mr. Raper one of our Members told me there was a certain Lady who had a Desire of Playing with me at Chess, fancying she could beat me, and had requested him to bring me to her: it was, he said, a Lady with whose Acquaintance he was sure I should be pleas’d, a Sister of Lord Howe’s, and he hop’d I would not refuse the Challenge. I said I had been long out of Practice, but would wait upon the Lady when he and she should think fit. He told me where her House was, and would have me call soon and without farther Introduction, which I undertook to do; but thinking it a little awkward, I postpon’d it; and on the 30th meeting him again at the Feast of the Society Election, being the Day after the Parliament met, he put me in Mind of my Promise, and that I had not kept it, and would have me name a Day when he said he would call for me and conduct me. I nam’d the Friday following. He call’d accordingly. I went with him, play’d a few Games with the Lady, whom I found of very sensible Conversation and pleasing Behaviour, which induc’d me to agree most readily to an Appointment for another Meeting a few Days after, tho’ I had not the least Apprehension that any political Business could have any Connection with this new Acquaintance.  
On the Thursday preceding this Chess Party, Mr. David Barclay call’d on me to have some Discourse concerning the Meeting of Merchants to petition Parliament. When that was over, he spoke of the dangerous Situation of American Affairs, the Hazard that a Civil War might be bro’t on by the present Measures, and the great Merit that Person would have, who could contrive some Means of preventing so terrible a Calamity, and bring about a Reconciliation. He was then pleas’d to add, that he was persuaded, from my Knowledge of both Countries, my Character and Influence in one of them, and my Abilities in Business, no Man had it so much in his Power as myself. I naturally answer’d, that I should certainly be very happy if I could in any degree be instrumental in so good a Work; but that I saw no Prospect of it: For that tho’ I was sure the Americans were always willing and ready to agree upon any equitable Terms, yet I thought an Accommodation impracticable unless both sides wish’d it, and by what I could judge from the Proceedings of the Ministry, I did not believe they had the least Disposition towards it; that they rather wish’d to provoke the N E. People into an open Rebellion, which might justify a military Execution, and thereby gratify a grounded Malice which I conceived to exist here against the Whigs and Dissenters of that Country. Mr. Barclay apprehended I judg’d too hardly of the Ministers; he was persuaded they were not all of that Temper, and he fancy’d they would be very glad to get out of their present Embarrasment on any Terms, only saving the Honour and Dignity of Government. He wish’d therefore that I would think of the Matter, and he would call again and converse with me farther upon it. I said I would do so, as he requested it, but I had no Opinion of its answering any Purpose. We parted upon this. But two Days after I receiv’d a Letter from him, inclos’d in a Note from Dr. Fothergill, both which follow.  
  
Here insert the Letters of Dec. 3. No. 1, 2.  
  
The Time thus appointed was the Evening of the Day on which I was to have my second Chess Party with the agreable Mrs. Howe, whom I met accordingly. After Playing as long as we lik’d, we fell into a little Chat, partly on a Mathematical Problem, and partly about the new Parliament then just met, when she said, “And what is to be done with this Dispute between Britain and the Colonies? I hope we are not to have a Civil War. They should kiss and [be] Friends, says I, what can they do better? Quarrelling can be of Service to neither but is Ruin to both. I have often said, says she, that I wish’d Government would employ you to settle the Dispute for ’em. I am sure no body could do it so well. Don’t you think that the thing is practicable? Undoubtedly, Madam, if the Parties are dispos’d to Reconciliation; for the two Countries have really no clashing Interest to differ about. It is rather a Matter of Punctilio, which Two or three reasonable People might settle in half an Hour. I thank you for the good Opinion you are pleas’d to express of me: But the Ministers will never think of employing me in that good Work, they chuse rather to abuse me. Ay, says She, they have behav’d shamefully to you. And indeed some of them are now asham’d of it themselves.” I look’d upon this as accidental Conversation, thought no more of it, and went in the Evening to the appointed Meeting at Dr. Fothergill’s, where I found Mr. Barclay with him.

And that I might rely on his keeping perfectly secret every thing I should wish to remain so.

I had promised Lord Chatham to communicate to him the first important News I should receive from America. I therefore sent him the Proceedings of the Congress as soon as I receiv’d them. But a whole Week pass’d after I receiv’d the Petition before I could, as I wish’d to do, wait upon him with it, in order to obtain his Sentiments on the whole; for my time was taken up in Meetings with the other Agents to consult about presenting the Petition, in waiting three different Days with them on Lord Dartmouth, in consulting upon and Writing Letters to the Speakers of Assemblies, and other Business which did not allow me a Day to go to Hayes. At last on Monday the 26th, I got out, and was there about One a Clock. He receiv’d me with an affectionate kind of Respect that from so great a Man was extreamly engaging. But the Opinion he express’d of the Congress was still more so. They had acted, he said with so much Temper, Moderation and Wisdom, that he thought it the most honourable Assembly of Statesmen since those of the ancient Greeks and Romans in the most virtuous Times. That there were not in their whole Proceedings above one or two things he could have wish’d otherwise, perhaps but one, and that was, their Assertion, that the keeping up a standing Army in the Colonies in time of Peace without Consent of their Legislatures was against Law; he doubted that was not well founded: and that the Law alluded to did not extend to the Colonies. The rest he admir’d and honour’d. He thought the Petition decent, manly, and properly express’d. He enquired much and particularly concerning the State of America, the Probability of their Perseverance, the Difficulty’s they must meet with in Adhering for any long time to their Resolutions, the Resources they might have to supply the Deficiency of Commerce; to all which I gave him Answers with which he seem’d well satisfy’d. He express’d a great Regard and warm Affection for that Country, with hearty Wishes for their Prosperity; and that Government here might soon come to see its Mistakes and rectify them, and intimated that possibly he might, if his Health permitted prepare something for its Consideration, when the Parliament should meet after the Holidays, on which he should wish to have previously my Sentiments.

From Hayes I went to Halsted, Mr. Sargent’s, to dine, intending thence a Visit to Lord Stanhope at Chevening; but hearing there that his Lordship and the Family were in town, I staid at Halsted all Night, and the next Morning went to Chislehurst to call upon Lord Camden, it being in my way to Town. I met his Lordship and Family in two Carriages just without his Gate going on a Visit of Congratulation to Lord Chatham and his Lady on the late Marriage of their Daughter to Lord Mahon, Son of Lord Stanhope. They were to be back at Dinner. So I agreed to go in, stay Dinner, and spend the Evening there, and not return to Town till next Morning. We had that Afternoon and Evening a great deal of Conversation on American Affairs, concerning which he was very inquisitive, and I gave him the best Information in my Power. I was charm’d with his generous and noble Sentiments; and had the great Pleasure of hearing his full Approbation of the Proceedings of the Congress, the Petition, &amp;c. of which, at his Request I afterwards sent him a Copy. He seem’d anxious that the Americans should continue to act with the same Temper, Coolness and Wisdom, with which they had hitherto proceeded in most of their publick Assemblies, in which case he did not doubt they would succeed in establishing their Rights, and obtain a solid and durable Agreement with the Mother Country, of the Necessity and great Importance of which Agreement, he seemed to have the strongest Impressions.

 in owning to him that I had been consulted on the Subject, and had drawn up that Paper. He said he was rather sorry to find that the Sentiments express’d in it were mine, as it gave him less hopes of promoting by my Assistance the wish’d-for Reconciliation, since he had reason to think there was no likelyhood of the Admission of those Propositions. He hop’d however that I would re-consider the Subject, and form some Plan that would be acceptable here. He expatiated on the infinite Service it would be to the Nation, and the great Merit of being instrumental in so good a Work; that he should not think of influencing me by any selfish Motive, but certainly I might with reason expect any Reward in the Power of Government to bestow. This to me was what the French call Spitting in the Soup. However I promis’d to draw some Sketch of a Plan at his Request, tho’ I much doubted, I said, whether it would be thought preferable to that he had in his Hand. But he was willing to hope that it would, and as he consider’d my Situation; that I had Friends here and Constituents in America to keep well with; that I might possibly propose something improper to be seen in my Handwriting; therefore it would be best to send it to Mrs. Howe, who would copy it send the Copy to him to be communicated to the Ministry, and return me the Original. This I agreed to tho’ I did not apprehend the Inconvenience he mention’d. In general I lik’d much his Manner, and found my self dispos’d to place great Confidence in him on Occasion,

On the 19th of Jany. I receiv’d a Card from Lord Stanhope, acquainting me, that Lord Chatham having a Motion to make on the Morrow in the House of Lords concerning America, greatly desired that I might be in the House, into which Lord S. would endeavour to procure me Admittance. At this time it was a Rule of the House that no Peer could introduce more than one Friend. The next Morning, his Lordship let me know by another Card, that if I attended at two o’Clock in the Lobby, Lord Chatham would be there about that time, and would himself introduce me. I attended and met him there accordingly. On my mentioning to him what Lord Stanhope had written to me, he said, Certainly, and I shall do it with the more Pleasure as I am sure your being present at this Days Debate will be of more Service to America than mine; and so taking me by the Arm was leading me along the Passage to the Door that enters near the Throne, when one of the Doorkeepers followed, and acquainted him, that by the Order, none were to be carried in at that Door but the eldest Sons or Brothers of Peers; on which he limped back with me to the Door near the Bar, where were standing a Number of Gentlemen waiting for the Peers who were to introduce them, and some Peers waiting for Friends they expected to introduce, among whom he deliver’d me to the Doorkeepers, saying aloud, this is Dr. Franklin, whom I would have admitted into the House; when they readily open’d the Door for me accordingly. As it had not been publickly known that there was any Communication between his Lordship and me, this I found occasion’d some Speculation. His Appearance in the House I observ’d caus’d a kind of Bustle among the Officers, who were hurried in sending Messengers for Members, I suppose those in Connection with the Ministry, something of Importance being expected when that great Man appears, it being but seldom that his Infirmities permit his Attendance. I had great Satisfaction in hearing his Motion and the Debate upon it, which I shall not attempt to give here an Account of, as you may find a better in the Papers of the time. It was his Motion for withdrawing the Troops from Boston, as the first Step towards an Accommodation. The Day following, I receiv’d a Note from Lord Stanhope expressing, that …  I sent Copies of this Motion to America, and was the more pleased with it, as I conceiv’d it had partly taken its Rise from a Hint I had given his Lordship in a former Conversation.  
The Motion was in these Words, viz.  
  
(Here insert it) Leave a blank of half a Page for this. [In the margin:] No 10  
Lord Chatham’s Motion, Jan. 20. 1775.  
  
“That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty, most humbly to advise and beseech his Majesty, that, in order to open the Way towards an happy Settlement of the dangerous Troubles in America, by beginning to allay Ferments and soften Animosities there; and above all, for preventing in the mean time any sudden and fatal Catastrophe at Boston, now suffering under the daily Irritation of an Army before their Eyes, posted in their Town, it may graciously please his Majesty that immediate Orders may be dispatched to General Gage for removing his Majesty’s Forces from the Town of Boston, as soon as the Rigour of the Season and other Circumstances indispensable to the Safety and Accommodation of the said Troops may render the same practicable.”  
I was quite charm’d with Lord Chatham’s Speech in Support of his Motion. He impress’d me with the highest Idea of him as a great and most able Statesman. Lord Camden, another wonderfully good Speaker and clear close Reasoner, join’d him in the same Argument, as did several other Lords who spoke excellently well; but all avail’d no more than the whistling of the Winds. The Motion was rejected. Sixteen Scotch Peers, and twenty four Bishops, with all the Lords in Possession or Expectation of Places when they vote together unanimously as they generally do for Ministerial Measures, make a dead Majority that renders all Debating ridiculous in itself, since it can answer no End. Full of the high Esteem I had imbib’d for Lord Chatham, I wrote back to Lord Stanhope the following Note, viz.  
  
(Here insert it). [In the margin:] No 10  
  
As in the Course of the Debate, some Lords in the Administration had observed, that it was common and easy to censure their Measures, but those who did so propos’d nothing better, Lord Chatham mention’d that he should not be one of those, idle Censurers, that he had thought long and closely upon the Subject, and purposed soon to lay before their Lordships the Result of his Meditations in a Plan for healing our Differences, and restoring Peace to the Empire, to which his present Motion was preparatory: I much desir’d to know what his Plan was, and intended waiting on him to see if he would communicate it to me; but he went the next Morning to Hayes, and I was so much taken up with Daily Business and Company that I could not easily get out to him. A few Days after, however, Lord Mahon call’d on me, and told me Lord Chatham was very desirous of seeing me; when I promis’d to be with him the Friday following several Engagements preventing my going sooner. On Friday the 27th, I took a Post Chaise about 9 aClock and got to Hayes about 11 but my Attention being engag’d in Reading a new Pamphlet, the Postboy drove me a Mile or two beyond the Gate. His Lordship being out on an Airing in his Chariot, had met me before I reach’d Hayes unobserv’d by me, turn’d and follow’d me, and not finding me there, concluded, as he had seen me reading, that I had pass’d by Mistake, and sent a Servant after me.

, he concluded to offer it the Wednesday following; and therefore wish’d to see me upon it the preceding Tuesday, when he would again call upon me unless I could conveniently come to Hayes. I chose the latter in respect to his Lordship, and because there was less likelihood of Interruptions: and I promis’d to be with him early, that we might have more time. He staid with me near two Hours, his Equipage waiting at the Door, and being there while People were coming from Church it was much taken notice of and talk’d of, as at that time was every little Circumstance that Men thought might possibly any way affect American Affairs. Such a Visit from so great a Man, on so important a Business, flattered not a little my Vanity; and the Honour of it gave me the more Pleasure, as it happen’d on the very Day 12 month, that the Ministry had taken so much pains to disgrace me before the Privy Council.  
I apply’d myself immediately to the reading and considering the Plan, of which when it was afterwards publish’d I sent you a Copy, and therefore need not insert it here.

 Supposing I had a considerable Share in Composing it, I assure you, that the Addition of a single Word only was made at my Instance, viz. “Constitutions” after “Charters;” for my filling up at his Request a Blank with the Titles of Acts proper to be repeal’d, which I took from the Proceedings of the Congress, was no more than might have been done by any Copying Clerk.  
  
On Wednesday Lord Stanhope at Lord Chatham’s Request call’d upon me and carry’d me down to the House of Lords, which was soon very full. Lord Chatham in a most excellent Speech, introduc’d, explain’d and supported his Plan. When he sat down, Lord Dartmouth rose, and very properly said, it contain’d Matter of such Weight and Magnitude, as to require much Consideration, and he therefore hoped the noble Earl did not expect their Lordships to decide upon it by an immediate Vote, but would be willing it should lie upon the Table for Consideration. Lord Chatham answer’d readily that he expected nothing more. But Lord Sandwich rose, and in a petulant vehement Speech oppos’d its being receiv’d at all, and gave his Opinion that it ought to be immediately REJECTED with the Contempt it deserv’d. That he could never believe it the Production of any British Peer. That it appear’d to him rather the Work of some American; and turning his Face towards me, who was leaning on the Bar, said, he fancied he had in his Eye the Person who drew it up, one of the bitterest and most mischievous Enemies this Country had ever known. This drew the Eyes of many Lords upon me: but as I had no Inducement to take it to myself, I kept my Countenance as immoveable as if my Features had been made of Wood. Then several other Lords of the Administration gave their Sentiments

n, being with Dispositions for the best Measures, easily prevail’d with to join in the worst. Lord Chatham, in his Reply to Lord Sandwich, took notice of his illiberal Insinuation that the Plan was not the Person’s who propos’d it: declar’d that it was intirely his own, a Declaration he thought himself the more oblig’d to make, as many of their Lordps. appear’d to have so mean an Opinion of it; for if it was so weak or so bad a Thing, it was proper in him to take care that no other Person should unjustly share in the Censure it deserved. That it had been heretofore reckon’d his Vice not to be apt to take Advice. But he made no Scruple to declare, that if he were the first Minister of this Country, and had the Care of Settling this momentous Business, he should not be asham’d of publickly calling to his Assistance a Person so perfectly acquainted with the whole of American Affairs, as the Gentleman alluded to and injuriously reflected on, one, he was pleas’d to say, whom all Europe held in high Estimation for his Knowledge and Wisdom, and rank’d with our Boyles and Newtons; who was an Honour not to the English Nation only but to Human Nature. I found it harder to stand this extravagant Compliment than the preceding equally extravagant Abuse, but kept as well as I could an unconcern’d Countenance, as not conceiving it to relate to me.  
To hear so many of these Hereditary Legislators declaiming so vehemently against, not the Adopting merely, but even the Consideration of a Proposal so important in its Nature, offered by a Person of so weighty a Character, one of the first Statesman of the Age, who had taken up this Country when in the lowest Despondency, and conducted it to Victory and Glory thro’ a War with two of the mightiest Kingdoms in Europe; to hear them censuring his Plan not only for their own Misunderstandings  of what was in it, but for their Imaginations of what was not in it, which they would not give themselves an Opportunity of rectifying by a second Reading; to perceive the total Ignorance of the Subject in some, the Prejudice and Passion of others, and the wilful Perversion of Plain Truth in several of the Ministers; and upon the whole to see it so ignominiously rejected by so great a Majority, and so hastily too, in Breach of all Decency and prudent Regard to the Character and Dignity of their Body as a third Part of the National Legislature, gave me an exceeding mean Opinion of their Abilities, and made their Claim of Sovereignty over three Millions of virtuous sensible People in America, seem the greatest of Absurdities, since they appear’d to have scarce Discretion enough to govern a Herd of Swine. Hereditary Legislators! thought I. There would be more Propriety, because less Hazard of Mischief, in having [(as] in some University of Germany,) Hereditary Professors of Mathematicks! But this was a hasty Reflection: For the elected House of Commons is no better, nor ever will be while the Electors receive Money for their Votes, and pay Money where with Ministers may bribe their Representatives when chosen.

y imagined more to be in my Power than really was; I was then told again that Conferences had been held upon the Hints; and the Paper being produced was read; that I might hear the Observations that had been made upon them separately, which were as follows. …   
We had not at this Time a great deal of Conversation upon these Points, for I shortned it by observing, that while the Parliament claim’d and exercis’d a Power of altering our Constitutions at pleasure, there could be no Agreement; for we were render’d unsafe in every Privilege we had a Right to, and were secure in nothing. And it being hinted how necessary an Agreement was for America, since it was so easy for Britain to burn all our Sea Port Towns, I grew warm, said that the chief Part of my little Property consisted of Houses in those Towns; that they might make Bonfires of them whenever they pleased; that the Fear of losing them would never alter my Resolution to resist to the last that Claim of Parliament; and that it behov’d this Country to take Care what Mischief it did us, for that sooner or later it would certainly be obliged to make good all Damages with Interest.

He let me know that he was thought of to be sent Commissioner; for settling the Differences in America; adding with an Excess of Politeness; that sensible of his own Unacquaintedness with the Business, and of my Knowledge and Abilities, he could not think of undertaking it without me, but with me he should do it most readily; for he should found his Expectations of Success on my Assistance; he therefore had desired this Meeting to know my Mind upon a Proposition of my going with him in one Shape or other, as a Friend, an Assistant or Secretary: That he was very sensible if he [should be so happy] as to effect any thing valuable [it] must be wholly owing to the Advice and Assistance [I should afford] him; that he should therefore [make no Scruple] of giving me upon all Occasions the full honour of it; that he had [declar’d to the Ministers] his Opinion of my good Dispositions towards Peace; and what he now wish’d was to be authoriz’d by me to say, that I consented to accompany him, and would co-operate with him in the great Work of Reconciliation. That the Influence I had over the Minds of People in America was known to be very extensive; and that I could, if any man could, prevail with them to comply with reasonable Propositions. I reply’d that I was oblig’d to his Lordship for the favourable Opinion he had of me, and for the Honour he did me in proposing to make Use of my Assistance; that I wish’d to know what Propositions were intended for America; that if they were reasonable ones in themselves, possibly I might be able to make them appear such to my Countrymen; but if they were otherwise, I doubted whether that could be done by any Man and certainly I should not undertake it. His Lordship then said, that he should not expect my Assistance without a proper Consideration. That the Business was of great Importance, and if he undertook it, he should insist on being enabled to make generous and ample Appointments for those he took with him, particularly for me; as well as a firm Promise of subsequent Rewards; and, says he, that the Ministry may have an Opportunity of showing their good Disposition towards yourself, will you give me leave, Mr. Franklin, to procure for you previously some Mark of it, suppose the Payment here of the Arrears of your Salary as Agent for New England, which I understand they have stopt for some time past? My Lord, says I, I shall deem it a great Honour to be in any shape join’d with your Lordship in so good a Work; but if you hope Service from any Influence I may be suppos’d to have, drop all Thoughts of procuring me any previous Favour from Ministers; my accepting them, would destroy the very Influence you propose to make use of; they would be considered as so many Bribes to betray the Interest of my Country: Only let me see the Propositions, and if I approve of them, I shall not hesitate a Moment, but will hold my self ready to accompany your Lordship at an hours Warning.

The House was accordingly very full, and the Members full of Expectation. The Bedford Party inimical to America, and who had urg’d severe Measures, were alarm’d, and began to exclaim against the Minister for his Timidity, and the Fluctuation of his Politicks; they even began to count Voices, to see if they could not by negativing his Motion, at once unhorse him, and throw him out of Administration.

Lord North’s Motion, Feb. 20. 1775.  
“That it is the Opinion of this Committee, that when the Governor Council and Assembly or General Court of his Majesty’s Provinces or Colonies, shall propose to make Provision according to their respective Conditions, Circumstances and situations, for contributing their Proportion to the common Defence, such Proportion to be raised under the Authority of the General Court, or General Assembly of such Province or Colony, and disposable by Parliament; and shall engage to make Provision also for the Support of the Civil Government, and the Administration of Justice in such Province or Colony; it will be proper, if such Proposal shall be approved by his Majesty in Parliament, and for so long as such Provision shall be made accordingly, to forbear in respect of such Province or Colony, to levy any Duties, Tax or Assessment, or to impose any further Duty, Tax or Assessment, except only such Duties as it may be expedient to impose for the Regulation of Commerce; the nett Produce of the Duties last mentioned, to be carried to the Account of such Province, Colony or Plantation respectively.”

He began by saying, that I had been a better Prophet than himself, in foreseeing that my Interview with Lord Hyde would be of no great Use: and then said, that he hoped I would excuse the Trouble he had given me, as his Intentions had been good both towards me and the Publick; he was sorry that at present there was no Appearance of Things going into the Train he had wished; but that possibly they might yet take a more favourable Turn; and as he understood I was going soon to America, if he should chance to be sent thither on that important Business, he hop’d he might still expect my Assistance.

f Memory; but what there is, I believe to be pretty exact; except that discoursing with so many different Persons about the same time on the same Subject, I may possibly have put down some things as said by or to one Person, which pass’d in Conversation with another.  
A little before I left London, being at the House of Lords, to hear a Debate in which Lord Camden was to speak, and who indeed spoke admirably on American Affairs, I was much disgusted from the ministerial Side, by many base Reflections on American Courage, Religion, Understanding, &amp;c. in which we were treated with the utmost Contempt, as the lowest of Mankind, and almost of a different Species from the English of Britain; but particularly the American Honesty was abused by some of the Lords, who asserted that we were all Knaves, and wanted only by this Dispute to avoid paying our Debts; that if we had any Sense of Equity or Justice, we should offer Payment of the Tea &amp;c. I went home some what irritated and heated, and partly to retort upon this Nation, on the Article of Equity, drew up a Memorial to present to Lord Dartmouth before my Departure; but consulting my Friend Mr. Walpole upon it, who is a Member of the House of Commons, he lookt at it and at me several Times alternately, as if he apprehended me a little out of my Senses. As I was in the Hurry of Packing up, I requested him to take the Trouble of showing it to his Neighbour Lord Camden, and ask his Advice upon it, which he kindly undertook to do; and return’d it me, with a Note, which here follows the Memorial.  
  
No 23, 24 (Here insert them.)  
  
Mr. Walpole call’d at my House the next Day, and hearing I was gone to the House of Lords, came there to me, and repeated more fully what was in his Note; adding that it was thought my having no Instructions directing me to deliver such a Protest would make it appear still more unjustifiable, and be deem’d a National Affront. I had no desire to make Matters worse, and being grown cooler took the Advice so kindly given me.  
The Evening before I left London I received a Note from Dr. Fothergill, with some Letters to his Friends in Philadelphia. In that Note he desires me to get those Friends …  The Doctor in the Course of his daily Visits among the Great in the Practice of his Profession, had full Opportunity of being acquainted with their Sentiments, the Conversation every where at this time turning upon the Subject of America.

‘A little before I left London, being at the house of lords, when a  
debate in which lord Camden was to speak, and who indeed spoke ad-  
mirably on American affairs, I was much disgusted, from the ministe-  
rial side, by many base reflections on American courage, religion, un-  
derstanding, &amp;c. in which we were treated with the utmost contempt,  
as the lowest of mankind, and almost of a different species from the  
English of Britain; but particularly the American honesty was abused  
by some of the lords, who asserted that we were all knaves, and wanted  
only by this dispute to avoid paying our debts; that if we had any sense  
of equity or justice, we should offer payment of the tea, kc. I went  
home somewhat irritated and heated; and partly to retort upon this na-  
tion, on the article of eguity, drew up a memorial to present to lord  
Dartmouth before my departure; but consulting my friend Mr. Thomas  
Walpole upon it, who is a member of the house of commons, he looked

tablishing a communication with him, on the part of the ministry,  
it having been, as he remarks, too humiliating for them to apply  
  
to him openly, after the indignities which they had heaped upon  
him at the council board.  
  
‘The new parliament was to meet the 29th of November, (1774.)  
About the beginning of that month, being at the Royal Society, Mr.  
Raper, one of our members, told me there was a certain lady who had  
a desire of playing with me at chess, fancying she could beat me, and  
had requested him to bring me to her: it was, he said, a lady with  
whose acquaintance he was sure I should be pleased, a sister of lord  
Howe’s, and he hoped I would not refuse the challenge. I said, I had  
been long out of practice, but would wait upon the lady when he and  
she should think fit. He told me where her house was, and would have

parliament met, he put me in mind of my promise, and that I had not  
kept it, and would have me name a day when he said he would call tor  
me and conduct me. I named the Friday following. He called ac-  
cordingly: I went with him, played a few games with the lady, whom  
I found of very sensible conversation and pleasing behaviour, which in-  
duced me to agree most readily to an appointment for another meeting  
a few days afterwards. Though I had not the least apprehension that any  
political business could have any connexion with this new acquaintance.’

‘On the Thursday preceding this chess party, Mr. David Barclay  
called on me to have some discourse concerning the meeting of mer-  
chants to petition parliament. When that was over, he spoke of the  
dangerous situation of American affairs, the hazard that a civil war  
might be brought on by the present measures, and the great merit that  
person would have, who could contrive some means of preventing so  
terrible a calamity, and bring about a reconciliation. He was then pleas-  
ed to add, that he was persuaded, from my knowledge of both countries,  
my character and influence in one of them, and my abilities in business,  
no man had it so much in his power as myself. I naturally answered,  
that I should be very happy if I could in any degree be instrumental in  
so good a work, but that I saw no prospect of it; for, though I was sure  
the Americans were always willing and ready to agree upon any equit-  
able terms, yet I thought an accommodation impracticabic, unless both  
sides wished it; and by what I could judge from the proceedings of the  
ministry, I did not believe they had the least disposition towards it; that  
they rather wished to provoke the North American people into an open  
rebellion, which might justify a military execution, and thereby gr atify  
a grounded malice which I conceived to exist here against the wigs and  
&#x27; dissenters of that country. Mr. Barclay apprehended I[ judged too  
  
hardly of the ministers; he was persuaded they were not all of that tem-  
! per, and he fancied they would be very glad to get out of their present  
embarrassment on any terms, only saving the honour and dignity of  
t, government. He wished, therefore, that I would think of the matter,  
‘ and he would call again and converse with me further upon it. I said  
I would do so, as he requested it, but 1 had no opinion of its answering  
any purpose. We parted upon this.’  
  
Two days after, Franklin received from Mr. Barclay and Dr.  
F othergill jointly, an invitation to meet them,—with a view to the  
‘momentous affair,’ at Fothergill’s house the following evening.  
  
‘ The tim’ thus appointed was the evening of the day on which I was  
to have my second chess party with the agreeable Mrs. Howe, whom  
I met accordingly. After playing as long as we liked, we fell into a  
little chat partly on a mathematical preb!em,* and partly about the new  
parliament then just met, when she said, “* And what is to be done with  
this dispute between Great Britain and the colonies? I hope we are not  
to have a civil war.” They should kiss and be friends, said I; what  
can they do better? Quarrelling can be of service to neither, but is ruin

&lt;o both. I have often said,” replied she, “that I wished government  
would employ you to settle the dispute for them; I am sure nobody  
could do it so well. Do not you think that the thing is practicable?”  
Undoubtedly, Madam, if the parties are disposed to reconciliation; for  
the two countries have really no clashing interests to differ about. It  
is rather a matter of punctilio, which two or three reasonable people  
might settle in halfan hour. I thank you for the good opinion you are  
pleased to express of me; but the ministers will never think of employ-  
ing me in that good work; they chuse rather to abuse me. “ Ay,”  
said she, “ they have behaved shamefully to you. And indeed some of  
them are now ashamed of it themselves.” I looked upon this as acci-  
dental conversation, thought no more of it, and went in the evening to  
the appointed meeting at Dr. Fothergill’s, where I found Mr. Barclay  
with him.’

‘On Christmas-day, visiting Mrs. Howe, she told me as soon as I  
went in, that her brother, lord Howe, wished to be acquainted with me;  
that he was a very good man, and she was sure we should like each  
other. I said, I had always heard a good character of lord Howe, and  
should be proud of the honour of being known to him. He is but just  
by, said she; will you give me leave to send for him? By all means,  
Madam, if you think proper. She rang for a servant, wrote a note, and  
lord Howe came in a few minutes.’  
  
His lordship told him, after a long preamble of fine compliments,  
that if he would indulge him with his ideas of the means proper  
to bring about a reconciliation, it might be of some use; that being  
himself upon no ill terms with the ministry, he thought it not im-  
  
possible that by conveying his (Franklin’s) sentiments to them, and

The lady then offered to withdraw, but was prevented by the  
courteous philosopher, who assured her ‘ that he could have no  
secret in such a business which he would not freely confide to her  
prudence.’ After a noble reply to Howe, he consented to prepare

Canada. I afterwards considered Mr. Pitt as an inaccessible; I admired  
him at a distance, and made no more attempts for a nearer acquaintance.  
I had only once or twice the satisfaction of hearing through lord Shel-  
burne, and I think lord Stanhope, that he did me the honour of men-  
tioning me sometimes as a person of respectable character.  
  
¢ But towards the end of August last, returning from Brighthelmstone,  
I called to visit my friend Mr. Sargent, at his seat, Halsted, in Kent,  
agreeably to a former engagement. He let me know, that he had  
promised to conduct me to lord Stanhope’s at Chevening, who expected  
I would call on him when I came into that neighbourhood. We ac-  
cordingly waited on lord Stanhope that evening, who told me lord  
Chatham desired to see me, and that Mr. Sargent’s house, where I was  
to lodge, being in the way, he would call for me there the next morning,  
and carry me to Hayes. This was done accordingly. That truly great  
mian received me with abundance of civility, inquired particularly into  
the situation of affairs in America, spoke feelingly of the severity of  
the late laws against the Massachusetts, gave me some account of his  
speech in opposing them, and expressed great regard and esteem for  
the people of that country, who he hoped would continue firm and uni-  
ted in defending by all peaceable and legal means their constitutional  
rights. I assured him, that [ made no doubt they would do so; which  
he said he was pleased to hear from me, as he was sensible I must be well  
acquainted with them. I remarked to him, that this empire had happily  
found and long been in the practice of a method, whereby every province  
was well governed, being trusted in a great measure with the government  
of itself, and that hence had arisen such satisfaction in the subjects, and  
such encouragement to new settlements, that had it not been for the late  
wrong politics, (which would have parliament to be omaifotent, though  
it ought not to be so unless it could at the same time be omniscient,)  
we might have gone on extending our western empire, adding province  
to province as far as the South Sea. That I lamented the ruin which  
seemed impending over so fine a plan, so well adapted to make all the  
— of the greatest empire happy; and I hoped that if his lordship,  
with the other great and wise men of the British nation, would unite and  
exert themselves, it might yet be rescued out of the mangling hands of  
the present set of blundering ministers; and that the union and harmony  
between Britain and her colonics, so necessary to the welfare of both,  
might be restored.—He replied with great politeness, that my idea of

‘I had promised lord Chatham to communicate to him the first im-  
portant news I should receive from America. I therefore sent him the  
proceedings of the congress as soon as I received them; but a whole  
week passed after I received the petition, before I could, as I wished  
to do, wait upon him with it, in order to obtain his sentiments on the  
whole; for my time was taken up in meetings with the other agents to  
consult about presenting the petition, in waiting three different days with  
them on lord Dartmouth, in consulting upon and writing letters to the  
speakers of assemblies, and other business, which did not allow mie a  
day to goto Hayes. At-last,on Monday the 26th, I got out, and was  
there about one o’clock; he received me with an affectionate kind of  
respect, that from so great a man was extremely engaging; but the  
opinion he expressed of the congress was still more so. They  
had acted, he said, with so much temper, moderation, and wisdom, that  
he thought it the most honourable assembly of statesmen since those of  
the ancient Greeks and Romans, in the most virtuous times. That  
there were not in their whole proceedings, above one or two things he  
could have wished otherwise; perhaps but one, and that was their as-  
sertion, that the keeping up a standing army in the colonies in time of  
peace, without consent of their legislatures, was against law; he doubted  
that was not well founded, and that the law alluded to did not extend  
to the colonies. The rest he admired and honoured. He thought  
the petition decent, manly, and properly expressed. He enquired much  
and particularly concerning the state of America, the probability of  
their perseverance, the difficulties they must meet with in adhering for  
any long time to their resolutions, the resources they might have to  
suppiy the deficiency of commerce, to all which I gave him answers  
with which he scemed well satisfied. He expressed a great regard  
and warm affection for that country, with hearty wishes for their pros-  
perity; and that government here might soon come to see its mistakes,  
and rectify them; and intimated that possibly he might, if his health  
permitted, prepare something for its consideration, when the parliament  
shouid meet after the holiday s; on which he should wish to have pre-  
viously my sentiments.’

he did not doubt they would succeed in establishing their rights, and  
obtain a solid and durable agreement with the mother country; of the  
necessity and great importance of which agreement, he seemed to have  
the strongest impressions.’ * * * * * * *  
  
‘On the 19th of Jan. I received a card from lord Stanhope, acquaint-  
ing me, that Jord Chatham having a motion to make on the morrow in  
the house of lords, concerning America, greatly desired that I might  
be in the house, into which lord S. would endeavour to procure me ad-  
mittance. At this time it was a rule of the house that no person  
could introduce more than one friend. The next morning, his lordship  
let me know by another card, that if I attended at two o’clock in the  
  
lobby, lord Chatham would be there about that time, and would himself  
  
introduce me. I attended, and met him there accordingly. On my  
mentioning to him what lord Stanhope had written to me, he said, * Cer-  
tainly; and I shall do it with the more pleasure, as Iam sure your being  
present at this day’s debate will be of more service to America than  
mine;” and so taking me by the arm, was leading me along the passage  
to the door that enters near the throne, when one of the door-keepers  
followed and acquainted him that by the order, none were to be carried  
in at that door, but the eldest sons or brothers of peers; on which he  
limped back with me to the door near the bar, where were standing a  
number of gentlemen waiting for the peers who were to introduce  
them, and sume peers waiting for friends they expected to introduce;  
among whom he delivered me to the doorkeepers, say ing aloud, this is  
Dr. Franklin, whom I would have admitted into the house; when they  
readily opened the door for me accordingly. As it had not been pub-  
licly known that there was any communication between his lordship  
and me, this I found occasioned some speculation.’  
  
‘I was quite charmed with lord Chatham’s speech in support of his  
motion.* He impressed me with the highest idea of him as a great and  
most able statesman.’

‘On Wednesday, lord Stanhope, at lord Chatham’s request, called  
upon me, and carried me down to the house of lords, which was soon  
very full. Lord Chatham in amost excellent speech, introduced, ex-  
plained, and supported his plan. When he sat down, lord Dartmouth  
rose, and very properly said, it contained matter of such weight and  
magnitude, as to require much consideration, and he therefore hoped  
the noble earl did not expect their lordships to decide upon it by an  
immediate vote, but would be willing it should lie upon the table for  
consideration. Lord Chatham answered readily that he expected  
nothing more. But lord Sandwich rose, and ina petulant vehement  
speech, opposed its being received at all, and gave his opinion that it  
ought to be immediately rejected, with the contempt it deserved. That  
he could never believe it to be the production of any British peer. That  
it appeared to him rather the work of some American; and turning his  
face towards me, who was leaning on the bar, said, he fancied he had in  
his eye the person who drew it up, one of the bitterest and most mis-  
chievous enemies this country had ever known. This drew the eyes  
of many lords upon me: but as I had no inducement to take it to my-  
self, I kept my countenance as immoveable as if my features had been  
made of wood.’  
  
‘Lord Chatham, in his reply to lord Sandwich, took notice of his illi-  
beral insinuation that the plan was not the person’s, who proposed it:  
declared that it was entirely his own, a declaration he thought himself  
the more obliged to make, as many of their lordships appeared to have  
so mean an opinion of it; for if it was so weak or bad a thing, it was  
proper in him to take care that no other person should unjustly share  
in the censure it deserved. That it had been heretofore reckoned his  
vice not to be apt to take advice; but he made no scruple to declare,  
that if he were the first minister of this country, and had the care of  
settling this momentous business, he should not be ashamed of publicly  
calling to his assistance, a person so perfectly acquainted with the whole  
of American affairs as the gentleman alluded to and so injuriousiy re-  
flected on; one, he was pleased to say, whom all Europe held in high  
  
estimation, for his knowledge and wisdom, and ranked with our Boyles  
and Newtons: who was an honour, not to the English nation only, but to  
human nature! I found it harder to stand this extravagant compliment  
than the preceding equally extravagant abuse; but kept as well as I  
could an unconcerned countenance, as not conceiving it to relate to me.’

the morrow in the house of lords, concerning America, greatly  
desired that I might be in the house, into which Lord S. would  
endeavor to procure me admittance. At this time it was a rule of

one of the door-keepers followed and acquainted him that by the  
  
‘order, none were to be carried in at that door, but the eldest song  
  
or brothers of peers; on which he limped back with me to the  
  
door near the bar, where were standing a number of gentlemen  
  
waiting for the peers who were to introduce them, and some peers  
waiting for friends they expected to introduce; among whom he  
delivered me to the door-keepers, saying aloud, this is Dr. Franklin,  
whom I would have admitted into the house ; when they readily  
opened the door for me accordingly. As it had not been pub.  
licly known that there was any communication between his lord.  
ship and me, this I found occasioned some speculation. His a  
pearance in the house, I observed, caused a kind of bustle among  
the officers, who were hurried in sencing messengers for mem.  
bers, I suppose those in connection with the ministry, something  
of importance being expected when that great man appears; it  
being but seldom that his infirmities permit his attendance,  
{ had great satisfaction in hearing his motion and the debate upon  
it. which I shall not attempt to give here an account of, as you  
may find a better in the papers of the time. It was his motion  
for withdrawing the troops from Boston, as the first step towards  
an accommodation. The day following, I received a note from Lord  
Stanhope expressing, that “ at the desire of Lord Chatham was  
sent me inclosed, the motion he made in the house of Lords, that I  
might be possessed of it in the most authentic manner, by the  
communication of the individual paper which was read to the  
house by the mover himself.” I sent copies of this motion to  
America, and was the more pleased with it, as I conceived it had  
partly taken its rise from a hint [I had given his lordship in a  
former convé:sation. It follows in these words.  
  
Lord Chatham’s Motion, June 20, 1775.  
  
‘‘ That an humble address be presented to his majesty, most  
humbly to advise and beseech his majesty, that, in order to open  
the way towards an happy settlement of the dangerous troubles  
in America, by beginning to allay ferments and soften animosities  
there ; and above all, for preventing in the mean time any sudden  
and fatal catastrophe at Boston,.now suffering under the daily  
irritation of an army before their eyes, posted in their town, 1t  
  
‘may graciously please his majesty, that immediate orders may  
  
be dispatched to General Gage for removing his majesty’s forces  
from the town of Boston, as soon as the rigor of the season and  
other circumstances, indispensable to the safety and accommo-  
dation of the said troops, may render the same practicable ”

of his motion.* He impressed me with the highest idea of him

argument, as did several other lords, who spoke excellently well ;  
but all availed no more than the whistling of the winds, The  
motion was rejected. Sixteen Scotch peers, and twenty-four

“‘] fancy I have in my eye the person who drew it up,—one of  
the bitterest and most mischievous enemies that this country has  
ever known.” Under this allusion, so severe and offensive, al-  
though it drew upon him the observation of the whole assembly,  
Franklin remained, as if unconscious of the application, with a  
composed aspect ; or to use his own expression in relating this  
story, ‘‘as if his countenance had been made of wood.” Lord  
Chatham replied, that were he the first minister of the country,  
he should not be ashamed to “call publicly to his assistance, a  
person so eminently acquainted with American affairs, as the  
gentleman alluded to, and so ungenerously reflected on ; one,” he  
added, ** whom all Europe holds in the highest estimation for his  
knowledge and wisdom; whom she ranks with her Boyles and  
her Newtons; who is an honor, not to the English nation only,  
but to human nature.” ’ pp. 91—93.

he replied, with a decisive plainness, That the

a place in a cart to Tyburn than any other  
place whatever: and when the same agent, in  
a conversation which was to be exactly repeated  
to the ministers, observed how necessary an  
agreement was for America, since it was so  
easy for Britain to burn all her sea-port towns,  
the aged patriot gave this answer, of which the  
spirit should be eternal among his countrymen:

of houses in those towns; you may make bon-

“On Wednesday, Lord Stanhope, at Lord Chatham’s request,  
called upon me, and carried me down to the house of lords, which  
was soon very full. Lord Chatham, in a most excellent speech, in-  
troduced, explained and supported his plan. When he sat down,  
Lord Dartmouth rose, and very properly said, it contained matter of  
such weight and magnitude as to require much consideration, and  
therefore he hoped the noble earl did not expect their lordships to  
decide upon it by an immediate vote, but would be willing it should  
lie on the table for consideration. Lord Chatham answered readily,  
that he expected nothing more. But Lord Sandwich rose, and in a  
petulant, vehement speech, oppused its being received at all, and  
gave his opinion, that it ought to be immediately rejected, with the  
contempt it deserved ; that he could never believe it to be the pro-  
duction of any British peer ; that it appeared to him rather the work  
of some American; and turning his face towards me, who was lean-  
ing on the bar, said, he fancied he had in his eye the person who  
drew it up, one of the bitterest and most mischievous enemies this  
country had ever known.” “ Lord Chatham, in his reply to Lord  
Sandwich, took notice of his illiberal insinuation, that the plan was  
not the person’s who proposed it ; declared that it was entirely his  
own, a declaration he thought himself the more obliged to make, as  
many of their lordships appeared to have so mean an opinion of it;  
for if it was so weak or so bad a thing, it was proper in him to take  
care that no other person should unjustly share in the censure it de-  
served, That it had heretofore been reckoned his vice not to take ad-  
vice ; but he made no scruple to declare, that if he were the first  
minister of this country [which he afterwards was] and had the care  
of settling this momentous business, he should not be ashamed of  
publicly calling to his assistance, a person so wholly acquainted with  
American affairs as the gentleman alluded to, and so injuriously re-  
flected on; one, he was pleased to say, whom all Europe held in  
high estimation, for his knowledge and wisdom, and ranked with  
our Boyles and Newtons ; who was an honour, not to the English  
— only, but to human nature !”—Vol. 1. Memoirs, pp. 323

reasonable people might settle in half an hour. I thank you for

On Christmas-day, visiting Mrs. Howe, she told him as soon  
as he came in, that her brother, Lord Howe, wished to be ae-  
quainted with him; that he was a very good man, and she was  
sure they would like each other. Franklin replied, that he had  
always heard a good character of Lord Howe, and should be  
proud of the honour of being known to him. He is but just by,  
said she, will you give me leave to send for him? She rang for a

In one of these it came out that Howe had seen a copy of the  
Doctor&#x27;s celebrated ‘ Hints for Conversation about Terms,’ &amp;c.  
Lord Howe (writes Franklin) said, ‘he was rather sorry to find  
that the sentiments expressed in that paper were mine, as it gave  
‘him less hope of promoting, by my assistance, the wished-for  
reconciliation, since he had reason to think there was no likelihood  
of the adoption of those propositions. He hoped, however, that I  
would reconsider the subject, and form some plan that would be  
acceptable here. He expatiated on the infinite service it would  
be to the nation, and the great merit in being instrumental in so  
good a work ;—that he should not think of influencing me by any  
selfish motive, but certainly I might with reason expect any  
reward in the power of government to bestow. This to me (con-  
tinues Franklin) was what the French vulgarly call spitting in the  
soup. However, I promised to draw some sketch of a plan at  
his request, though I much doubted, I said, whether it would be  
thought preferable to that he had in his hand. In ences

* He let me know,’ says Franklin, ‘ that he was thought of to be sent

excess of politeness, that sensible of his own unacquaintedness with the

great work. of reconciliation ; the influence I had over the minds of  
people in America was known to. be very extensive, and I could, if any  
man could, prevail with them to comply with reasonable propositions.  
I replied, that I was obliged to his lordship for the favourable opinion  
he had of me, and for the honour he did me in proposing to make use  
of my assistance. I wished to know what propositions were intended  
for America; if they were reasonable ones in themselves, possibly I  
might be able to make them appear such to my countrymen; but if  
they were otherwise, I doubted whether that could be done by any man,  
and certainly I should not undertake it.. His lordship then said, that he  
should not expect my assistance without a. proper consideration ; the  
business was of great importance, and if-he undertook it, he should  
insist on being enabled to make generous and ample appointments for  
those he took with him, particularly for me; as well asa firm promise  
of subsequent reward, And, said he, “that the ministry may have  
an opporiunity of showing their good disposition towards yourself, will  
you give me leave, Mr. Franklin, to procure for you previously some  
mark of it? Suppose the payment here of the arrears of your salary as  
agent for New England, which I understand they have stopped for some  
time past.” “* My Lord,” said I, “1 shall deem it-a great honour to  
be in any shape joined with your lordship in&#x27;so good a work; but if  
you hope service from any influence I may be supposed to have, drop all  
thoughts of procuring me any previous favours from ministers; my ac-  
cepting them would destroy the very influence you propose to make use  
of ; they would be considered as so many bribes to betray the interest of  
my country. But only let me see the propositions, and if I approve of  
them, I shall not hesitate a moment, but will hold myself ready to ac-  
company your lordship at an hour&#x27;s warning.””’ ;,  
. At this time it was currently and industriously reported that  
Lord North meant to make a pacific motion for healing all. dif-  
ferences with America. Franklin expresses a suspicion that the  
motion that was. intended, was not that. which was made. ‘The  
Bedford party,’ he says, ‘inimical to America, and who had  
urged severe measures, were alarmed, and began to exclaim  
against the minister for his timidity and the fluctuation of his  
politics ; they even began to count voices, to see if they could not,  
by negativing his motion, at once unhorse him and throw him out  
of the administration. His friends were therefore alarmed for  
him, and there was much caballing and whispering.’ No one who  
now, at the distance of two generations, considers this portion of  
history dispassionately, can entertain a doubt that Lord North&#x27;s  
motion was intended to bring about a conciliation. It was treated

*He began,” says Franklin, ‘by saying that I had been a per gt  
phet than himselfin foreseeing that my interview with Lord Hyde  
would be of no great use; and then said he hoped I would excuse the  
trouble he had given me, as his intentions had been good both towards  
me and the public. He was sorry that at present there was no appear-  
ance of things going into the train he had wished, but possibly they  
might yet take a more favourable turn ; and as he unders I was going  
soon to America, if he should chance to be sent thither on this im-  
portant business, he hoped he might still expect my assistance. I as-  
sured him of my readiness at all times to co-operate with him in so good  
a work; and so taking my leave, and receiving his good wishes, ended  
the negociation with Lord Howe.’

an opinion prevailing here, that America aimed at setting up for  
itself as an independent state, Franklin says, ‘I assured him that  
having more than once travelled almost from one end of the con-

drinking, and conversing with them freely, I never had heard  
in any conversation, from any person, drunk or sober, the least

Barclay and Dr. Fothergill as to Lord Howe. He declared his  
belief to them that the ministry wished to provoke the North  
American people into an open rebellion, which might justify a  
military execution, and thereby gratify the grounded malice which  
he conceived to exist here against the Whigs and Dissenters of  
that country. These conciliators, as they professed themselves to  
be, were influenced by the same violent prejudices. A few days  
before he embarked for Philadelphia, they commissioned him ‘ to  
assure their friends from them that it was now their fixed opinion  
that nothing could secure the privileges of America, but a firm,  
sober adherence to the terms of the association made at the  
Congress, and that the salyation of English liberty depended now  
on the perseverance and virtue of America.’ The evening before  
he left London he received a note from Dr. Fothergill, with some  
letters to his correspondents in Philadelphia. ‘In that note, he  
desires me,’ says Franklin, ‘to get those friends and two or three  
more together, and inform them that whatever specious pretences  
are offered, they are all hollow; and that to get a larger field on  
which to fatten a herd of worthless parasites is all that is regarded.

open.  
‘He let me know,” says Franklin, “ that he was thought of to be sent commis-  
&#x27; sioner for settling the differences in America; adding, with an excess of polite-  
ness, that sensible of his own unacquaintedness with the business, and of my  
knowledge and abilities, he could not think of undertaking it without me; but  
with me he should do it most readily, for he should found his expectation of suc-  
cess on my assistance. He therefore had desired this meeting, to know my mind  
| upon a proposition of my going with him, in some shape or other, asa friend, an  
assistant, or secretary ; that he was very sensible if he should be so happy as to  
effect anything valuable, it must be wholly owing to the advice and assistance |  
should afford him ; that he should therefore make no scruple of giving me, upon  
all occasions, the full honour uf it; that he had declared to the ministers his  
opinion of my good disposition towards peace, and what he now wished was to  
| be authorised by me to say that I consented to accompany him, and would co-  
| operate with him in the great work of reconciliation; the influence I had over  
  
  
  
| the minds «f people in America was known to be very extensive, and I could, if |  
  
| any man could, prevail with them tocomply with reasonable propositions. I re-  
| plied, that I was obliged to his Lordship for the favourable opinion he had of  
| me, and for the honor he did me in proposing to make use of my assistance. |  
| wished to know what propositions were intended for Aimerica; if they were rea-  
| sonable ones in themselves, possibly I might be able to make them appear such  
to my countrymen; but if they were otherwise, I doubted whether that could  
| be done by any man, and certainly I should not undertake it. His lordship then  
| said, that he should not expect my assis‘ance without a proper consideration ; the  
| business was of great importance, and if he unJertook it, he should insist on  
| being enabled to make generous and ample appointments for those he took with  
| him, particularly for me ; as well as a firm promise of subsequent reward. And,  
| said he, ** that the ministry may have an opportunity of showing their good dis-  
position towards yourse&#x27;f, will you give me leave, Mr. Franklin, to procure for  
| you previously some mark of it! Suppose the payment here of the arrears of  
| your salary as agent for New England, which I understand they have stopped for  
| some time past.”’ ‘* My Lord,” said I, *‘ I shall deem it a great honour to be in  
, any shape joined with your lordship in so good a work; butif you hope service  
  
from any influence I may be supposed to have, drop all thoughts of procuring me  
any previous favours from ministers ; my accepting them would destroy the very  
  
influence you propose to make use of ; they would be considered as so wnany bribes |  
  
to betray the interest of my country. But only let me see the propositions, and  
if I approve of them, I shall not hesitate a moment, but will hold myself ready  
| to accompany your lordship at an hour&#x27;s warning.”  
| At this time it was currently and industriously reported that Lord North meant  
to make a pacific motion for healing all differences with America.  
| presses a suspicion that the motion that was intended was not that which was  
;tmade. ‘ The Bedford party,” he says, “inimical te America, and who had  
urged severe measures, were alarmed, and began to exclaim against the minister  
for his timidity and the fluctuation of his politics; they even began to count  
voices, to see if they could not, by negativing his motion, at once unhorse him  
| and throw him out of the administration. His friends were therefere alarmed  
for him, and there was much caballing and whispering.” No one who now, at

try wished to provoke the North American people into an open rebellion, which  
might justify a military execution, and thereby gratify the grounded malice which  
he conceived to exist here against the Whigs and Dissenters of that country.  
These conciliators, as they professed themselves to be, were influenced by the  
same violent prejudices. A few days before he embarked for Philadelphia, they  
commissioned him “to assure their friends from them that it was now their fixed  
opinion that nothing could secure the privileges of America, but a firm, sober ad-  
herence to the terms of the association made at the Congress, and that the sal-  
vation of English liberty depended now on the perseverence and virtue of Amer-  
ica.” The evening before he left London he received a note from Dr. Fother-

she was a lady with whose acquaintance he could not  
fail to be pleased, and Mr. Raper hoped he would not  
refuse the challenge. ‘I said,’ says Franklin, ‘I had  
been long out of practice, but would wait upon the lady  
when he and she should think fit. He told me where  
her house was, and would have me call soon and with-  
out further introduction, which I undertook to do, but  
thinking it a little awkward I postponed it. Meeting  
him again at the feast of the Society’s election, being  
the day after the Parliament met, he put me in mind of  
my promise, and would have me name a day, when he  
said he would call for me and conduct me. He called  
accordingly. I went with him, played a few games  
with the lady, whom I found of very sensible conver-  
sation and pleasing behaviour, which induced me to  
agree most readily to an appointment for another meet-  
ing a few days afterwards, though I had not the least  
apprehension that any political business could have

says, ‘the lady, which is a little unusual in ladies, had  
a good deal of mathematical knowledge,’) and partly  
upon the new Parliament then just met, when she said,  
‘And what is to be done with this dispute between  
Great Britain and the Colonies? I hope we are not to  
have a civil war.’ Franklin replied, “They should kiss  
and be friends; what can they do better? Quarrelling  
can be of service to neither, but is ruin to both.’ Mrs.  
Howe replied, ‘I have often said, that I wished go-  
vernment would employ you to settle the dispute for  
them; I am sure nobody could do it so well. Do not  
you think that the thing is practicable?’ ‘Undoubtedly,  
Madam,’ he made answer, ‘if the parties are disposed  
to reconciliation, for the two countries have really no  
clashing interests to differ about it. It is rather a mat-  
ter of punctilio, which two or three reasonable people  
might settle in half an hour. I thank you for the good

opinion you are pleased to express of me; but the minis-  
ters will never think of employing me in that good  
work, they choose rather to abuse me.’ ‘Ay,’ said  
she, ‘they have behaved shamefully to you; and, in-  
deed, some of them are now ashamed of it themselves.’ ’  
Franklin looked upon this as accidental conversation,  
and thought no more of it.  
  
On Christmas-day, visiting Mrs. Howe, she told him  
as soon as he came in, that her brother, Lord Howe,  
wished to be acquainted with him; that he was a very  
good man, and she was sure they would like each  
other. Franklin replied, that he had always heard a  
good character of Lord Howe, and should be proud of  
the honour of being known to him. He is but just  
by, said she, will you give me leave to send for him?  
She rang for a servant, wrote a note, and Lord Howe  
came in a few minutes, for he lived next door to his  
mother and sister. Franklin proceeds to detail various  
interviews between himself and his lordship. In one  
of these it came out that Howe had seen a copy of  
the Doctor’s celebrated ‘Hints for Conversation about  
Terms,’ &amp;c. Lord Howe (writes Franklin) said, she  
was rather sorry to find that the sentiments expressed  
in that paper were mine, as it gave him less hope of  
promoting, by my assistance, the wished-for recon-  
ciliation, since he had reason to think there was no  
likelihood of the adoption of those propositions. He  
hoped, however, that I would reconsider the subject,  
and form some plan that would be acceptable here.  
He expatiated on the infinite service it would be to  
the nation, and the great merit in being instrumental  
in so good a work;—that he should not think of in-  
fluencing me by any selfish motive, but certainly I  
might with reason expect any reward in the power of  
government to bestow. This to me (continues Frank-  
lin) was what the French vulgarly call spitting in the  
soup. However, I promised to draw some sketch of  
a plan at his request, though I much doubted, I said,  
whether it would be thought preferable to that he had  
in his hand. In general,’ says he, ‘I liked much his  
manner, and found myself disposed to place great con-  
fidence in him on occasions.’

‘He let me know,’ says Franklin, ‘that he was thought  
of to be sent commissioner for settling the differences  
in America; adding, with an excess of politeness, that  
sensible of his own unacquaintedness with the busi-  
ness, and of my knowledge and abilities, he could not  
think of undertaking it without me; but with me he  
should do it most readily, for he should found his ex-  
pe of success on my assistance. He therefore  
  
ad desired this meeting, to know my mind upon a pro-  
position of my going with him, in some shape or other,  
as a friend, an assistant, or secretary; that he was very  
sensible if he should be so happy as to effect anything  
valuable, it must be wholly owing to the advice and as-  
sistance I should afford him; that he should therefore  
make no scruple of giving me, upon all occasions, the  
full honour of it; that he had declared to the ministers  
his opinion of my good disposition towards peace, and  
what he now wished was to be authorized by me to  
say that I consented to accompany him, and would co-  
operate with him in the great work of reconciliation;  
the influence I had over the minds of people in America  
was known to be very extensive, and I could, if any  
man could, prevail with them to comply with reason-  
able propositions. I replied, that I was obliged to his  
lordship for the favourable opinion he had of me, and  
for the honour he did me in proposing to make use of  
my assistance. I wished to know what propositions  
were intended for America; if they were reasonable  
ones in themselves, possibly I might be able to make  
them appear such to my countrymen; but if they were  
otherwise, I doubted whether that could be done by  
any man, and certainly I should not undertake it. His  
lordship then said, that he should not expect my as-  
sistance without a proper consideration; the business  
was of great importance, and if he undertook it, he  
should insist on being enabled to make generous and  
ample appointments for those he took with him, particu-  
larly for me; as well as a firm promise of subsequent re-  
ward. And, said he, ‘that the ministry may have an  
opportunity of showing their good disposition towards  
yourself, will you give me leave, Mr. Franklin, to pro-  
cure for you previously some mark of it? Suppose the  
  
ayment here of the arrears of your salary as agent for  
New England, which I understand they have stopped  
  
  
  
for some time past.’ ‘My Lord,’ said I, ‘I shall deen §  
it a great honour to be in any shape joined with your  
lordship in so good a work; but if you hope service  
from any influence I may be meek to have, drop all  
thoughts of procuring me any previous favours from  
ministers; my accepting them would destroy the ve  
influence you propose to make use of; they would be f  
considered as so many bribes to betray the interest of  
my country. But only let me see the propositions, and  
if Il approve of them, I shall not hesitate a moment, but  
will hold myself ready to accompany your lordship at  
an hour’s warning.’’  
  
At this time it was currently and industriously rm.  
ported that Lord North meant to make a pacific motion  
for healing all differences with America. Frankliy  
expresses a suspicion that the motion that was intend.  
ed was not that which was made. “The Bedford party,  
he says, ‘inimical to America, and who had urged  
severe measures, were alarmed, and began to exclaim  
against the minister for his timidity and the fluctuation  
of his politics; they even began to count voices, to see  
if they could, by negativing his motion, at once unhorse  
him and throw him out of the administration. His f  
friends were therefore alarmed for him, and there was  
much caballing and whispering.’ No one who now,  
at the distance of two generations, considers this por  
tion of history dispassionately, can entertain a doubt  
that Lord North’s motion was intended to bring abou

Lord Howe.  
  
‘He began,’ says Franklin, ‘by saying that I had  
been a better prophet than himself in foreseeing that my  
interview with Lord Hyde would be of no great use;  
and then said he hoped I would excuse the trouble he |  
had given me, as his intentions had been good both  
towards me and the public. He was sorry that at pre  
sent there was no appearance of things going into the  
train he had wished, but possibly they might yet take  
amore favourable turn; and as he understood I was  
going soon to America, if he should chance to be sent  
thither on this important business, he hoped he might  
still expect my assistance. I assured him of my readi-  
ness at all times to co-operate with him in so good a

Lord Chatham (which was during the intercourse with  
Lord Howe), upon Lord Chatham mentioning an  
opinion prevailing here, that America aimed at setting  
up for itself as an independent state, Franklin says, ‘I

conversing with them freely, I never had heard in any

such a thing would be advantageous to America.’

language to Barclay and Dr. Fothergill as to Lord  
Howe. He declared his belief to them that the minis-  
try wished to provoke the North American people into  
an open rebellion, which might justify a military exe-  
cution, and thereby gratify the grounded malice which  
he conceived to exist here against the Whigs and Dis-  
senters of that country. These conciliators, as they  
professed themselves to be, were influenced by the  
same violent prejudices. A few days before he em-  
barked for Philadelphia, they commissioned him ‘to  
assure their friends from them that it was now their  
fixed opinion that nothing could secure the privileges  
of America, but a firm, sober adherence to the terms  
of the association made at the Congress, and that the  
salvation of English liberty depended now on the per-

severance and virtue of America.’ The evening before  
he left London he received a note from Dr. Fothergill,  
with some letters to his correspondents in Philadelphia.

Shortly after this, when Lord Chatham, after thinking long and  
closely upon the subject, had proposed in the House of Lords a plan  
for healing all differences and restoring peace to the empire, Frank-  
  
lin, being told by Lord Mahon that Chatham was very desirous of  
  
seeing him, set out for Hayes. “On Friday, the 27th,” says Frank-  
lin himself, “1 took a postchaise about nine o&#x27;clock, and got to  
Hayes about eleven ; but my attention being engaged in reading a new  
pamphlet, the postboy drove me a mile or two beyond the gate. His  
lordship, being out on an airing in his chariot, had met me, before I  
reached Hayes, unobserved by me, turned and followed me, and not  
finding me there, concluded, as he had seen me reading, that I had  
passed by mistake, and sent a servant after me.” This is very charac

Dissenter, and Chathamite friends could scarcely believe in  
such a schism in the imperial unity. Even at the moment of  
recognising the independence of the United States, seven years  
later, statesmen looked forward to a possible return of the  
colonies to their allegiance. No Englishman could compre-  
hend, as Franklin could, the capacity of the colonies for  
standing alone. In exhorting, when the British ministers had

In August, 1774, although the Americans were  
then busily arming themselves for the strug­

no agitation for political independence in the  
colonies. He told Chatham that, &quot;having

when it had been urged against the assem­

Justice, the assemblies usually replied that  
making them dependent on the crown for

make an undue Influence over the courts,  
and one undue influence was a proper bal­

When he sat down, Lord Sandwich rose and in a petulant speech  
opposed its being received at all. He said it should be rejected  
with the contempt it deserved, and he could not believe it to be  
the production of any British peer; that it appeared to him rather  
the work of some American; and, turning his face toward Dr.  
Franklin ( who was leaning on the bar ), said that ‘‘ he fancied he  
had in his eye the person who drew it up—one of the bitterest  
and most mischievous enemies this country had ever known.”’  
This turned-the eyes of all the lords upon the insulted Ameri-  
can, who, with the self-command peculiar to great minds, kept  
his countenance unmoved. Lord Chatham, in reply to Lord  
Sandwich, declared the bill proposed by him to be entirely his  
own—  
  
But he made no scruple to declare that if he were Prime Minister and  
had the care of settling this momentous business he should not be ashamed  
  
of calling to his assistance a person so perfectly acquainted with Ameri-  
can affairs as the gentleman alluded toand so injuriously reflected upon,  
Dr. Franklin—one whom all Europe held in high estimation for his  
knowledge and wisdom, and ranked with the Boyles and Newtons—who  
was an honor not only to the English nation, but to human nature.
