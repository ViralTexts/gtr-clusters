eader,  
October 7. 1739  
  
You may remember that in my first Almanack, published for the Year 1733, I predicted the Death of my dear Friend Titan Leeds, Philomat. to happen that Year on the 17th Day of October, 3 h. 29 m. P.M. The good Man, it seems, died accordingly: But W.B. and A.B. have continued to publish Almanacks in his Name ever since; asserting for some Years that he was still living; At length when the Truth could no longer be conceal’d from the World, they confess his Death in their Almanack for 1739, but pretend that he died not till last Year, and that before his Departure he had furnished them with Calculations for 7 Years to come. Ah, My Friends, these are poor Shifts and thin Disguises; of which indeed I should have taken little or no Notice, if you had not at the same time accus’d me as a false Predictor; an Aspersion that the more affects me, as my whole Livelyhood depends on a contrary Character.  
  
But to put this Matter beyond Dispute, I shall acquaint the World with a Fact, as strange and surprizing as it is true; being as follows, viz.  
On the 4th Instant, towards midnight, as I sat in my little Study writing this Preface, I fell fast asleep; and continued in that Condition for some time, without dreaming any thing, to my Knowledge. On awaking, I found lying before me the following Letter, viz.  
  
“Dear Friend Saunders,  
  
“My Respect for you continues even in this separate State, and I am griev’d to see the Aspersions thrown on you by the Malevolence of avaricious Publishers of Almanacks, who envy your Success. They say your Prediction of my Death in 1733 was false, and they pretend that I remained alive many Years after. But I do hereby certify, that I did actually die at that time, precisely at the Hour you mention’d, with a Variation only of 5 min. 53 sec. which must be allow’d to be no great matter in such Cases. And I do farther declare that I furnish’d them with no Calculations of the Planets Motions, &amp;c. seven Years after my Death, as they are pleased to give out: so that the Stuff they publish as an Almanack in my Name is no more mine than ’tis yours.  
“You will wonder perhaps, how this Paper comes written on your Table. You must know that no separate Spirits are under any Confinement till after the final Settlement of all Accounts. In the mean time we wander where we please, visit our old Friends, observe their Actions, enter sometimes into their Imaginations, and give them Hints waking or sleeping that may be of Advantage to them. Finding you asleep, I entred your left Nostril, ascended into your Brain, found out where the Ends of those Nerves were fastned that move your right Hand and Fingers, by the Help of which I am now writing unknown to you; but when you open your Eyes, you will see that the Hand written is mine, tho’ wrote with yours.  
“The People of this Infidel Age, perhaps, will hardly believe this Story. But you may give them these three Signs by which they shall be convinc’d of the Truth of it. About the middle of June next, J. J----n, Philomat, shall be openly reconciled to the Church of Rome, and give all his Goods and Chattles to the Chappel, being perverted by a certain Country Schoolmaster. On the 7th of September following my old Friend W.B----t shall be sober 9 Hours, to the Astonishment of all his Neighbours: And about the same time W.B. and A.B. will publish another Almanack in my Name, in spight of Truth and Common-Sense.  
“As I can see much clearer into Futurity, since I got free from the dark Prison of Flesh, in which I was continually molested and almost blinded with Fogs arising from Tiff, and the Smoke of burnt Drams; I shall in kindness to you, frequently give you Informations of things to come, for the Improvement of your Almanack: Being Dear Dick, Your affectionate Friend,  
  
T. Leeds”  
  
For my own part I am convinc’d that the above Letter is genuine. If the Reader doubts of it, let him carefully observe the three Signs; and if they do not actually come to pass, believe as he pleases. I am his humble Friend,  
  
R. Saunders

printed.]  
Some of these Eclipses foreshow great Grief and many Tears among the soft Sex this Year; whether for the Breaking of their Crockery Ware, the Loss of their Loves, or in Repentance for their Sins, I shall not say; tho’ I must own I think there will be a great deal of the latter in the Case. War we shall hear but too much of (for all Christians have not yet learn’d to love one another) and, I doubt, of some ineffectual Treaties of Peace. I pray Heav’n defend these Colonies from every Enemy; and give them, Bread enough, Peace enough, Money enough, and plenty of good Cyder.  
  
XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.  
  
My sickly Spouse, with many a Sigh  
Once told me,—Dicky I shall die:  
I griev’d, but recollected strait,  
’Twas bootless to contend with Fate:  
So Resignation to Heav’n’s Will  
Prepar’d me for succeeding Ill;  
’Twas well it did; for, on my Life,  
’Twas Heav’n’s Will to spare my Wife.  
  
To bear other Peoples afflictions, every one has Courage enough, and to spare.  
  
No wonder Tom grows fat, th’ unwieldy Sinner,  
Makes his whole Life but one continual Dinner.  
  
An empty Bag cannot stand upright.  
XII Mon. February hath xxviii days.  
  
While the good Priest with eyes devoutly clos’d  
Left on the book the marriage fee expos’d,  
The new made bridegroom his occasion spies,  
And pleas’d, repockets up the shining prize:  
Yet not so safe, but Mr. Surplice views  
The Frolick, and demands his pilfer’d dues.  
No, quoth the man, good Doctor, I’ll nonsuit y’,  
A plain default, I found you off your Duty?  
More carefully the holy book survey;  
Your Rule is, you should watch as well as pray.  
  
Happy that nation, fortunate that age, whose history is not diverting.  
  
What is a butterfly? At best  
He’s but a caterpiller drest.  
The gaudy Fop’s his picture just.  
  
None are deceived but they that confide.  
  
I Mon. March hath xxxi days.  
  
When Pharoah’s Sins provok’d th’ Almighty’s hand  
To pour his Wrath upon the guilty Land;  
A tenfold Plague the great Avenger shed;  
The King offended, and the Nation bled.  
Had’st thou, unaided, Feria, but been sent,  
Vial elect, for Pharoah’s Punishment,  
Thro’ what a various Curse the Wretch had run,  
He more than heaven’s ten Plagues had felt in one.  
  
An open Foe may prove a curse;  
But a pretended friend is worse.  
  
A wolf eats sheep but now and then,  
Ten Thousands are devour’d by Men.  
  
Man’s tongue is soft, and bone doth lack;  
Yet a stroke therewith may break a man’s back.  
  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
  
Says Roger to his Wife, my dear;  
The strangest piece of News I hear!  
A Law, ’tis said, will quickly pass,  
To purge the matrimonial Class;  
Cuckolds, if any such we have here  
Must to a Man be thrown i’ th’ River.  
She smiling cry’d, My dear, you seem  
Surpriz’d! Pray han’t you learn’d to swim?  
  
Many a Meal is lost for want of meat.  
  
To all apparent Beauties blind  
Each Blemish strikes an envious Mind.  
  
The Poor have little, Beggars none;  
The Rich too much, enough not one.  
  
III Mon. May hath xxxi days.  
  
A Carrier ev’ry Night and Morn,  
Would see his Horses eat their Corn:  
This sunk the Hostler’s Vails, ’tis true;  
But then his Horses had their Due.  
Were we so cautious in all Cases,  
Small Gain would rise from greater Places.  
  
There are lazy Minds as well as lazy Bodies.  
Tricks and Treachery are the Practice of Fools, that have not Wit enough to be honest.  
Who says Jack is not generous? He is always fond of giving, and cares not for receiving.—What? Why; Advice.  
IV Mon. June hath xxx days.  
  
How weak, how vain is human Pride!  
Dares Man upon himself confide?  
The Wretch who glories in his Gain,  
Amasses Heaps on Heaps in vain.  
Can those (when tortur’d by Disease)  
Chear our sick Heart, or purchase Ease?  
Can those prolong one Gasp of Breath,  
Or calm the troubled Hour of Death?  
  
The Man who with undaunted toils,  
Sails unknown seas to unknown soils,  
With various wonders feasts his Sight:  
What stranger wonders does he write?  
  
Fear not Death; for the sooner we die, the longer shall we be immortal.  
V Mon. July hath xxxi days.  
  
The Monarch of long regal Line,  
Was rais’d from Dust as frail as mine:  
  
Can he pour Health into his Veins,  
Or cool the Fever’s restless Pains?  
Can he (worn down in Nature’s Course)  
New-brace his feeble Nerves with Force?  
Can he (how vain is mortal Pow’r!)  
Stretch Life beyond the destin’d Hour?  
  
Those who in quarrels interpose,  
Must often wipe a bloody nose.  
  
Promises may get thee Friends, but Nonperformance will turn them into Enemies.  
  
In other men we faults can spy,  
And blame the mote that dims their eye;  
Each little speck and blemish find;  
To our own stronger errors blind.  
  
VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.  
  
The Man of pure and simple Heart  
Thro’ Life disdains a double part;  
He never needs the screen of Lies  
His inward Bosom to disguise.  
In vain malicious Tongues assail,  
Let Envy snarl, let Slander rail,  
From Virtue’s shield (secure from Wound)  
Their blunted venom’d shafts rebound.  
  
When you speak to a man, look on his eyes; when he speaks to thee, look on his mouth.

O blessed Season! lov’d by Saints and Sinners,  
For long Devotions, or for longer Dinners;  
More grateful still to those who deal in Books,  
Now not with Readers, but with Pastry-Cooks:  
Learn’d Works, despis’d by those to Merit blind,  
By these well weigh’d, their certain Value find.  
Bless’d Lot of Paper, falsely called Waste,  
To bear those Cates, which Authors seldom taste.  
  
Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure.  
  
A Flatterer never seems absurd:  
The Flatter’d always take his Word.

Neither praise nor dispraise, till seven Christmasses be over.

I know you Lawyers can, with Ease,  
Twist Words and Meanings as you please;  
That Language, by your Skill made pliant,  
Will bend to favour ev’ry Client;  
That ’tis the Fee directs the Sense  
To make out either Side’s Pretence:  
When you peruse the clearest Case,  
You see it with a double Face;  
For Scepticism’s your Profession;  
You hold there’s Doubt in all Expression.  
Hence is the Bar with Fees supply’d.  
Hence Eloquence takes either Side.  
Your Hand would have but paultry gleaning;  
Could every Man express his Meaning.  
Who dares presume to pen a Deed,  
Unless you previously are feed?  
’Tis drawn, and, to augment the Cost,  
In dull Prolixity engrost:  
And now we’re well secur’d by Law,  
  
’Till the next Brother find a Flaw.

aLEW. CHiON.  
AToLer 7, 1739.  
ous Heaner,  
ou may remember that in my first  
manack, published for the year 1733, I  
dicted the death of my dear friend  
tinen Leeds, Philomat, to happen that  
ir on the 17th day of October, 3 h. 29  
m. P.M. The good man, it seems, died  
tingty.  
But W. B. and A. B have  
  
continued to publich Almanacks in hisand mutiin being wa purae  
name ever since; asserting for some years i e ta in te i o o on­  
that he was still living; At length whengratulations, we remember that in the  
the truth could no longer be conccalede e of our infany as a people not  
from the world, they confess his death inon or ef ei wer en acos  
their Almanack for 1739, but pretend that the ocean to greet us, but upon its bosom  
he died not till last year, and that beforee or to or sors ear to e­  
his departure he had furnished them with pathise and arms to strike. How the  
calculations for ? years to come.Ah mye e e o te oe e of  
trionds, these are poor shifts and thin disoter a o o i i ta  
  
guises; of which indeed I should have  
taken little or no noties, if you had not  
at the same time accused me as a false  
predictor; an aspersion that the more af  
fects me, as my whole livelihood depends  
on a contrary character.  
  
But to put this matter beond diute to the Constitution, true to our mission,  
I shall acquaint the world with a faet, as an ee of te eon of io  
tange and surprisin as it is tu e  a eee o   
  
as follows, viz.  
n the ith instant, towards midnight  
as I sat in my little study writing this  
Preface, I fell fast asleep; and continued  
in that condition for some time, without  
dreaming anything, to my knowledge. On  
awaking, I found lying before me the fol­  
lowing letter, viz.  
Dear Friend SAuNders,  
My Respect for you continues even in  
this separate state, and I am grieved  
to see the aspersions thrown on you by the  
malevolence of avaricious publishers of  
Almanacks, who envy your success. They  
say your prediction of my death in 1733  
was false, and they pretend that I remained  
alive many years after. But I do hereby  
certify, that I did actually die at that time,  
precisely at the hour you mention&#x27;d, with  
a variation only of 5 min. 53 sec, which  
must be allow&#x27;d to be no great matter in  
such cases. And I do further declare that  
I furnish&#x27;d them with no calculations of  
the planets motions, &amp;e seven years after  
my death, as they are pleased to give out:  
so that the stuff they publish as an Alma  
nack in my name is no more mine than  
&#x27;tis yours.  
You will wonder perhaps, how this pa­  
per comes written on your table. You  
inust know that no separate spirits are  
under any confinement till after the final  
settlement of all accounts. In the mean  
time we wander where we please, visit our  
old friends, observe their actions, enter  
sometimes into their imaginations, and  
give them hints waking or sleeping that  
may be of advantage to them. Find­  
ing you asleep, I enter&#x27;d your left nostril,  
ascended into your brain, found out where  
the ends of those nerves were fastened  
that move your right hand and fingers, by  
the help of which I am now writing un­  
known to you; but when you open your  
eyes, you will find that the hand written  
is mine, tho wrote with yours.  
The people of this infidel age, perhaps,  
will hardly believe this story. But you  
mey give them these three signs by which  
they shall be convinced of the truth of it.  
About the middle of June next, J  
J.n, Philomat shall be openly  
ciled to the Church of Rome, and give all  
  
his goods and chattels to the chappel, be  
ing perverted by a certain country school  
  
  
master.- On the 7th of September follow.  
s neighbours:And about the same  
time W. B. and A. B. will publish another  
Almanack in my name, in spight of truth  
and common sense.  
As I can see much clearer in futurity,  
since I got free from the dark prison of  
flesh, in which I was continually molested  
and almest biisled ed ao oe  
and almost blinded with fogs arising from  
tiff, and the smoke of burnt drams; I shall  
e eo ee o e oe  
in hindness to you, frequently give you  
 e eoeo   
information of things to come, for the im  
provement of your Almanack: being,  
Dear Dick, Your Affectionate Friend,  
T. LEEDS.  
For my own part I am convinced that  
the above letter is genuine. If the reader  
doubts of it, let him carefully observe  
the three stgrs; and if they do not ac­  
tually come to pass, believe as he pleases.  
I am his humble Friend,  
R. SAUNDERS

If gold bo the standard for them, and  
they must adjus* their prices by it. surely  
goods and provisions ought to be cheaper  
now than they were a wil k Ihe  
fact is that our merchants have become  
as greedy and unscrupulous speculators

** OCTOBER 7, 1739.  
  
**CourRTEOUS READER : You may remember  
that in my first Almanack. published for the year  
1733, I predicted the death of my dear friend,  
Titan Leeds, Philomat, to happen that year on  
the 17th day of October, 3 h. 29m. P. M. The  
good man, it seems, died accordingly. But W. B.  
and A. B. [*] have continued to publish Alma-  
nacks in his name ever since ; asserting for some  
years that he was still living. At length when  
the truth could no longer be concealed from the  
world, they confessed his death in their Almanack  
for 1739, but pretended that he died not till last  
year, and that before his departure he had  
furnished them with calculations for 7 years to  
come.—Ah, my friends, these are poor shifts and  
thin disguises; of which indeed I should have  
taken little or no notice, if you had not at the  
same time accused me as a false predictor; an  
aspersion that the more affects me as my whole  
livelyhood depends on a contrary character.  
  
** But to put this matter beyond dispute, I shali  
acquaint the world with a fact, as strange and  
surprising as it is true; being as follows, viz :  
  
**On the 4th instant, toward midnight, as I sat  
in my little study writing this Preface, I fell fast  
asleep ; and continued in that condition for some  
time, without dreaming any thing, to my knowl-  
edge. On awaking I found lying before me the  
following, viz.—  
  
*** DEAR FRIEND SAUNDERS: My respect for  
you continues even in this separate state ; and I  
am griev&#x27;d to see the aspersions thrown on you  
by the malevolence of avaricious publishers of  
Almanacks, who envy your success. They say  
your prediction of my death in 1733 was false,  
and they pretend that I remained alive many  
years after. But I do hereby certify that I did  
actually die at that time, precisely at the hour  
you mention’d, with a variation only of 5 min. 53°  
sec., which must be allow&#x27;d to be no great matter  
in such cases. And I do further declare that I  
furnish’d them with no calculations of the planets’  
motions, etc., seven years after my death, as they  
are pleased to give out: so that the stuff they  
publish as an Almanack in my name is no more  
mine than ’tis yours  
  
*** You will wonder, perhaps, how this paper  
comes written on your table. You must know  
that no separate spirits are under any confine-  
ment till after the final settlement of all accounts.  
In the mean time we wander where we please,  
visit our old friends, observe their actions, enter  
sometimes into their imaginations, and give them  
hints waking or sleeping that may be of -advan-  
tage tothem. Finding you asleep, I enter’d your

left nostril, ascended into your brain, found out  
where the ends of those nerves were fastened that  
move your right hand and fingers, by the help of  
which I am now writing unknown to you; but  
when you open your eyes you will see that the  
hand written is mine, tho’ wrote with yours.  
  
‘** The people of this infidel age, perhaps, will  
hardly believe this story. But you may give them  
these three signs by which they shall be con-  
vinced of the truth of it.—About the middle of  
June next, J. J. n,* Philomat, shall be  
openly reconciled to the Church of Rome, and  
give all his goods and chattels to the chappel,  
being perverted by acertain country schoolmaster.  
On the 7th of September following my old Friend  
W.B t shall be sober g hours, to the astonish-  
ment of all his neighbours :—And about the same  
time W. B. and A. B. will publish another Alma-  
nack in my name, in spight of truth and common  
sense.  
  
*** As I can see much clearer into futurity, since  
I got free from the dark prison of flesh, in which  
I was continually molested and almost blinded  
with fogs arising from tiff, and the smoke of  
burnt drams ; I shall in kindness to you, frequent-  
ly give you information of things to come, for the  
improvement of your Almanack: being, Dear  
Dick, Your Affectionate Friend,  
  
  
  
  
  
““*T, Leeps ”  
  
‘* For my own part, I am convinced that the  
above letter is genuine. If the reader doubts of  
it, let him carefully observe the three signs ; and  
if they do not actually come to pass, believe as he  
pleases. I am his humble Friend,  
  
“*R. SAUNDERS.”

Hence eloquence takes either side
