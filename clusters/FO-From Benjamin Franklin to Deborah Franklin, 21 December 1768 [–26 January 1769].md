g after me. As you ask me, I can assure you, that I do really intend, God willing, to return in the Summer, and that as soon as possible after seeing and settling Matters with Mr. Foxcroft, whom I expect [in] April or May. I am glad that you find so much reason to be satisfy’d with Mr. Bache. I hope all will prove for the best. Capt. Falkener has been arrived at Plymouth some time, but the Winds being contrary could get no farther, so I have not yet received the Apples, Meal, &amp;c. and fear they will be spoilt. I send with this, some of the new kind of Oats much admir’d here to make Oatmeal of, and for other Uses, as being free from Huskes; and some Swiss Barley 6 Rows to an Ear: perhaps our Friends may like to try them, and you may distribute the Seed among them. Give some to Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Thomson, Mr. Bartram, our Son, and others. I cannot comprehend how so very sluggish a Creature as Ben Mecom is grown, can maintain in Philadelphia so large a Family. I hope they do not hang upon you: for really as we grow old and must grow more helpless, we shall find we have nothing to spare. I hope the Cold you complain of in two of your Letters went off without any ill Consequences. We are, as you observe, blest with a great Share of Health considering our Years now 63. For my own part, I think of late that my Constitution rather mends; I have had but one Touch of the Gout, and that a light one, since I left you; it was just after my Arrival here, so that this is the 4th Winter I have been free. Walking a great deal tires me less than it used to do. I feel stronger and more active. Yet I would not have you think that I fancy I shall grow young again. I know that Men of my Bulk often fail suddenly: I know that according to the Course of Nature I cannot at most continue much longer, and that the living even of another Day is uncertain. I therefore now form no Scheme but such as are of immediate Execution; indulging myself in no future Prospect except one, that of returning to Philadelphia, there to spend the Evening of Life with my Friends and Family. Adieu my dear Debby: I am, as ever, your affectionate Husband

MY Dean Our I do As you ask med  
can assure you that I do really intend, God  
willing, to return in the summer, and that as  
soon as poseible after settling matters with Mr  
Foxcroft, whom I expect in April or May. I  
am glad that you find so much reason to be  
satisfied with Mr. Bache. I hope all will prove  
for the best, Capta Falconer has been arrived at  
Plymouth some time, but, the winds being con­  
trary, could get no further; so I have not yet  
received the apples, meal, &amp;c., and fear they  
will be spoiled. I send with this some of the  
new kind of oats much admired here to make  
oatmeal of and for other uses as being free  
from husks; and some Swiss barley, six rows  
to an ear. Perhaps our friends may like to try  
them, and you may distribute the seed among  
them Give some to Mr Roberts, Mr Ithoades  
Mr. Thomson, Mr. Bartram, our son, and others  
I hope the cold you complain of in two of your  
lefters went off without any ill consequences  
We are, as you observe, blest with a  
great share of health, considering our  
years, now sixty-three. For my own  
bart oI think of late that my con­  
stitution rather mends. I have had but one  
touch of the gout, and that a light one, since I  
left you. It was just after my arrival here  
Walking a great deal tires me less than it used  
to do. I feel stronger and more active; yet I  
would not have you think that I fancy I shall  
grow young again. I know that men of my  
bulk often fail suddenly. I know that, accord­  
ing to the course of nature, I cannot, at most  
continue much longer, and that the living.  
even of another day, is uncertain. I therefore  
form no schemes but such as are for immediate  
execution, indulging myself in no future pros  
pect except one--that of returning to Phila  
delphia, there to spend the evening of life with  
my friends and family.   
Adieu, my dear Debby. I am, as ever, your
