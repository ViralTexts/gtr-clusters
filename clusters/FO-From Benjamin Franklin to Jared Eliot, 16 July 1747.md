Philada. July 16. 1747  
I receiv’d your Favour of the 4th Instant. I ought before this Time to have acknowledg’d the Receipt of the Book, which came very safe and in good Order, to hand. We have many Oil Mills in this Province, it being a great Country for Flax. Linseed Oil may now be bought for 3s. per Gallon; sometimes for 2s. 6d: But at New York I have been told it generally holds up at about 8s. Of this you can easily be satisfy’d, it being your Neighbour Government. In your last, you enquir’d about the kind of Land from which our Hemp is rais’d. I am told it must be very rich Land; sometimes they use drain’d Swamps and bank’d Meadows: But the greatest Part of our Hemp is brought from Canistogo which is a large and very rich Tract [of Land] 70 Miles [west] from this City on the Banks of Sasquehanah a large fresh Water River. It is brought down in Waggons. If you should send any of your Steel Saws here for Sale, I should not be wanting where my Recommendation might be of Service. We have had as wet a Summer as has been known here these Thirty Years, so that it was with Difficulty our People got in their Harvest. In some Parts of the Country a great Deal of Hay has been lost, and some Corn mildew’d: but in general the Harvest has been very great. The two preceding Summers (particularly the last,) were excessively dry. I think with you, it might be of Advantage to know what the Seasons are in the Several Parts of the Country. One’s Curiosity in some philosophical Points might also be gratified by it. We have frequently along this North American Coast, Storms from the N East, which blow violently sometimes 3 or 4 Days. Of these I have had a very singular Opinion some years, viz. that tho’ the Coarse of the Wind is from NE. to S.W. yet the Course of the Storm is from S.W to NE. i.e. the Air is in violent Motion in Virginia before it moves in Connecticut, and in Connecticut before it moves at Cape Sable, &amp;c. My Reasons for this Opinion (if the like have not occur’d to you) I will give in my next. I thank you for the curious Facts you have communicated to me relating to Springs. I think with you, that most Springs arise from Rains, Dews, or Ponds, &amp;c. on higher Grounds: Yet possibly some that break out near the Tops of high Hollow Mountains, may proceed from the Abyss, or from Water in the Caverns of the Earth, rarified by its internal Heat, and raised in Vapour, ’till the cold Region near the Tops of such Mountains condense the Vapour into Water [again?] which comes forth in Springs and runs down on the outside of the Mountain, as it ascended on the [Inside?]. There is said to be a large Spring near the Top of Teneriffe; and that Mountain was formerly a Volcano, consequently hollow within. Such Springs, if such there be, may properly be call’d Springs of distill’d Water. Now I mention Mountains it occurs to tell you, that the great Apalachian Mountains, which run from York River back of these Colonies to the Bay of Mexico, show in many Places near the highest Parts of them, Strata of Sea Shells, in some Places the Marks of them are in the solid Rocks. ’Tis certainly the Wreck of a World we live on! We have Specimens of those Sea shell Rocks broken off near the Tops of those Mountains, brought and deposited in our Library as Curiosities. If you have not seen the like, I’ll send you a Piece. Farther, about Mountains (for Ideas will string themselves like Ropes of Onions) when I was once riding in your Country, Mr. Walker show’d me at a Distance the Bluff Side or End of a Mountain, which appeared striped from top to Bottom, and told me the Stone or Rock of that Mountain was divided by Nature into Pillars; of this I should be glad to have a particular Account from you. I think I was somewhere near Newhaven when I saw it. You made some Mistake when you intended to favour me with some of the new valuable Grass Seed (I think you call’d it Hurd Seed) for what you gave me is grown up, and proves meer Timothy; so I suppose you took it out of a wrong Paper or Parcel.  
I wish your new Law may have the good Effect expected from it, in extricating your Government from the heavy Debt this War has oblig’d them to contract. I am too little acquainted with your particular Circumstances to Judge of the Prudence of such a Law for your Colony with any Degree of Exactness. But to a Friend one may hazard one’s Notions right or wrong. And as you are pleas’d to desire my Thoughts, you shall have ’em and welcome. I wish they were better. First, I imagine that the Five Per Cent Duty on Goods imported from your Neighbouring Governments, tho’ paid at first Hand by the Importer, will not upon the whole come out of his Pocket, but be paid in Fact by the Consumer: For the Importer will be sure to sell his Goods as much dearer as to reimburse himself: So that it is only another Mode of Taxing your own People, tho’ perhaps meant to raise Money on your Neighbours. Yet if you can make some of the Goods, heretofore imported, among yourselves, the advanc’d Price of 5 percent may encourage your own Manufacture [torn] and in time make the Importation of such Articles unnecessary, which will be an Advantage. Secondly, I imagine the Law will be difficult to execute, require many Officers to prevent Smugling, in so extended a Coast as yours; and the Charge considerable: And if Smugling is not prevented, the fair Trader will be undersold and ruined. If the Officers are many and busy, there will arise Numbers of vexatious Lawsuits, and Dissensions among your People. Quere whether the Advantages will overballance. Thirdly, if there is any Part of your Produce that you can well spare and would desire to have taken off by your Neighbours in Exchange for something you more want, perhaps they, taking Offence at your selfish Law, may in Return lay such heavy Duties or Discouragements on that Article, as to leave it a Drug on your Hands. As to the Duty on transporting Lumber, (unless in Connecticut Bottoms to the West Indies) I suppose the Design is to raise the Price of such Lumber on your Neighbours, and throw that advanc’d Price into your Treasury: But may not your Neighbours supply themselves elsewhere; or if Numbers of your People have Lumber to dispose of, and want Goods from, or have Debts to, pay to your Neighbours, will they not, (unless you employ Numbers of Officers, to watch all your Creeks, and Landings) run their Lumber, and so defeat the Law; or if the Law is strictly executed, and the Duty discourage the Transportation to your Neighbours, will not all your People that want to dispose of Lumber, be laid at the Mercy of those few Merchants that send it to the W. Indies, who will buy it at their own Price, and make such Pay for it as they think proper. If I had seen the Law, and heard the Reasons that are given for making it, I might have judg’d and talk’d of it more to the purpose. At present I shoot my Bolt pretty much in the Dark: But you can excuse, and make proper Allowances. My best Respects to good Madam Elliot and your Sons; and if it falls in your Way, my Service to the kind hospitable People near the River, whose Name I am sorry I’ve forgot. I am, Dear Sir, [with] the utmost Regard, Your obliged humble Servant

2. Puriapevenia, Juty 16, 1747.  
Dear Sir,  
  
I received your favor of the 4th instant. I ought be-  
fore this time to have acknowledged the receipt of the book,  
which came very safe and in good order, to hand. We  
have many oil mills in this Province, it being a great coun-  
try for Flax. Linseed oil may now be bought for 3s. per  
gallon ; sometimes for 2s. 6d.: But at New York I have  
been told it generally holds up at about 8s. of this you can  
easily be satisfied, it being your neighbour government. In  
your last, you enquired about the kind of land from which  
our hemp is raised. [am told it must be very rich land;  
sometimes they use drained swamps and banked meadows :  
but the greatest part of our hempis brought from Canistego,  
which is a large and very rich tract of land 70 miles north  
from this city, on the banks of the Susquehanah a large  
fresh water river. It is brought down in waggons. If you  
should send any of your steel saws here for sale, I should  
not be wanting where my recommendation might be of ser-  
vice. We have had as wet a summer as has been known

the wind is from N. E. to S. W. yet the course of the storm  
is from the S. W. to N. E. i. e. the air is in violent motion  
in Virginia before it moves in Conuecticut, and at Connect-  
icut before it moves at Cape Sable, &amp;c. My reasons for this  
opinion, (if the like has not occurred to you,) I will give in  
my next. I thank you for the curious facts you have com-  
municated to me relating tosprings. 1 think with you, that  
most springs arise from rains, dews, or ponds, &amp;c. on higher  
grounds: Yet possibly some that break out near the tops of  
high hollow mountains, may proceed from the abyss, or from  
water in the caverns of the earth, rarified by its internal  
heat, and raised in vapour, till the cold region near the top  
of such mountains condense the vapour into water again,  
which comes forth in springs and runs down on the outside  
of the mountain, as it ascended from the inside. There is  
said to be a large spring near the top of Teneriffe ; and that  
mountain was formerly a Volcano, consequently hollow  
within. Such springs, if such there be, may properly be  
called springs of distilled water. Now I mention mountains,  
it occurs to tell you, that the great Apalachian mountains,  
which run from York River back of these Colonies to the  
Bay of Mexico, show in many places near the highest parts  
of them, strata of sea shells, in some places the marks of  
them are in the solid rocks. ”Tis certainly a Wreck of a  
world we live on! We have specimens of these sea shell  
rocks broken off near the tops of those mountains, brought  
and deposited in our library as curiosities. If you have  
not seen the like, I&#x27;ll send you a piece. Farther about  
mountains (for ideas will string themselves like ropes of on-  
ions) when I was once riding in your country, Mr. Walker  
showed me ata distance the bluff, side or end of a mountain,  
which appeared striped from top to bottom, and told me the  
stone or rock of that mountain was divided by nature into  
pillars ;* of this I should be glad to have a particular ac-  
count from you. I think I was somewhere near New Ha-

Original Letters of Dr. Franklin. 363  
  
I wish your new law may have the good effect expected  
from it, in extricating your government from the heavy  
debt this war has obliged them to contract. I am too little  
acquainted with your particular circumstances to judge of  
the prudence of such alaw for your colony with any de-  
gree ofexactness. But to a friend one may hazard one’s  
notions right or wrong. And as you are pleased to desire my  
thoughts, you shall have them in welcome. I wish they  
were better. First, 1 imagine that the five per cent duty on  
goods imported from your neighbouring governments, though  
paid at first hand by the importer, will not upon the whole  
come out of his pocket, but be paid in fact by the consumer :  
For the importer will be sure to sell his goods as much dear-  
er as to reimburse himself: So that it is only another mode  
of taxing your own people, though perhaps meant to raise  
money on your neighbours. Yet if you can make some of  
the goods, heretofore imported, among yourselves, the ad-  
vanced price of five per cent may encourage your own man-  
ufacture and in time make the importation of such articles  
unnecessary, which will be an advantage. Secondly, I im-  
agine the law will be difficult to execute, require many offi-  
cers to prevent smuggling in so extended a coast as yours;  
and the charge considerable: And if smuggling is not pre-  
vented, the fair trader will be undersold and ruined. If the  
officers are many and busy, there will arise numbers of vex-  
atious law suits, and dissensions among your people. Quere,  
whether the advantages will overbalance. Thirdly, if there  
is any part of your produce that you can well spare and  
_ would desire to have taken off by your neighbours in ex-  
  
change for something you more want, perhaps they, taking  
offence at your selfish law, may in return lay such heavy  
duties or discouragements on thai article, as to leave it a  
drug on your hands. As to the duty on transporting lumber,  
(unless in Connecticut bottoms, to the West Indies,) I sup-  
pose the design is to raise the price of such lumber on your  
neighbours and throw that advanced price into your treasu-  
ry: But may not your neighbours supply themselves else-  
where ; or if numbers of your people have Jumber to dis-  
pose of, and want goods from, or have debts to pay, to your  
neighbours, will they not, (unless you employ numbers of of-  
ficers, to watch all your creeks, and landings) run their lum-
