London, Nov. 3. 1772  
I received yours of Aug. 24. by Capt. Vanderhorst, to whom I should willingly have shown any Civilities in my Power, but I being gouty of late seldom go into the City, and he has not called on me since he delivered your Letter. I am sorry you talk of leaving off your Business with a View of getting some Post. It is so difficult a matter to obtain any thing of the kind, that I think to leave a good Trade in hopes of an Office, is quitting a Certainty for an Uncertainty, and losing Substance for Shadow. I have known so many here dangling and soliciting Years for Places, till they were reduc’d to the lowest Poverty and Distress, that I cannot but pity a Man who begins to turn his Thoughts that way: The Proverb says, He who has a Trade has an Office of Profit and Honour; because he does not hold it during any other Man’s Pleasure, and it affords him honest Subsistence with Independence. I hope therefore you will alter your mind and go on with your Business. I assure you it is not in my Power to procure you that Post you mention or any other, whatever my Wishes may be for your Prosperity. I am now thought here too much an American to have any Interest of the kind.  
You have done me Honour in giving a Son my Name. I wish he may live to be an Honour and Comfort to you. With Compliments to Mrs. Timothy, I am ever, Dear Sir, Your faithful and most obedient Servant

“LonpDOoN, Nov. 3, 1772.  
  
* DEAR Str: I received yours of Aug. 24,  
by Capt. Vanderhorst, to whom I should wil-  
lingly have shown any civilities in my power,  
but I being gouty of late, seldom go into the  
City, and he has not called on me since he  
delivered your letter. I am sorry you talk of  
leaving off your business with a view of get-  
ting some post. It is so difficult a matter to  
obtain anything of the kind, that I think to  
leave a good trade in hopes of an office, is  
quitting a certainty for an uncertainty, and  
losing substance for shadow. I have known  
so many here dangling and soliciting years  
for places, till they were reduced to the low-  
est poverty and distress, that I cannot but  
pity a man who begins to turn his thoughts  
that way. The proverb says, He who has a  
trade has an office of profit and honor; because  
he does not hold it during any other man’s  
pleasure, and it affords him honest subsist-  
ence with independence. I hope therefore  
you will alter your mind and go on with your  
business. I assure you it is not in my power  
to procure you that post you mention or any  
other, whatever my wishes may be for your  
prosperity. I am now thought here too much  
an American to have any interest of the  
kind.  
  
* You have done me honour in giving a  
Son my name. _I wish he may live to be an  
honour and comfort to you.  
  
“With compliments to Mrs. Timothy, I  
am ever, dear Sir,  
  
“ Your faithful &amp; most obedient Servant,
