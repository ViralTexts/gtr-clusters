From the N.Y. Statesman, of 1821.  
  
The following beautiful stanzas were handed to us by a friend a few days since. He did not know the author; nor do we recollect ever to have read them before. The note of the transcriber remarked that these lines are the production of no ordinary mind, to which every one will assent. The picture was undoubtedly suggested by one of the finest passages in Hamlet; but the thoughts are happily conceived and elegantly expressed.  
  
BEHOLD this ruin!—&#x27;twas a scull,    
Once of athereal spirit full!  
That narrow cell was life&#x27;s retreat!  
This space was thought&#x27;s mysterious seat!  
What beauteous pictures fill&#x27;d this spot?  
What dreams of pleasure long forgot?  
Not love, nor joy, nor hope, nor fear,  
Has left one trace or record here!  
  
Beneath this mouldering canopy  
Once shone the bright and busy eye—  
But start not at the dismal void!  
If social love that eye employ&#x27;d,  
If with no lawless fire it gleam&#x27;d,  
But through the dew of kindness beam&#x27;d,  
That eye shall be forever bright,  
When stars and suns have lost their light!  
  
Here, in this silent cavern, hung  
That ready, swift, and tuneful tongue,  
If falsehood&#x27;s honey it disdain&#x27;d,  
And where it could not praise, was chain&#x27;d  
If bold in virtue&#x27;s cause it spoke,  
Yet gentle concord never broke,  
That tuneful tongue shall plead for thee,  
When death unveils eternity!  
  
Say, did these fingers delve the mine,  
Or with its envied rubies shine?  
To hew the rock or wear the gem,  
Can nothing now avail to them:  
But if the page of truth they sought,  
Or comfort to the mourner brought,  
These hands a richer meed shall claim  
Than all that waits on wealth or fame.  
  
Avails it whether, bare or shod,  
These feet the path of duty trod?  
If from the bowers of joy they fled,  
To soothe affliction&#x27;s humble bed.  
If grandeur&#x27;s guilty bribe they spurn&#x27;d,  
And home to virtue&#x27;s lap return&#x27;d,  
These feet with angel&#x27;s wings shall vie,  
And tread the palace of the sky!

FROM THE SEW-TORK STATESMAN.  
The following beautiful stanzas were hand­  
ed to us bv o friend a few days since. He did  
not know the author, nor do we recollect ever  
to have read them before. The note of the  
transcriber remarked that these lines arc the  
production of no ordinary mind, to which eve­  
ry one will readily assent. The picture was  
undoubtedly suggested by one of the finest  
passages in Ilainlet: but the thoughts are hap­  
pily conceived and elegantly expressed.  
A FHAGMENT  
Found in a Skeleton Case.  
Behold this ruin! ’Twas a scull,  
Once of ethereal spirit full!  
That narrow cell was life’s retreat!  
This space was Thought’s mysterious seat !  
What beauteous pictures filled this sj ;&gt;t !  
What dreams of pleasure long forgot!  
Not Love, nor Joy, nor Hope, nor Fear,  
Has left one trace or record here.  
Beneath this mouldering canopy  
Once shone the bright and busy eye—  
But start not at the dismal void!  
If social love that eye employed,  
If with no lawless fire it gleam’d,  
But through the dew of kindness beam’d,  
That eye shall be forever bright,  
When stars and suns nave lost their light!  
Here in tins silent cavern, hung  
That, ready, swift, and tuneful tongue,  
if falsehood&#x27;s honey it disdain’d,  
And where it could not praise, was chain’d,  
If bold in virtue’s cause it spoke,  
Yet gentle concord never broke :  
That tuneful tongue shall plead for thee,  
When death unveils eternity.  
Say, did these fingers delve the mine,  
Qr, with its envied rubies shine ?  
To hew the rock or wear the gem,  
£an nothing now avail to them.  
But if the page of truth they sought,  
Or comfort to the mourner brought,  
Thcsi hands a richer mead shall claim,  
Than all that waits on wealth or fame.  
Avails it whether bare or shod,  
These feet the path of duty trod ?  
If from the bowers of joy they Hed,  
To soothe affliction’s humble bed.  
If grandeur’s guilty bribe they spurn’d,  
And home to virtue’s lap return’d;

## [TO A SKELETON. [The following verses were published anonypiously in the London "Morning Chronicle" in 1827. Nothwithstanding the offer of a reward of fifty guineas, the authors name has remained a secret until nearly sixty years had passed, when it was learned that the lines were written by Robert Philip, of Gormyre Cottage, Scotland. Toward the end of the year 1826 he wrote the verses while watching for body-snatchers in the parish church-yard of Torphichen, where, during the repairing of the church, the unearthing of a skeleton suggested the subject. The verses were shown to Dr John Alford, who procured a copy, and either by accident or intention dropped a copy in the Royal College of Surgeons, where they were found.]](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/149738198)
