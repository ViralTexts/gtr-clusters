From the N.Y. Statesman, of 1821.  
  
The following beautiful stanzas were handed to us by a friend a few days since. He did not know the author; nor do we recollect ever to have read them before. The note of the transcriber remarked that these lines are the production of no ordinary mind, to which every one will assent. The picture was undoubtedly suggested by one of the finest passages in Hamlet; but the thoughts are happily conceived and elegantly expressed.  
  
BEHOLD this ruin!—&#x27;twas a scull,    
Once of athereal spirit full!  
That narrow cell was life&#x27;s retreat!  
This space was thought&#x27;s mysterious seat!  
What beauteous pictures fill&#x27;d this spot?  
What dreams of pleasure long forgot?  
Not love, nor joy, nor hope, nor fear,  
Has left one trace or record here!  
  
Beneath this mouldering canopy  
Once shone the bright and busy eye—  
But start not at the dismal void!  
If social love that eye employ&#x27;d,  
If with no lawless fire it gleam&#x27;d,  
But through the dew of kindness beam&#x27;d,  
That eye shall be forever bright,  
When stars and suns have lost their light!  
  
Here, in this silent cavern, hung  
That ready, swift, and tuneful tongue,  
If falsehood&#x27;s honey it disdain&#x27;d,  
And where it could not praise, was chain&#x27;d  
If bold in virtue&#x27;s cause it spoke,  
Yet gentle concord never broke,  
That tuneful tongue shall plead for thee,  
When death unveils eternity!  
  
Say, did these fingers delve the mine,  
Or with its envied rubies shine?  
To hew the rock or wear the gem,  
Can nothing now avail to them:  
But if the page of truth they sought,  
Or comfort to the mourner brought,  
These hands a richer meed shall claim  
Than all that waits on wealth or fame.  
  
Avails it whether, bare or shod,  
These feet the path of duty trod?  
If from the bowers of joy they fled,  
To soothe affliction&#x27;s humble bed.  
If grandeur&#x27;s guilty bribe they spurn&#x27;d,  
And home to virtue&#x27;s lap return&#x27;d,  
These feet with angel&#x27;s wings shall vie,  
And tread the palace of the sky!

.  
FROM THE SEW-TORK STATESMAN.  
The following beautiful stanzas were hand­  
ed to us bv o friend a few days since. He did  
not know the author, nor do we recollect ever  
to have read them before. The note of the  
transcriber remarked that these lines arc the  
production of no ordinary mind, to which eve­  
ry one will readily assent. The picture was  
undoubtedly suggested by one of the finest  
passages in Ilainlet: but the thoughts are hap­  
pily conceived and elegantly expressed.  
A FHAGMENT  
Found in a Skeleton Case.  
Behold this ruin! ’Twas a scull,  
Once of ethereal spirit full!  
That narrow cell was life’s retreat!  
This space was Thought’s mysterious seat !  
What beauteous pictures filled this sj ;&gt;t !  
What dreams of pleasure long forgot!  
Not Love, nor Joy, nor Hope, nor Fear,  
Has left one trace or record here.  
Beneath this mouldering canopy  
Once shone the bright and busy eye—  
But start not at the dismal void!  
If social love that eye employed,  
If with no lawless fire it gleam’d,  
But through the dew of kindness beam’d,  
That eye shall be forever bright,  
When stars and suns nave lost their light!  
Here in tins silent cavern, hung  
That, ready, swift, and tuneful tongue,  
if falsehood&#x27;s honey it disdain’d,  
And where it could not praise, was chain’d,  
If bold in virtue’s cause it spoke,  
Yet gentle concord never broke :  
That tuneful tongue shall plead for thee,  
When death unveils eternity.

Suce forty years ago the following  
poem waa found in the London Morning  
Chronicle. Every effort was vainly made  
to discover the author, even to the offer­  
ing a reward of fifty guineas. All that  
ever transpired was that the poem, in a  
fair, clerkly hand, was found near a skele­  
ton of remarkable symmetry of form in  
the Museum of the lioyal College of Sur.  
geon Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London, and that  
tke Curator of the Museum had sent them  
to the editor of the Morning Chronicle.

I&#x27;OOK HUMANITY.  
More than half a century ago, the fol­  
lowing lines were found in the Royal  
College of Surgeons, London, beside&quot; a  
skeleton, remarkable tur its svniinetrv  
of form. They were subsequently j.ub­  
lislieil in the London Morning (.&#x27;hroni­  
cle, and a vain effort made to ascertain  
the author, even to offering a reward of  
fifty guineas:  
Behold this ruin ! Twas a skull  
Once of ethereal spirit lull.  
This narrow evil w:?s life&#x27;s retreat :  
This space was thought&#x27;s mysterious seat.  
What beauteous visions tilled this spot  
With dreams of pleasure long forgot !  
, Not hope, not joy, not love, not fear,  
Have left one trace of record here.

Once shone the bright and busy eye ;  
I Jut start not at the dismal void !  
If social love t-hat eye employed ;  
If with no lawless fire it gleamed  
But through the dews of kindness :

That eye shall be forever bright.  
When suu and stars are sunk in night.  
Within this hollow cavern rung

Some forty years ago the following poem was  
found in the London Morning Chronicle. Every  
effort was vainly made to discover the author,  
even to the offering of a reward of fifty guineas.  
All that ever transpired was that the poem, in a  
fair clerkly hand, was found near a skeleton of  
remarkable symmetry of form in the museum of  
the Royal College of Surgeons, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn,  
London, and that the curator of the museum sent  
it to the Morning Chronicle  
Behold this ruin! &#x27;Twas a skull

THE SKELETON.  
Exactly forty years ago, the London &quot; Morn  
  
ing Chronicle&quot; published a poem entitled  
&quot;Lines on a Skeleton,&quot; which excited much  
attention. Every effort, even to offering a re­  
ward of fifty guineas, was vainly mado to dis-  
covtr the author. All that ever transpired  
was, that the poem, in a fair, clerkly hand,  
was found near.a skeleton of remarkable sym­  
metry of form In the Museum of the Royal  
College or Surgeons, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London,  
and that the Curator of the Museum had sent  
It to the &#x27; Morning Chronicle.&quot;

Lines to a Skeleton.  
[Exactly sixtv yearsgago the London Morn­  
utg Chronicle published a poem entitled &quot;Lines  
on a Skeleton,&quot; which excited much attention.  
Every effort, even to the offeung of a reward  
of fifty guineas, was vainly made to discover  
its author. All that ever transpired was that  
the ooem, in a fair clerkly hand, was found  
near a skeleton of remarkable beauty ol form  
the Museum of the Royal College of Surge­  
ons&#x27;, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London, and that the  
Curstor of the Museum had sent them to Mr.  
Pern, editor and proprietor of the Morrang

OUK PASSENGER.  
THE CAPTAIN&#x27;S STORY.  
It was a lovely autumn afternoon to­  
ward the cbse of September, when we  
weighed anchor, and sailed out of the  
nver Meisey, bound for Melbourne. We  
had a good shipJanet&#x27;s Prideloaded  
with miscellaneous articles. On board  
were fourteen passengers, and take them  
all in all, a pleasanter lot I never steered  
across the stormy seas.  
There were three old gentlemen, who  
were going out to share their fortunes,  
come what might, and which, poor old  
souls, they seemed to think tashioned in  
the brightest colors, long befoie the  
English coast was out of sight.  
Then there was a solitary old getle­  
man, who, judging from the general tone  
of his conversation, was seeking the new  
world for the the ostensible purpose ot  
finding fault will it.  
There were two young maTried  
couples,  
all full of hone and activity, bent upon  
making anew home far away from their  
native land.  
There were also a very jolly elderly  
brother and sister, neither oi whom had  
ever entered into the bonds of matri­  
mony, but instead, had stuck by each  
other through life.  
There were three old Australian set­  
tlers, who had bpen over to have a peep  
at the old country, and who were now re­  
turning to the &quot;land which to them,  
through long communion, had become  
the dearest of all others&quot;Home, sweet  
ho-ue!&quot;  
Lastly, though not least, there was a  
solitary passenger, who soon became the  
pet of all on board. He was a man of  
about eight-and-twenty years of age,  
possessing a very clear complexion, a  
very handsome, long-flowinc beard, and  
a very silky mustache.  
His name was Reginald Moore. His  
given reason for taking this sea voyage  
was the delicate state of his health.  
There was not the least doubt that the  
poor fellow&#x27;s chest was considerably af­  
fected, though his voice, charmingly  
sweet, was one of the weakest I ever re­  
member hearing and it had a certain  
hollowness in its sound that in my mind  
is invariably associated with that terrible  
disease commonly termed consumption.  
He always wore a thick muffler round  
his neck to protect his throat and chest.  
In all my experienceand it has been  
pretty wideI never knew any one with  
so many friends, and such undivided es­  
teem, in so short a space of time, as Regi­  
nald Moore. TLeie was not, I believe, a  
sailor on board who did not entertain the  
warmest possible liking for him.  
As for the passengers, they never  
seemed so happy as when listening to  
his amusing anecdotes, of which he seemed  
to possess an inexhaustible store. And  
this delicate young English paragon of  
passengers had made his conquest over  
all our hearts before we had been three  
weeks at sea.  
He was, too, such a clever fellow with  
his hands. He could cut and shape you  
anything out of apiece of wood, from an  
oyster to a elephant and at making mod­  
els of ships, I never met his equal. He  
was, besides, such a kind and considerate  
fellow toward his fellow-passengers.  
&quot;When the three elderly gentlemen, who  
imagined their fortunes made, were af­  
flicted with sea-sickness, he was the first  
to come forward and help them about  
while they slowly recovered. He would  
insist upon their taking his arm, weak as  
he was himself, and he woula lead them  
about on the deck with a firmness that  
spoke volumes in favor of his &quot;sea legs.&#x27;  
I do not remember any voyage passing  
so quickly as the one when the pleasant  
pas^enge- was on board. I could, with  
infinite pleasure, make a long pause at  
this juncture in the thread of my story,  
to dwell upon the pleasant memories I  
still retain of Reginald Moore.  
We were within a week&#x27;s sail of Mel­  
bourne- Reginald Moore had all butupon  
completed a model of the Janet&#x27;s Pride,  
which he proposed presenting to me the  
nigrht before we landed.  
Now the work at this model princi­  
pally on deck, and strangely enough, he  
had chosen for a work table one of the  
empty water-casks that stood on deck,  
abaft, and under the shelter of the bul­  
warks.  
While he worked through the day, you  
were sure to see him surrounded by some  
of the passengers or sailors. The amount  
of industry he displayed was trully won­  
derful, for he was invariably at work in  
the early morning, long before any of the  
other passengers dreamt ot turning out  
of their snug berths.  
As I have already stated, we were but  
six days&#x27; sail fromMelbourae. For the first  
time in our experience of him, the pleas­  
ant passenger appeared at the dinner-ta­  
ble with a solemn, downcast expression  
of face and a silent tongue. Before din­  
ner was over, I asked him what troubled  
his mind and caused this unhappy change  
in his wonted cheerful manner.  
At first, he tried to evade my queries  
by replying that it was &quot;nothing, nothing  
in particular but I pressed him persist­  
ently until I won from him an explana­  
tion.  
&quot;Perhaps, after all,&quot; he said, &quot;it is only  
fair that I should explain matters. The  
fact ot the matter is, my watch has been  
stolen.&quot;  
Stolen!&#x27; we all exclaimed in a  
breath.  
&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; he answered &quot;but I  
pray you, captain&quot;here he turned to  
me&quot;say not one word about it. The  
only thing that renders the loss of con­  
sequence to me is the fact that it once  
belonged to my poor mother. On that  
account alone, I would not have lost it  
for any amount of money. However, it  
cannot be nelped, and therefore it is  
useless to cry over spilt milk, as the old  
adage has it. My only request in the  
matter is, my dear captain, that you will  
leave the matter entirely in my hands,  
and I think it very probable that I may  
recover it. This revuest I am sure you  
will oblige me by granting.&quot;  
&quot;Certainly, my dear sir,&quot; I replied  
&quot;but still&quot;  
&quot;Exactly,&quot; he interrupted, with one of  
his pleasant smiles, &quot;you would like to  
take the matter in hand and investigate  
it to the utmost of your power. I know  
that, my dear captain, full well but I  
can trust you to keep your promise, and  
leave the case entirely in my hands.&quot;  
How could I den^him his request.  
Tou will readily imagine what con­  
sternation this event gave rise to among  
the other passengers. The three old  
gentlemen instantly proceeded to explain  
that they possessed jewelry to the value  
of at least three hundred pounds, which  
they usually kept locked up in a brown  
leather writing case but unfortuDatelv,  
at the present time, the lock was out olswain,  
order.  
Mr. Reginald Moore suggested a safer  
deposit for their valuables.  
The young marriGd couples announced  
the tact of their owning at least two  
hundred and fifty pounds&#x27; worth of  
iewelry and they,&quot; too, consulted Mr.  
Moore as to the safest plan of secreting it.  
The kind-hearted brother and sister  
had, it appeared, more valuables in thecask  
way of jewelry than any one on board,  
since fifteen hundred pounds had never  
purchased what they possessed.  
The whole of the evening was occupied  
speculating as to the probable prepe­  
trator of the theft, and in condoling  
with Mr. Reginald Moore on his great  
loss.  
Every one turned in. that night, in an  
uneasy state of mind and it was with  
astonishment that they found themselves  
in the morning still in possession of all  
their worldly goods. This improved  
condition of affairs seemed to reassure our  
passengers, who once again began to look  
cheerful and at ease.  
Reginald Moore&#x27;s pleasant face wore  
its wonted smile, and, as heretofore, he  
enlivened and charmed us with his  
vivacity and anecdote. All day through,  
he worked at the model of the &quot;Janet&#x27;s  
Pride,&quot; still using the top of the empty  
water-cask for a work-table.  
That night we retired to rest with minds  
far more at ease than on the previous  
one. Alas! what a scene of anger and  
distress came with the morning! Every  
passenger on board possessing jewelry  
had been robbed during the* night  
The three old gentlemen, the young  
married couples, and the kind-hearted  
brother ana sister, found themselves  
minus every article of jewelry that they,  
had possessed. Even the grumbling old  
gentleman had lost his gold snuff-box  
There was no keeping matters quiet  
this time. The theif must be traced and  
brought to iustice. What was the wisest  
method of procedure? What would Mr.  
Moore suggest?  
&quot;I would suggest, though most reluct­  
antly,&quot; said Mr. Moore, &quot;that every sailor  
and every sailor&#x27;s luggage be carefully  
searched.&quot;  
To ihis proposition we unaniraouslv  
agreed.  
&quot;This,&quot; he continued, &quot;must be most  
humiliating to the feelings of your crew,  
captain, and therefore, in common fair­  
ness to them as our fellowmen, let me al­  
so suggest that every passenger and every  
passenger&#x27;s luggage be also thoroughly  
searched.&quot;  
A little hesitation on the part of one or  
two of the passengers was demonstrated  
before acceding to this last proposal, but  
our pleasant passenger soon contrived to  
bring those who at first demurred to his  
side of thinking.  
&quot;Or course,*&#x27; he said, &quot;there is not a  
passenger on board who is not above  
suspicion^yet. in justice to the feelings of  
the crew, it is, in my humble opinion,  
the least we can do.&quot;  
This delicacy of feeling and this  
thoughtfulness on the part of Reginald  
Moore, rendered him, if possible, more  
admirable and praiseworthy in our eyes  
than ever.  
Many of the crew objected stiongly to  
this mode of procedure, but all were  
compelled to submit. The old boat­  
swain was furious with indignation, and  
vowed that if it cost him his life he  
would trace the thief who had caused  
him to be searched like a common pick­  
pocket. Even the pleasant passenger  
tailed to soothe his sense of injurv.  
&quot;Well, a thorough search was made bv  
myself, in company with the kind-hearted  
old gentleman and his sister. Everv  
one&#x27;s &quot;traps&quot; were ransacked from top to  
bottom, but without success.  
Further search was useless. What was  
to be done?  
That night all having been snug, and  
passengers having turned in, none of  
them, as you may imagine, in very bril­  
lian* spirits, I went on deck, it being  
wh?t we call at sea &quot;the captain&#x27;s watch.&quot;  
I turned in about four A. M., the second  
officer then coming on duty. My cabin  
was amidships and on deck, and &quot;from a  
window therein I could command a view  
of the after-deck of the ship.  
Somehow or other, I could not rest one  
atom, so, dressing myself, I determined  
sitting up and smoking. I drew  
aside the blmd of the window 1 have  
mentioned, and looked out.  
It was just the gray light of early  
morning, and there was a stiffish breeze  
blowing. To my surprise, I beheld Mr.  
Reginald Moore on deck.  
I was about to open my cabin-door  
and invite him in to join me in my rest­  
lessness, when the peculiar nature &quot;of his  
proceedings livettd my attention. He  
looked around on all sides, as if afraid of  
attracting observation.  
Then, suddenly, as if assured the coast  
was clear, he made rapidly toward the  
empty water-cask, on which he was ac­  
customed to manufacture his model of  
the Janet&#x27;s Pride. Once more glancing  
cautiously about him, he then applied  
his hands to the top of the cask, and with  
a rapid movement lifted half of the top  
bodily off.  
My astonishment and my excitement  
were intense, Another hasty glance  
round, and he plunged his hand down in­  
to the cask, then quickly withdrew it,  
holding in his grasp a small bag, which  
he rapidly concealed in the breast oi his  
coat.  
Again he took a hasty survey, and was  
about making another dive into this  
strange receptacle for hidden goods,  
when he suddenly withdrew,having, with  
_6isi:  
astonishing rapidity, replaced the lid of  
the cask. In another moment the cause  
of his alarm was made apparent, as a  
couple ot sailors passed him on their way  
to relieve the man at the wheel.  
When all was again quiet, for an in­  
stant he seemed determined to at once  
return to the cask, and no doubt with­  
draw something that the interruption  
had prevented him withdrawing in the  
first instance But suddenly changing  
his mind, he went down the stairs that  
led from the deck to the saloon and sleep­  
ing cabins.  
Scarcely had he disappeared, when an­  
other figure, stealthily crossing the deck,  
met my anxious observation. I was the  
boatswain.  
I saw him glance toward the stairs,  
down which Mr. Reginald Moore had  
&#x27;taken his departure. He then made di­  
rect for the water-cask. It was now obvi­  
ous to me that the old boatswain had  
been watching the pleasant passenger.  
Just as he reached the water-cask, a  
heavy green sea struck the ship to wind­  
ward, necessitating the boatswain to hold  
on by a rope so as to keep his footing,  
and precisely at the same moment Regi­  
nald Moore appeared at the top of the  
cabin stairs. I shall never forget the  
scene.  
The instant the ship had steadied her­  
self, the boatswain commenced his exam­  
ination of the water-cask. For a mo­  
ment only, Moore stood looking at him  
with as evil an expression on his face as.  
I ever beheld.  
With one bound he was upon the boat­  
before he could turn to protect  
himself. I waited no longer, but flung  
ODen the door of my cabin in an instant,  
and in another was to the rescue, and in  
a few moments we had our pleasant pas­  
senger in irons So, you see, he was the  
thief, after all, hiding his knavery under  
the pleasantest exterior J. ever knew a  
man possess. The manner in which he  
had manufactured the top of that water  
was the most finished and ingenius  
piece ot carpentry I ever beheld.  
In the interior of the side of the cask  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from the top, on which he had sus­  
pended, in wash-leather bags, the jewel­  
ry he had stolen.  
You may easily imagine the surprise  
evinced by our passengers on discovering  
that the thief was the man for whom  
each and every one ot them entertained  
such regard and even affection.  
At the expiration of taree days from  
the date of the pleasant passenger&#x27;s de­  
tection, we landed in Melbourne, where  
duty compelled me to hand him over to  
the police but as no one cared to remain  
in that town tor the purpose of prosecut­  
ing him, he was summarily dealt with.  
The magistrate sentenced him to six  
months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labor.

I was about to open my cabin-door  
and invite him in to join me in my rest­  
lessness, when the peculiar nature of  
his proceedings riveted my attention.  
He looked around on all sides, as if  
afraid of attracting observation.  
Then, suddenly, as if assured the  
coast was clear, he made rapidly toward  
the empty water-cask, on which he was  
accustomed to manufacture his - model  
of the Janet&#x27;- Pride. Once more  
glancing cautiously about him, he then  
applied his hands to the top of the cask,  
and with a rapid movement lifted half  
of the top bodily off.  
- My astonishment and my excitement  
were intense. Another hasty glance&quot;  
round, and he plunged his hand down  
into the cask, then quickly withdrew it,  
holding in his grasp a small bag, which  
he rapidly concealed in the breast of  
his coat.  
Again he took a hasty survey, and was  
about making another dive into this  
strange receptacle for hidden goods,  
when he suddenly withdrew, having,  
with astonishing rapidity, replaced the  
lid of the cask. In another moment the  
cause of his alarm was made apparent,  
as a couple of sailors passed him on  
their way to relieve the man at the  
wheel.  
When all was again quiet, for an in­  
stant he seemed determined to at once  
return to the cask, and no doubt with­  
draw something that the interruption  
had prevented him withdrawing in the  
first instance. But suddenly changing  
his mind, he went down the stairs that  
led from the deck to the saloon and  
sleeping cabins.  
Scarcely had he disappeared, when  
another figure, stealthily crossing, the  
deck, met my anxious observation. It  
was the boatswain.  
I saw him glance toward the stairs,  
down which Mr. Reginald Moore had  
taken his departure. He then made  
direct for the water-cask. It was now  
obvious to me that the old boatswain  
had been watching the pleasant passen­  
ger. Just as he reached the water-cask, a  
heavy green sea struck the ship to wind­  
ward, necessitating the boatswain to  
hold on by a rope so as to keep his foot­  
ing, and precisely at the same moment  
Reginald Moore appeared at the top of  
the cabin stairs. I shall never forget  
.lie scene.  
1 The instant the ship had steadied her­  
self, the boatswain commenced his ex­  
amination of the water-cask. For a  
moment only, Moore stood, looking at  
him with as evil an expression on his  
face as I ever beheld.  
With one bound he was upon the  
boatswain, before he could turn to pro­  
tect himself. I waited no longer, but  
flung open the door cf my cabin in an  
instant, and in another was to the rescue.  
and in a few moments we had our pleas­  
ant passenger in irons. So, you see,  
he was the thief, after all. hiding his  
knavery under the pleasantest exterior  
I ever knew a man possess. The man­  
ner in which he had manufactured the  
top of that water-cask was the most fin­  
ished and ingenious piece of carpentry  
I ever beheld.  
In the interior of the side of the cask  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from the top, on which he had sus­  
pended, in wash-leather bags, the jew  
elry he had stolen.  
You may easily imagine the surprise  
evinced by our passengers on discover­  
ing that the thief was the man for whom  
each and every one of them entertained  
such regard and even affection.  
At the expiration of three days&#x27; from  
the date of the pleasant passengers de­  
tection, we landed in Melbourne, where  
duty compelled me to hand him over to  
the police; but as no one cared to re­  
main in that town for the purpose of  
prosecuting him, he was summarily  
dealt with. The presiding magistrate  
sentenced him to six months&#x27; imprison­  
ment with hard labor.

Lines to a Skeleton.  
&#x27;$ [Exactly sixtv yearsjago the London Morn­  
ing Chronicle published a poem entitled &quot;Lines  
on a Skeleton,&quot; which excited much attention.  
Every effort, even to the offering of a reward  
of fifty guineas, was vainly made to discover  
its author. All that ever transpired was that  
tlio toem in a fair clerkly hand, was found  
near a skeleton of remarkable beauty ol form  
in the Museum of the Royal College of Surge­  
ons&#x27;, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London, and that the  
Curstor of the Museum had sent them to Mr.  
Perry, editor and proprietor of the Morning  
Chronicle  
Behold this ruin! &#x27;Twas a skull.  
Once of ethereal spirit full  
This narrow cell was life&#x27;s retreat  
This space was thought&#x27;s mysteriousjseat,  
What beauteous visions filed this spot!  
What dreams of pleasure long forgot!  
Nohope, nor joy, nor love, nor fear,  
Have left one trace of record here.  
Beneaththis moldering canopy  
One shone the bright and busy eye  
But start not at the dismal void  
If social love that eye employed:  
If with no lawless fire it gleamed,  
But through the dew of kindness beamed,  
That eye shall be forever brieht  
When stars and suns are sunk in night.  
Within this hollow cavern hung  
The ready, swift and tuneful tongue.  
IT falsehood&#x27;s honey it disdained,  
And where it could not praise was chained  
If bold in virtuc&#x27;&amp; cause it spoke,  
Yet gentle concord never broke,  
This silent tongue shall plead for thee  
When time unveils eternity.  
Say, did these fingers delve the mire?  
Or with its envied rubies shine?  
To hew the rock, or wear the gem,  
Can little now avail to them.  
But if the page of truth they sought,  
Or comfort to the mourner brought.  
The hands a richer meed shall claim  
Than all that wait on wealth or fame.  
Avails it whether bared or shod  
These feet the paths of duty trod?  
If from the halls of ease they fled,  
To seek affection&#x27;s humble shed,  
If grandeur&#x27;s guilty bride they spurned,  
And home to virtue&#x27;s cot returned,  
These feet with angel&#x27;s wings shall vie,  
And tread the palace of the sky.  
OUR PASSENGER.  
THE CAPTAIN S STORY.  
Hit was a lovely autumn atternoon to­  
ward the close of September, when we  
weighed anchor, and sailed out of the  
river Mersey, bound for Melbourne. We  
had a good shipJanet&#x27;s Prideloaded  
with miscellaneous articles. On board  
were fourteen passengers, and take them  
all in all, a pleasanter lot I never steered  
across the stormy seas.  
There were three old gentlemen, who  
were going out to share their fortunes,  
come what might, and which, poor old  
souls, they seemed to think tashioned in  
.the brightest colors, long before the  
English coast was out of sight.  
Then there was a solitary old getle­  
man, who, judging from thcgeneral tone  
of his conversation, was seeking the new  
world for the the ostensible purpose ot  
fading fault with it.  
There were two young married couples,  
all full of hone and activity, bent upon  
making a new home far away from their  
native land.  
There were also a very jolly elderly  
brother and sister, neither of whom had  
ever entered into the bonds of matri­  
mony, but instead, had stuck by each  
other through life.  
There were three old Australian set­  
tlers, who had been over to have a peep  
at the old country, and who were now re­  
turning to the land which to them,  
through long communion, had become  
the dearest of all others&quot;Home, sweet  
home!&quot;  
Lastly, though not least, there was a  
solitary passenger, who -soon became the  
pet of all on board. He was a man of  
about eight-and-twenty years of age,  
possessing a very clear complexion, a  
Tery handsome, long-flowme beard, and  
a very silky mustache.  
His mime was Reginald Moore. His  
given reason for taking this sea voyage  
~was the delicate state of his health.  
There was not the least doubt that the  
poor fellow&#x27;s chest was considerably af­  
fected, though his voice, charmingly  
sweet, was one of the weakest 1 ever re­  
member hearing and it had a certain  
hollowness in its sound that in my mind  
is invariably associated with that terrible  
disease commonly termed consumption.  
He always wore a thick muffler round  
his neck to protect his throat and chest.  
In all my experienceand it has been  
pretty wideI never knew any one with  
so many friends, and such undivided es­  
teem, in so short a space of time, as Regi­  
nald Moore. There was not, I believe, a  
sailor ou board who did not entertain the  
warmest possible liking for him.  
As for the passengers, they never  
seemed so happy as when listening to  
his amusing anecdotes, of which he seemed  
to possess an inexhaustible store. And  
this delicate young English paragon of  
passengers had made his conquest over  
all our hearts before we had been three  
weeks at sea.  
He was, too, such a clever fellow with  
his hands. He could cut and shape you  
anything out of a piece of wood, from an  
oyster to a elephant and at making mod  
els of ships, I never met his equal. He  
was, besiaes, such a kind and considerate  
fellow toward his fellow-passengers.  
When the three elderly gentlemen, who  
imagined their fortunes made, were af­  
flicted with sea-sickness, he was the first  
^to come forward and help them about  
while they slowly recovered. He would  
insist upon their taking his arm, weak as  
he was himself, and he would lead them  
about on the deck with a firmness that  
spoke volumes in favor of his &quot;sea legs.&#x27;  
I do not remember any voyage passiDg  
so quickly as the one when the pleasant  
pas^engo- was on board. I could, with  
infinite pleasure, make a long pause at  
this juncture in the thread of my story,  
to dwell upon the pleasant memories I  
still retain of Reginald Moore.  
We were within a week&#x27;s sail of Mel­  
bourne. Reginald Moore had all but  
completed a model of the Janet&#x27;s Pride,  
which he proposed presenting to me the  
night before we landed.  
Now the work at this model princi­  
pally on deck, and strangely enough, he  
had chosen for a work table one of the  
empty water-casks that stood on deck,  
abaft, and under the shelter of the bul­  
warks,  
While he worked through the day, you  
were sure to see him surrounded by some  
of the passengers or sailors. The amount  
of industry he displayed was trully won­  
derful, for he was invariably at work in  
the early morning, long before any of the  
other passengers dreamt of turning out  
of their snug berths.  
As I have already stated, we were but  
six days&#x27; sailfromMelbourae. For the first  
OWR^MVWVWWS^  
time in our experience of him, the pleas­  
ant passenger appeared at the dinner-ta­  
ble with a solemn, dewncast expression  
of face and a silent tongue. Before din­  
ner was over, I asked him what troubled  
bis mind and caused this unhappy change  
in bis wonted cheerful manner.  
At first, he tried to evade my queries  
by replying that it was &quot;nothing, nothing  
in particular but I pressed him persist­  
ently until I won from him an explana­  
tion.  
&quot;Perhaps, after all,&quot; he said, &quot;it is only  
fair that I should explain matters. The  
fact ot the matter is, my watch has been  
stolen.&quot;  
Stolen!&quot; we all exclaimed in a  
breath.  
&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; he answered &quot;but I  
prsy you, captain&quot;here he turned to  
me&quot;say not one word #bout it. The  
only thine that renders the loss of con­  
sequence to me is the fact that it once  
belonged to my poor mother. On that  
account alone, I would not have lost it  
for any amount of money. However, it  
cannot be helped, and therefore it is  
useless to cry over spilt milk, as the old  
adage has it. My only request in the  
matter is, my dear captain, that you will  
leave the matter entirely in my hands,  
and I think it very probable that I may  
recover it. This revuest&#x27;l am sure you  
will oblige me by granting.&quot;  
&quot;Certainly, my dear sir,&quot; I replied  
&quot;but still&quot;-  
&quot;Exactly,&quot; he interrupted, with one of  
his pleasant smiles, &quot;you would like to  
take the matter in hand and investigate  
it to the utmost of your power. I know  
that, my dear captain, full well but I  
can trust you to keep your promise, and  
leave the case entirely in my hands.&quot;  
How could I deny him his reouest.  
You will readily imagine what con­  
sternation this event gave rise to among  
the other passengers. The three old  
gentlemen instantly proceeded to explain  
that they possessed jewelry to the value  
of at least three hundred pounds, which  
they usually kept locked up in a brown  
leather writing case but unfortunately,  
at the present time, the lock was out of  
order.  
Mr. Reginald Moore suggested a safer  
deposit for their valuables.  
The young married couples announced  
the tact of their owning at least two  
hundred and fifty pounds&#x27; worth of  
iewelry and they,&quot; too, consulted Mr.  
Moore as to the safest plan of secreting it.  
The kind-hearted brother and sister  
had, it appeared, more valuables in the  
way of jewelry than any one on board,  
since fifteen hundred pounds bad never  
purchased what they possessed.  
The whole of the evening was occupied  
speculating as to the probable prepe­  
trator of the theft, and in condoling  
with Mr. Reginald Moore on his great  
loss.  
Every one turned in. that night, in an  
uneasy state of mind and it was with  
astonishment that thty found themselves  
in the morning still in possession of all  
their worldly goods. This improved  
condition of affairs seemed to reassure our  
passengers, who once again began to look  
cheerful and at ease.  
Reginald Moore&#x27;s pleasant face wore  
its wonted smile, and, as heretofore, he  
enlivened and charmed us with his  
vivacity and anecdote. All day through,  
he worked at the model of the &quot;Janet&#x27;s  
Pride,&quot; still using the top of the empty  
water-cask for a work-table.  
That night we retired to rest with minds  
far more at ease than on the previous  
one. Alas! what a scene of anger and  
distress came with the morning! Every  
passenger on board possessing jewelry  
had been robbed during the night  
The three old gentlemen, the young  
married couples, and the kind-hearted  
brother and sister, found themselves  
minus every article of iewelry that they  
had possessed. Even the grumbling old  
gentleman had lost his gold snuff-box.  
There was no keeping matters quiet  
this time. The theif must be traced and  
brought to justice. What was the wisest  
method of procedure? What would Mr.  
Moore suggest?  
&quot;I would suggest, though most reluct­  
antly,&quot; said Mr. Muore, &quot;that every sailor  
and every sailor&#x27;s luggage be carefully  
searched.&quot;  
To this proposition we unanimously  
agreed.  
&quot;This,&quot; he continued, &quot;must be most  
humiliating to the feelings of your crew,  
captain, and therefore, in common fair­  
ness to them as our fellowmen, let me al­  
so suggest that every passenger and every  
passenger&#x27;s luggage be also thoroughly  
searched.&quot;  
A little hesitation on the part of one or  
two of the passengers was demonstrated  
before acceding to this last proposal, but  
our pleasant passenger soon contrived to  
bring those who at first demurred to his  
side of thinking.  
&quot;Or course,&quot; he said, &quot;there is not a  
passenger on board who is not above  
suspicion, yet. in justice to the feelings of  
the crew, it is, in my humble opinion,  
the least we can do.&quot;  
This delicacy of feeling and this  
thoughtfulness on the part of Reginald  
Moore, rendered him, if possible, more  
admirable and praiseworthy in our eyes  
than ever.  
Many of the crew objected strongly to  
this mode of procedure, but all were  
compelled to submit. The old boat­  
swain was furious with indignation, and  
vowed that if it cost him his life he  
would trace the thief who had caused  
him to be searched like a common pick­  
pocket. Even the pleasant passenger  
tailed to soothe his sense ot injurv.  
&quot;Well, a thorough search was made by  
myself, in company with the kind-hearted  
old gentleman and his sister. Everv  
one&#x27;s &quot;traps&quot; were ransacked from top to  
bottom, but without success.  
Further search was useless. What was  
to be done?  
That night all having been snug, and  
passengers having turned in, none of  
them, as you may imagine, in very bril­  
liant spirits, I went on deck, it being  
wb?t we call at sea &quot;the captain&#x27;s watch.&quot;  
I turned in about four A. M., the second  
officer then coming on duty. My cabin  
was amidships and on deck, and from a  
window therein I could command a view  
of the after-deck of the ship.  
Somehow or other, I could not rest one  
atom, so, dressing myself, I determined  
upon sitting up and smoking. I drew  
aside the blind of the window have  
mentioned, and looked out.  
It was just the gray light of early  
morning, and there was a stiffish breeze  
blowing. To my surprise, I beheld Mr.  
Reginald Moore on deck.  
^js^ia**wii***^V(  
I was about to open my cabin-door  
and invite him in to join me in my rest­  
lessness, when the peculiar nature of his  
proceedings riveted my attention. He  
looked around on all sides, as if afraid of

Then, suddenly, as if assured the coast

empty water-cask, on which he was ac­  
customed to manufacture his model of  
the Janet&#x27;s Pride. Once more glancing  
cautiously about him, he then applied  
his hands to the top of the cask, and with  
a rapid movement lifted half of the top  
bodily off.  
My astonishment and my excitement  
were intense, Another hasty glance  
round, and he plunged his hand down in­  
to the cask, then quickly withdrew it,  
holding in his grasp a small bag, which  
he rapidly concealed in the breast of his  
coat.  
Again he took a hasty survey, and was  
about making another dive into this  
strange receptacle for hidden goods,

astonishing rapidity, replaced the lid of  
the cask. In another moment the cause  
of his alarm was made apparent, as a

When all was again quiet, for an in­

led from the deck to the saloon and sleep­

Scarcely had he disappeared, when an­  
other figure, stealthily crossing the deck,  
met my anxious observation. It was the  
boatswain.  
I saw him glance toward the stairs,  
down which Mr. Reginald Moore had  
taken his departure. He then made di­  
rect for the water-cask. It was now obvi­  
ous to me that the old boatswain had  
been watching the pleasant passenger.  
Just as he reached the water-cask, a  
heavy green sea struck the ship to wind­  
ward, necessitating the boatswain to hold  
on by a rope so as to keep his footing,  
and precisely at the same moment Regi­  
nald Moore appeared at the top of the  
eabin stairs. I shall never forget the  
scene.  
The instant the ship had steadied her­  
self, the boatswain commenced his exam­  
ination of the water-cask. For a mo­  
ment only, Moore stood looking at him  
with as evil an expression on his face as  
I ever beheld.  
With one bound he was upon the boat­  
swain, before he could turn to protect  
himself. I waited no longer, but flung  
ore the door of my cabin in an instant,  
and in another was to the rescue, and in  
a few moments we had our pleasant pas­  
senger in irons So, you see, he was the  
thief, after all, hiding his knavery under  
the pleasantest exterior I ever knew a  
man possess. The manner in which he  
had manufactured the top of that water  
cask was the most finished and ingenius  
piece oi carpentry I ever beheld.  
In the interior of the side of the cask  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from the top, on which he had sus­

ry he had stolen.  
You may easily imagine the surprise  
evinced by our passengers on discovering  
that the thief was the man far whom  
each and every one ot them entertained  
su I Regard and even affection.  
J-r- the expiration of taree days from  
the date of the pleasant passenger&#x27;s de­  
tection, we landed in Melbourne, where  
duty compelled me to hand him over to

me—&quot;day not one word about it. The  
only thing that renders theloss of con­  
sequence to me is the fact that it once  
belonged to my poor mo&#x27;her. On that  
account alone, I would not have lost it  
for any amount of money. However, it  
cannot be helped, and therefore it is  
useless to cry over spilt milk, as the old  
adage has it. My only request in the  
matter is, my dear captain, that you will  
leave the matter entirely in my hands,  
and I think it very probable that I may  
recover it. This revuest 1 am sure you  
will oblige me by granting.&quot;  
&quot;Certainly, my dear sir,&quot; I replied  
&quot;but still&quot;—  
&quot;Exactly,&quot; he interrupted, with one of  
his pleasant smiles, &quot;you would like to  
take the matter in hand and investigate  
it to the utmost of your power. I know  
that, my dear captain, full well but I  
can trust y.ou to keep your promise, and  
leave the case entirely in my hands.&quot;  
  
How could I deny him his reouest.  
You will readily imagine what con­  
sternation this event gave rise to among  
the other passengers. The three old  
gentlemen instantly proceeded to explain  
that they possessed jewelry to the value  
of at least three hundred pounds, which  
they usually kept locked up in a brown  
leather writing case but unfortunately,  
at the present time, the lock was out of  
order.  
  
Mi. Reginald Moore suggested a safer  
deposit tor tbeir valuables.  
The yountr married couples announced  
the tact of their owning at least two  
hundred and fifty pounds&#x27; worth of  
iewelry and they, too, consulted Mr.  
Moore as to the safest plan of secreting it.  
  
The kind hearted brother and sister  
had, it appeared, more valuables in the  
way of jewelry than any one on board,  
since fifteen hundred pounds bad never  
purchased what they possessed.  
  
The- whole of the evening was occupied  
in speculating as to the probable prepe­  
trator of the theft, and in condoling  
with Mr. Reginald Moore on his great  
loss.  
  
Every one turned in. that night, in an  
uneasy state of mind and it was with  
astonishment that they found themselves  
in the morning still in possession of all  
  
their ^orjfdjy Kpods:&#x27;&#x27;Tfayimproved  
condition of affairs seemecl to reassure our  
passengers, who once again began to look  
cheerful and at ease.  
  
Reginald Moore&#x27;s pleasant face wore  
its&#x27; wonted smile, and,1 as heretofore he  
enlivened&#x27;&#x27;and charmed&#x27;&#x27;us with his  
vivacity and anecdote. All day through,  
he worked at the model of the &quot;Janet&#x27;s  
Pride,&quot; still using the top of, the •qmpty  
water-cask for a work-table. /.  
  
That night&#x27;we retired to rest with minds  
fa* more at ease than on* the1 previous  
one. Alas! what a scene of anger and  
distress came with the morning! Every  
passenger on board possessing jewelry  
had been robbed during the night.  
  
The threa old&#x27; gentlemen, the young  
married ,couples. and the kind-hearted  
brother and sister, found&#x27; themselves  
minus every article of jewelry &#x27;that they  
had possessed. Even the grumbling old  
gentleman had lost his gold snuff-bpx  
  
There was no keeping matters quiet  
this time The theif must be traced and  
brought to iustico. What was the wisest  
method of procedure? What would Mr.  
Moore suggest?  
&quot;I would suggest, though most reluct­  
antly,&quot; said Mr. Moore, &quot;that, every sailor  
and every sailor&#x27;s luggage be carefully  
searched.&quot;.  
  
To ihjs proposition we unanimously  
agreed.,  
&quot;This,&quot; he continued, &#x27;&#x27;must be most  
humiliating to the feelings of your crew,  
captain, and therefore, in common fair­  
ness to them as our fellowmen, let me al­  
so suggest that every passenger and every  
passenger&#x27;s luggage bo also thoroughly  
searched.&quot;  
  
A little hesitation on&#x27; the part of one or  
two pt the passengers was demonstrated  
.before acceding to this last proposal, but  
our pleasant passenger soon contrived to  
bring those who at first demurred to his  
side of thinking.  
&quot;Or course,&quot; he said, &quot;there is not a  
passenger on board who is not above  
suspicion, yejt. in justice to thefeelings of  
the cien, it is, in my humble opinion,  
the least we can do.&quot;  
  
This delicacy of feeling anid this  
thoughtfuincss on the part of Reginald  
Moore, rendeicd him, if possible, more  
admirable and praiseworthy in our eyes  
than ever  
  
Many of the crew objected strongly to  
this mode of procedure, bnt all were  
compelled to submit. The old boat  
wain was furious with indignation, and  
vowed that if it cost him hi* life he  
would trace the thief who had caused  
him to be searched like a common pick­  
pocket. Even the pleasant passenger  
tailed to soothe his sense ot injury.  
&quot;Well, a thorough search was made by  
myself, in company with the kind-hearted  
old gentleman and his sister. Every  
one&#x27;s &quot;traps&quot; were ransacked from top to  
bottom, but without success.  
  
Further search was useless. What was  
to be done?  
That night all having been snug, and  
passengers having turned in, none of  
them, as you may imagine, in very bril­  
lian* spirits, I went on deck, it being  
wb?t we call at sea &quot;the captain&#x27;s watch.&quot;  
1 turned in about four A. M., the second  
officer then coming on duty. My cabin  
was amidships and on deck, and &quot;from a  
window therein I could command a view  
of the after-deck of the ship.  
  
Somehow or other, I could not rest one  
atom, so, dressing myself, I determined  
upon sitting up and smoking. I drew  
aside the blind of the window have  
mentioned, and looked out.  
  
It was just the gray light of early  
morning, and there was a stifnsh breeze  
blowing. To my surprise, I beheld Mr.  
Reginald Moore on deck.  
  
I was about to open my cabin-door  
and invite him in to join me in my rest­  
lessness, when the pecuiiai nature &quot;of his  
proceedings riveted my attention. He  
looked around on all sides, aa if afraid of  
attracting observation.  
  
Then, suddenly, as if assured the coast  
was clear, he niide rapidly toward the  
empty water-cask, on which he was ac  
customed to manufacture his model of  
the Janet&#x27;s Pride. Once more glancing  
cautiously about him, he then applied  
his hands to thetop of the cask, and with  
a lapid movenipnt lifted half of the top  
bodily off.  
  
My astonishment and my excitement  
were intense, Another hasty glance  
round, and he plunged his hand down in­  
to the cask, then quickly withdrew it.  
holding in his grasp a small bag, which  
he rapidly* concealed in the breast ot his  
coat.  
  
Again he took a hasty survey, and was  
about making another dive into this  
strange receptacle for hidden goods,  
when he suddenly withdrew,having, with  
astonishing rapidity, replaced &#x27;helid of  
the cask In another moment the cause  
of his alarm was made apparent, as a  
couple ot sailors passed him on theii way  
to relieve the man at the wheel.  
  
When all was again quiet, for an in­  
stant he seemed determined to at once  
return to the cask, and no doubt with­  
draw something that the interruption  
had prevented him withdrawing in the  
first instance But suddenly changing  
his mind, he went down the stairs that  
led from, tue deck to the saloon and sleep  
ing cabins  
  
Scarcely had he disappeared, when an­  
other figure, stealthily crossing the deck,  
met my anxious observation. It was the  
boatswain.  
  
I saw him glance toward the stairs,  
down which Mr. Reginald Moore had  
taken his dcpaiture He then made di­  
rect for the water cask. It was now obvi­  
ous to me that the old boatswain had  
been watching the pleasant passenger.  
  
Just as he reached the water cask, a  
heavy green sea struck the ship to wind­  
ward, necessitating theboatswain to hold  
on by a rope so as to keep his footing,  
and precisely at the same moment Regi­  
nald Moore appeared at the top of the  
cabin stairs. I shall nsver forget the  
scene  
  
The instant the ship bad steadied her­  
self, the boatswain commenced bis exam­  
ination cf the water cask. For a mo­  
ment only, Moore stood looking at him  
with as evil an expression on his face as  
I ever beheld.  
  
With one bound he was upon the boat­  
swain, oefore he could turn to protect  
himself. I waited no longei, but flung  
onen the door of my cabin in an instant,  
and in another was to therescue, and in  
a few moments wc had our pleasant pas­  
senger in irons So, you see, he was the  
thief, after all, hiding his knavery under  
the pleasantest exterior I ever knew a  
man possess. The manner in which he  
had manufactured the top of that water  
cask was the most finished and ingenius  
piece ot carpentry I ever beheld.  
  
In the interior of the side of the cask  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from the top, on which he had sus­  
pended, in wash-leather bags, the jewel­  
ry bo had stolen.  
  
Vou may easily imagine the surprise  
cviuced by our passengers on discovepng  
that the thief was the man for whom  
each and every one ot them entertained  
such regard ,»nd even affection.  
  
At the \piration of rec dayE from,  
tile date of the pleasant passenger&#x27;s de  
tectiou, we landed in Melbourne, where  
duty compelled me to baud him over to  
the police but a3 no one cared to remain  
in that town for the purpose of prosecut­  
ing him, he was summarily dealt with.  
The magistrate sentenced him to six  
months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labor.

Again he took a hasty survey, aud was  
: about making another dive into this  
strange receptacle for hidden goods, wheu  
he suddenly withdrew, having, with  
astonishing rapidity, replaced the lid of  
the cask. In another moment the cause  
of his alarm was made apparent, as a  
j couple of sailors passed him* on their  
&#x27; way to relieve the man at the wheel.  
When all was again quiet for an in­  
stant he seemed determined to at once  
i return to the cask, and no doubt with  
drew something more that the interrup­  
tion had prevented him withdrawing in  
the first instance. But suddenly chanc­  
ing his mind, he went down the stairs  
that led from the deck to the saloon and  
sleeping cabins.  
Scarcely had he disappeared, when  
another figure, stealthily crossing the  
deck, met my anxious observatiou. It  
was the boatswain.  
I saw him glance towards the stairs  
down which Mr. Reginald Moore had  
taken ins departure. He then made di­  
rect for the water cask. It was now ob  
vioua to me that the old boatswain had  
been watching tlie pleasant passenger.  
Just as he reached the water cask, a  
heavy green sea struck the sea to wind­  
ward, necessitating the boatswain to hold  
ou by the ropes so as to keeu his footing  
and precisely at the same moment Regi­  
nald Moore appeared at the top of the  
cabin stairs. I shall never forget the  
scene.  
The instant the ship had steadied her­  
self, the boatswain commenced his ex  
animation of the water cask. For a mo­  
ment only Moore stood looking at him  
with as evil au expression on his face as  
I ever beheld.  
With one bound, he was upon the boat­  
swain, before he could turn to protect  
himeclf. 1 wkited no longer bat Hung  
open the door of my cabin iu au instant,  
aud in another I was to the rescue, aud  
iu a few moments we had our pleasant  
passenger iu irons.  
So, you see, he was the thief after all,  
hiding his knavery under the pleasantest  
exterior I ever knew a man to possess.  
The manner in which he had manufac­  
tured the top of the water cask was the  
most finished and ingenious piece of  
carpentry I have ever beheld.  
In the interior of the side of the cask  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from the top, on which he had sus­  
pended, iu wash-weather bags, the jewel­  
ry he had stolen.  
You may easily imagine the surprise  
evinced by our passengers on discovering  
that the thief was the man for whom  
each and every oue of them entertained  
such regard and even affection !  
At the expiration of three days from  
the date of the pleasant passenger’s de  
tection we landed iu Melbourne, where  
duty compelled me to hand him over to  
the police; but as no one cared to remain  
in that town for the purpose of prosecu­  
ting him, he was summarily dealt with.  
The presiding magistrate sentenced him  
to six years’ imprisonment.

 two  
hundred and fifty pounds’worth of jew­  
elry; and they, too, consulted Mr.  
Moore as to the safest plan for secret­  
ing it.  
The kind-hearted brother and sister  
had, it appeared, more valuables in the  
way of jewelry than any one on board,  
since fifteen hundred pounds had never  
purchased what they possessed.  
The whole ot that evening was occu­  
pied in speculating as to the probable  
perpetrator of the theft, and in condol­  
ing with Mr. Reginald Moore on his  
great loss.  
Everyone turned in that night in an  
uneasy state of mind, and it was with  
astonishment that the}&#x27; found them­  
selves, in the morning, still in posses­  
sion of all their worldly goods. This  
improved condition of affairs seemed  
to reassure our passengers, who once  
again began to look cheerful and at  
ease.  
Reginald Moore’s pleasant face wore  
its wonted smile, and, as heretofore, he  
enlivened and charmed us with his vi­  
vacity and anecdote. All day through  
he worked on the model of the Janet’s  
Pride, still using the top of the empty  
water cask for a work table.  
That night we retired to rest with  
minds far more at ease than the pre­  
vious one, Alas! what a scene of an­  
ger and distress came with the morn­  
ing! Every passenger on board possess­  
ing jewelry had been robbed during the  
night.  
The three old gentlemen, the young  
married couple, and the kind hearted  
brother and sister, found themselves  
minus every article of jewelry that  
they had possessed. Even the grum­  
bling old gentleman had lost his gold  
snuff box!  
  
There was no keeping matters quiet  
this time. The thief must be traced  
and brought to justice. What was the  
wisest method of procedure? What  
would Mr. Moore suggest?  
“I would suggest, tnough most reluc­  
tantly’’ said Mr. Moore, “that every  
sailor and every sailor’s luggage be  
carefully searched.”  
To this proposition we unanimously  
agreed.  
“ This,” he continued, “ must be most  
humiliating to the feelings of your crew,  
captain, and therefore, in common fair­  
ness to them as our fellow-men, let me  
also suggest that every passenger’s lug­  
gage be also thoroughly searched.”  
A little hesitation on the part of one  
or two of the passengers was demon­  
strated before acceding to this last pro­  
posal, but our pleasant passenger soon  
contrived to bring those who at first de­  
murred to his side of thinking.  
“Of course,” he said, “there is not a  
passenger on board who is not above  
suspicion, yet, injustice to the feelings  
of the crew, it is, in my humble opin­  
ion, the least we can do.”  
This delicacy of feeling and this  
thoughtfulness on the part of Reginald  
Moore, rendered him, if possible, more  
admirable and praiseworthy in our eyes  
than ever.  
Many of the crew objected strongly  
to this mode of procedure, but all were  
compelled to submit. The old boat­  
swain was furious with indignation, and  
vowed that if it cost him his life he  
would trace the thief who had caused  
him to be searched like a common  
pickpocket. Even the pleasant passen­  
ger failed to soothe his sense of injury.  
Well, thorough search was made by  
myself, in company with the kind old  
gentleman and his sister. Everjr one’s  
“traps” were ransacked from top to bot­  
tom without success.  
Further search was useless. What  
was to be done?  
That night, all having been made  
snug, and the passengers having turned  
in, none of them, as you may imagine,  
in very brilliant spirits, 1 went on deck,  
it being what we call at sea “the cap­  
tain’s watch.”  
I turned in about 4 a. m., the second  
officer then coming on duty. My cab­  
in was amidships and on deck, and  
from a window therein I could com­  
mand a view of the after deck of the  
ship.  
Somehow or other I could not rest  
one atom; so, dressing myself. I deter­  
mined upon sitting up and smoking. I  
drew aside the blind of the window I  
have mentioned, and looked out.  
It was just the gray light of early  
morning, and there was astiflish breeze  
blowing. To my surprise, I beheld Mr.  
Reginald Moore on deck.  
I was aoout to open my cabin door  
and invite him to join me in my rest­  
lessness, when the peculiar nature of his  
proceedings rivited my attention. He  
looked around on all sides, as if afraid  
of attracting observation.  
Then, suddenly, as if assured the  
coast was clear, he made rapidly to­  
ward the empty water-cask, on which  
he was accustomed to manufacture his  
model of the “Janet’s Pride.’* Once  
more glancing cautiously about him,  
he then applied his hands to the top of  
  
the cask, and with a rapid movement,  
lifted half of the top bodily off.  
My astonishment and excitement  
were intense. Another hasty glance  
around, and he plunged his hand down  
into the cask, then quickly withdrew it,  
holding in his grasp a small bag, which  
he rapidly concealed in the breast of  
his coat.  
Again he took a hasty surve}r, and  
was about making another dive into this  
strange receptable for hidden goods,  
when he suddenly withdrew, having,  
with astonishing rapidity, replaced the  
lid of the cask. In another moment  
the cause of his alarm was made ap­  
parent, as a couple of sailors passed  
on their way to relieve the man at the  
wheel.  
When all was again qjiiet for an  
instant he seemed determined to at  
once return to the cask, and no doubt  
withdraw something more that the in­  
terruption had prevented him with­  
drawing in the first instance. But sud­  
denly changing his mind, he went down  
the stairs that led from the deck to the  
saloon and sleeping cabins.  
Scarcely had he disappeared, when  
another tigure, stealthily crossing the  
deck, met my anxious observation. It  
was the boatswain.  
I saw him glance towards the stairs  
down which Mr. Reginald Moore had  
taken his departure. He then made  
direct for the water cask. It was now  
obvious to me that the old boatswain  
had been watching the pleasant pas­  
senger.  
Just as he reached the water cask, a  
heavy green sea struck the ship to  
windward, necessitating the boatswain  
to hold on by the ropes so as to keep  
his footing, and precisely at the same  
moment Keginal Moore appeared at  
the top of the cabin stairs. I shall  
never forget the scene.  
The instant the ship had steadied her­  
self, the boatswain commenced his ex­  
amination of the water cask. For a

him, with as an evil expression as 1

With one bound he was upon the  
boatswain, before he could turn to pro­  
tect himself. I waited no longer, hut  
Hung open the door of my cabin in an  
instant, and in another I was to the

I was about to open my cabin door

Then, suddenly, as if assured the

the empty water cask, on which he was

his hands to the top of the cask, and

the top bodily off.  
  
My astonisnment and my excitement  
were intense. Another hasty glance

he rapidly concealed in the breast of his

dition of affairs seemed to reassure  
our passengers, who once again began to  
look cheerful and at ease.  
  
Reginald Moore’s pleasant face wore  
its wonted smile, ana, as heretofore, he  
enlivened and charmed us with his  
vivacity and anecdotes. All day  
through he worked on the model of the  
Janet’s Pride, still using the top of the  
empty water cask for a work table.  
That night we retired to rest with mind  
far more at ease than on the previous  
one. Alas! what a sense of anger and  
distress came with the morning! Every  
passenger on board possessing jewelry had  
been robbed during the night.  
The three old gentlemen, the young  
married couples, and the kind-hearted  
brother and sister, found themselves  
minus of every article of jewelry that  
they had possessed. Even the grumbling  
old gentleman had lost his gold snuff­  
box.  
There was no keeping matters quiet  
this time. The thief must be traced and  
brought to justice. What was the wisest  
method of procedure? What would Mr.  
Moore suggest?  
To this proposition we unanimously  
agreed.  
“This,” he continued, “ must be most  
humiliating to the feelings of your crew,  
captain, and therefore, in common fair­  
ness to them as our fellow-men, let me  
also suggest that every passenger and  
every passenger’s luggage be also thor­  
oughly searched.”  
A little hesitation on the part of one  
or two of the passengers was demon­  
strated before acceding to this last pro­  
posal, but our pleasant passenger soon  
contrived to bring those who at first  
demurred to his side of thinking.  
“Of course,” he said, “ there is not a  
passenger on board who is not above sus­  
picion, yet, in justice to the feelings of  
the crew, it is in my humble opinion,  
the least we can do.”  
This delicacy of feeling and this  
thoughtfulness or the part of Reginald  
Moore rendered him, if possible, more  
admirable and praiseworthy in our eyes  
than ever.  
Many of the crew objected strongly to  
this mode of procedure, but ail were  
compelled to submit. The old boatswain  
was furious with indignation, and vowed  
that if it cost him his life he would trace  
the thief who had caused him to be  
searched like a common pickpocket.  
Even the pleasant passenger failed to  
soothe his sense of injury.  
Well, a thorough search was made by

hearted old gentleman and his sister.  
Every one’s “traps” were ransacked  
from top to bottom without success.  
Further search was useless. What  
was to be done?  
That night, all having been made snug,  
and the passengers having turned in,  
none of them, as you may imagine, in  
very brilliant spirits, 1 went on deck, it  
being what we call at sea “ the captain’s  
waten,”  
I turned in about 4 a. m., the second  
officer then coming on duty. My cabin  
was amidships and on deck, and from a  
window therein I could command a view  
of the after-deck of the ship.  
Somehow or other, I could not rest one

holding in his grasp a small bag, which  
he rapidly concealed in the breast of his

Again he took a hasty survey, and  
was about making another dive into this  
strange receptacle lor hidden goods,  
when fie suddenly withdrew, having,  
with astonishing rapidity, replaced the  
lid of the cask. In another moment  
the cause of his alarm was made appar­  
ent. as a couple of sailors passed him on  
their way to relieve the man at the  
wheel.  
When all was again quiet, for an  
instant he seemed determined to at once  
  
return to the cask, and no doubt with­  
draw something more that the interrup­  
tion had prevented him withdrawing m  
the first instance. But suddenly chang­  
ing his mind, he went down the stairs  
that led from the deck to the saloon and  
sleeping cabins.  
Scarcely had he disappeared when an­  
other figure, stealthily crossing the deck,  
met my anxious observation. It was the  
boatswain.  
I saw him glance towards the stairs,  
down which Mr. Reginald Moore had  
taken his departure. He then made  
direct for the water cask. It was now  
obvious to me that the old boatswain had  
oeen watching the pleasant passenger.  
Just as he reached the water cask a  
heavy green sea struck the ship to wind­  
ward, necessitating the boatswain to hold  
on by the ropes so as to keep his footing,  
and precisely at the same moment Regi­  
nal Moore appeared at the top of the  
cabin stairs. I shall never forget the  
scene.  
The instant the ship had steadied her­  
self the boatswain commenced his exam­  
ination of the water cask. For a mo­  
ment only, Moore stood looking at him  
with as evil an expression on his face as  
I ever beheld.  
  
With one bound he was upon the boat­  
swain before he could turn to protect  
himself. I waited no longer, but flung  
open the door of my cabin in an instant,  
and in another I was to the rescue, and  
in a few moments we had our pleasant  
passenger in irons.  
So, you see, he was the thief, after all,  
hiding his knavery under the pleasantest  
exterior I ever knew a man possess. The  
manner in which he had manufactured  
the top of that water cask was the most  
finished and ingenious piece of carpen­  
tery I have ever beheld.  
In the interior of the side of the cask  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from the top, on which he had sus­  
pended, in wash-leather bags, the jewelry  
he had stolen.  
You may easily imagine the surprise  
evinced by our passengers on discovering  
that the thief was the man for whom  
each and every one of them entertained  
such regard and even affection.  
At the expiration of three days from  
the date of the pleasant passenger&#x27;s de­  
tection, we landed in Melbourne, where  
duty compelled me to hand him over to  
the police; but as no one cared to remain  
in that town for the purpose of prose­  
cuting him, he was summarily dealt  
with. The presiding magistrate sen­  
tenced him to six months’ imprisonment  
with hard labor.

This space was Taought&#x27;s nijster&#x27;ous seat.  
Wtiat beauteous visions tilled this spot!

But tnrt not at the dismal void;  
If social Love that eje employed;  
If with no lawless tire It gleamed.  
But through the dew of kindness beamed.  
Thai eye shall be forever bright  
When stars and suns are sunk In Night.  
Within this hollow cavern hung  
The ready, swift and tuneful tongue.

And where &#x27;t could not praise was chained;

Or with Its envied rubies shine?  
To hew the rock, or wear the gem,  
Can little now avail to them.  
But If the page of Truth they sought,  
Or comfort to the mourner brought,  
These bands a richer meed shall claim  
Than all that wait on Wealth or Fame.

If from the bowels of Ease they tied.  
To seek aflllctlons humble shed;

man hod lost his gold snuff-box.  
There was no keeping matters quiet this  
time. The tbier must be traced and  
brought to justice. What was the wisest  
method cf procedure t What would Mr.-  
Moore suggest?  
&quot;I would suggest,&quot; though most reluct  
antly,&quot; said Mr. Moore, &quot;that every sailor  
and every sailor&#x27;s luggage be carefully  
searched.&quot;  
To this proposition we unanimously  
agreed,  
&quot;This&quot; he continncd, &quot;must be most hu  
miliating to the feelings of .-your crew,  
Captain, and, therefore, in common fair­  
ness to them as our fellowmen, let me also  
suggest that every passenger and every  
passengers&#x27; luggage be also thoroughly  
searched.&quot;  
A little hesitation on the part of one  
or two of the passengers was demonstrat­  
ed before acceding to this last proposal,  
but our pleasant passenger soon contrived  
to bring those who at first demurred to his  
side of thinking.-Of  
course,&quot; he said &quot;there is not a pas  
senger on board who is not abo  
picion, yet, injustice to the feelings of the  
crew, it is in my humble opinion, the  
best we can do.&quot;  
This delicacy of fueling and this  
thoughtfulness on the port of Reginald  
Moore rendered him, if possible, more ad­  
mirable and praiseworthy in our eyes  
than ever. ...  
Many of the crew objected strongly to  
this mode of proccedure, but all were com­  
pelled to submit. The old boatswain was  
furious with indignation, and vowed if it  
cost him his life he would trace the thief j  
who had caused him to be searched like a  
common pickpocket. Even tbe pleasant  
passenger foiled lo soothe his sense of in-  
JuEy-.. . ...  
: well, a thorough search was maaa uy  
mvself. in company with tbe kindhearted  
old gentleman and his sister. Every one&#x27;s  
traps were ransacked from top to bottom  
uritnont success. 1 j- -  
Farther search was useless. What  
was to be done ?  
That night, all having been made snug  
and the passengers having turned in,&quot; none  
of them, as you may imagine, in very bril­  
liant spirits, I went on deck, it being what  
we call at sea &quot;the captain&#x27;s watch.&quot;  
I turned in about 4 o&#x27;clock a. m the  
second officer then Doming on duty. My  
cabin was amidships and on- deck, -. and  
from a window therein I could command  
a view of the after-deck of the ship- ,  
Somehow or other, I could not rest one  
atom; so, dressing myself, I determined  
upon sitting up aad smoking. I drew  
aside the blind of the window 1 have men­  
tioned and looked out :i  
It was just the gray light of early morn  
ing, and there was a stitnsh breeze blow­  
ing. To my surprise 1 beheld Reginald  
Moore on deck.  
I was about to open my cabin door and  
invite him to loin me in my restlessness,  
when the peculiar nature of bis proceed-1  
ings riveted my attention, lie looked  
around on all sides, aa il afraid of attract  
ing observation. . &#x27;  
Then, suddenly, as if assured the coast  
was clear, be made rapidly toward the  
empty water cask, on which he was ac­  
customed to manufacture his model of the  
Janet&#x27;s Pride. Once more glancing cau  
tiously about him, he then applied his  
hands to the top of the cask, and with a  
rapid movement lifted half of the top bodi­  
ly off. ;  
My astonishment and my excitement  
Vere intense. Another hasty glance round,  
and he plunged his hand down into the  
cask, thun quickly withdrew it, holding in  
his grasp a small bag which he rapidly  
concealed in the breast of his coat.  
Again he took a hasty survey, and was  
about making another dive into this  
strange receptacle for hidden goods, when  
he suddenly withdrew, having, with aston­  
ishing rapidity, replaced the top of the  
cask. In another moment the cause of his  
alarm was made apparent, as a couple of  
sailors passed him on their way to relieve  
the man at the wheel.  
When all was again quiet for an instant  
he seemed determined tu at once return to  
the cask and no doubt withdraw something  
mora that the interruption had prevented  
him withdrawing in the first instance. But  
suddenly changing bis mind, be went  
down the stairs that led from the deck to  
the saloon and sleeping cabins.  
Scarcely had he disappeared when an  
other figure, stealthy crossing the deck.  
met my anxious OJaervotiou, it was tne  
boatswain.  
I saw him glance toward the stairs down  
which Reginald Moore bad taken, his de­  
parture. Ha then made direct for the  
water-cask. It was now obvious to me  
that the old boatswain had been watching  
the pleasant passenger. - &#x27;  
Just as he reached the water-cask a  
heavy green sea struck the ship to wind­  
ward, necessitating the boatswain to hold  
on by the ropes sa as to keep his footing.  
and precisely at tne same moment iteginaiu  
Moore appeared at the top of the cabin  
stairs.&#x27; I shall neyer forget the scene.  
The Instant the ship bad steadied her  
self the boatswain commenced bis exam­  
ination of the water-cask.. For a moment  
only, Moore stood looking at him with as  
evil an expression- on his lace as I ever  
beheld. &#x27; &#x27;  
With one bound he was upon the boit,  
swain before he could turn to protect him­  
self. L waited no longer, but flung open  
the door of my cabin in an instant, and  
in another I was to tne rescue, mnu ui a  
few momenta we bad our pleasant pas­  
senger in irons. .-.. . .  
ao, you see, ne was tne uu mui ti,  
hiding his knavery under the pleasantest  
exterior I ever knew a man to possess,  
The manner in which be had manufac­  
tured the top of that water-cask was tbe  
most finished and ingenious piece of car­  
peutry I have ever beheld. . t  
In the interior of the side of the- cask,  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from tbe top, on which be bad sus  
  
pended, in wash-leather bags, the jew  
  
elry he hail stolen.  
You may easily imagine the surprise  
evinced by our passengers on discovering  
that the tuict was tne man tor wnom cacu  
and every one entertained such regard  
and even affection.  
At the expiration of three days from the  
date of the pleasant passenger&#x27;s detection  
we landed in Melbourne, where duty  
compelled me to hand bim over to the  
police : but t.8 no one eared to remain in  
that town for the purpose of prosecuting

in the way of jewelry than anyone on I  
board, since £1,500 had never pur- j  
chased what they possessed.  
Tbe whole of that evening was oc­  
cupied in speculating as to tbe prob­  
able perpetrator of the the ft, and in  
condoling with Reginald Moore on  
bis great loss.  
Every one turned in that night in  
an uneasy state of mind, and it was  
with astonishment that they found  
themselves in the morning still in  
full possession of all their worldly  
goods. This improved condition of  
affairs seemed to reassure our pas­  
sengers, who at once began to look  
cheerful aud at ease.  
Reginald Moore’s pleasant face  
wore its wonted smile, and, as here­  
tofore, he enlivened and charmed us  
with his vivacity and anecdote. All  
day through he worked on tbe model  
of lhe Janet’s Pride, still using the  
top of the empty water-cask for a  
work-table.  
That night we retired to rest with  
minds far more at ease than the pre­  
vious one. Alas! what a sense of  
anger and distress came with the  
morning! Every passenger on board  
possessing jewelry had been robbed  
during the night.  
The three old gentlemen, tbe  
young married c &gt;uple , and the kiud­  
bearted brother mid sister, found  
themselves minus every ariicnl ot  
jewelry that they had possessed.  
Even the grumbling old gentlemen  
bad lost bis geld snuffbox.  
There was no keeping matters  
quiet this time. £ho thiet must be  
traced and brought to justice. What  
was-the wisest method of procedure?  
What would Mr. Moore suggest?  
‘I would suggest, though, most re­  
luctantly that every sailor and every  
sailor’s luggage be earefuly searched.’  
To this proposition we unanimous­  
ly agreed.  
• L’his,’ be continued, ‘nitist be most  
humiliating to the feelings of your  
crew, captain, and therefore, in com  
mon fairness to them as our fellow­  
men, let me suggest that every pass­  
enger’s luggage bo uho thoroughly  
searched.’  
A little hesitation on the part of  
one or two of tho passengers was  
demonstrated before acceding to ibis  
prt posal but one pleasant passenger  
soon contrived t &gt; bring those who  
at first domu.red to his side of  
thinking.  
“Of course,” he said, “there is not  
a passenger on board that is not  
above suspicion, yet in justice to the  
feelings ofthe crew, it is in my hum­  
ble opinion the least that we can  
do.”  
This delicacy of feeling and this  
thoughtfulness on the part of Regin­  
ald Moore, rendered him if possible,  
more admirable and praiseworthy in  
our eyes than ever.  
Many of the crew objected strong- i  
ly to this mode of proceedure but all i  
were compelled to submit The old  
boatswain was furious with indigna­  
tion, and vowed that if it cost him  
his life he would trace the thief who )  
had caused him to be searched like !  
a common pick pocket. Even the i  
pleasant passenger failed to soothe 1  
his sense of injury.  
Well, a thorough examination was  
made by myself in company with the  
kind-hearted old gentleman his sis­  
ter. Every one&#x27;s traps were ransack-,  
ed from top to bottom without sue­  
cess.  
Further search was useless. What  
was to be done ?  
That night all having been made  
snug and the passengers having I  
turned in, none of them, as you may ,  
imagine, in very brilliant spirits, 1  
went on deck, it being what we call ■  
at sea “the captain’s watch.”  
I turned in about 4 o’clock a. m., ’  
tho second officer then coming on  
duty. My cabin was amidships and  
| on deck, and from the window there  
: in I could command a view of lhe af­  
ter deck of the ship.  
Somehow or other I could not rest  
; one atom; so, dressing myself I de­  
, termined on sitting up and smoking. |  
I drew aside the blind of the window ,  
I have mentioned and looked out.  
It was just the gray light of early |  
morning and there was a stiffish j  
breeze blowing. To my surprise I be- I  
held Reginald Moore on deck.  
I was about to open my cabin I  
door and invite him to join me in my |  
restlessness when the peculiar nature  
iof his proceedings riveted my atten- ;  
tion. He looked around on all sides,  
, as if afraid of attracting observation.  
Then, suddenly, as if atsured the  
■ coast was clear, he made rapidly to­  
ward the empty water cask, on !  
which he was accustomed to manti- &#x27;  
facture his model of Janet’s Pride.  
Once more glancing cautiously about  
him, lie then applied his hands to the  
, top of the cask and with a rapid  
movement lifted half the top bodily ;  
off.  
My astonishment and my excite- ■

glat.ee round and he plunged his  
hand down into the cask, then quick- &#x27;  
ly withdrew it, holding in his grasp !  
a small bag u hich he rapidly con- I  
i cealed in the breast of his coat.  
Ag in he tc&gt;.k a hasty survey, and  
was about to make another dive into &#x27;  
this strange receptacle for hidden  
goods when he suddenly withdrew, j  
having with astonishing rapidity re­  
placed the top of tbe cask. In an- ■  
other moment tbe cause of his alarm 1  
was made apparent as a couple of  
sailors passed him on their way to  
relieve the man at the wheel.  
When all was again quiet for an  
I instant he seemed determined to re­  
turn to the cask and no doubt with- j  
! draw something more that the inter- j  
ruption had prevented him with­  
drawing in tbe first instance. But, ■  
suddenly changing his mind, he j  
went down the stairs that led to the !  
saloon and sleeping cabins.  
Scarcely had he disappear* I when i  
another figure, stealthily crossing 1  
the deck, met my anxious observa  
j tion. It was tbe boatswain.  
I saw him glance toward the  
stairs down which Reginald Moore  
I had taken his departure. He then  
made lor the water cask. It was obvi­  
ous to ine that lhe old boatswain had  
been watching our pleasant passen­  
ger-  
Just as he reached the water cask  
a heavy g een sea struck the ship to  
windward necessitating tho  
boatswain to hold on by lhe ropes, so  
I at to keep his footing, and precisely  
at the same moment Reginald Moore  
appeared at lhe top of lhe cabin  
stairs. I shall never forget the scene.  
The iristant the ship had steadied  
herself the boatswain commenced  
his examination of the water cask  
For a moment only Moore stood  
looking at him with as evil an ex-  
  
pression on his face as I ever beheld.  
With one bound he was upon the  
boatswain before he could turn to  
protect himself. I waited no longer,  
but Hung open lhe door of my cabin  
in an instant and in another I was to  
the rescue aud in a few minutes we  
had our pleasant passenger in irons.  
So, you see, he was lhe thief after  
&#x27; all, hiding his knavery under the  
i pleasantest exterior I ever knew a  
i man to possess. The manner in  
which he bad manufactured the top  
of lhe cask was the most finished and  
ingenious piece of carpentry I ever  
beheld.  
In the interior of the side  
of the cask he had driven sever­  
al nails, about two feet from the lop,  
on which he had suspended in wash  
leather bags, the jewelry he had sto­  
len.  
You nay easily imagine the sur­  
prise evinced by our passengers on  
discovering that the thief was the  
man for whom each and every one  
entertained such regard and even af­  
fection.  
At the expiration of three days  
from the date ofthe pleasant passen­  
ger’s detection, we landed in Mel­  
bourne where duty compelled me to  
hand him over to the police; but as  
no one cared fi remain jn that town  
for the purpose of prosecuting him  
he was summarily dealt with. The  
presiding magistrate sentenced him

old gentleman and his sister. Every one&#x27;s  
traps were ransacked irom top to bottom,  
but without success.  
Further search was useless. What was  
to be done?  
That night, all having been made snug,  
and the passengers having turned in, none  
of them, as you imagine, in very fine  
spirits, I went on deck, it being what we  
call at sea, &quot; the captain&#x27;s watch.&quot;  
1 turned in about lour o clock in the  
morning, the second officer then coming  
on duty. My cabin was amidships and ou  
deck, aud from a window therein I could  
command a view of the afterdeck of the  
ship.  
Somehow or other I could not rest one  
atom ; so, dressing myself, I determined  
upon sitting up nnd smoking. I drew  
aside the blind of tbe window I have  
mentioned and looked out.  
It was just the gray light of early  
morning, and there was a stillish breeze  
blowing. To my surprise I beheld Regi  
nald Moore on the deck.  
I was about to open my cabin door and  
invito him to join me in my restlessness,  
when tho peculiar nature ot bis proceed  
ings riveted my attention. He looked  
around on all sides, as if afraid of attract­  
ing attention.  
Then suddenly, as if assured tbe coast  
was clear, be made rapidly toward the  
empty water cask, on which he was ac  
customed to manufacture his model of tbe  
Janet&#x27;s Pride. Once more glancing cau  
tiously about him, he then applied his  
hands to the top of the cask, and with a  
rapid movement lifted half of the top  
bodily off.  
Aly astonishment and my excitement  
were intense. Another hasty glance  
round, and he plunged his band down into  
the cask, then quickly withdrew it, holding  
in his grasp a small bag, which he rapidly  
concealed in the breast of his coat.  
Again he took a hasty survey, and was  
tbotit to make another dive into this  
strange receptacle for hidden goods, when  
ho suddenly withdrew, having, with as­  
tonishing rapidity, replaced the top of the  
cask. In another moment the cause of  
his alarm was made apparent, as a couple  
of sailors passed him on their way to re  
lieve the men at tne wheel.  
When all was ag tin quiet for an instant  
he seemed determined to at once return to  
the cask, and no doubt withdraw some­  
thing moro that the interruption had pre­  
vented him from withdrawing at the first  
instance. But suddenly changing his  
mind, he wont down llio stairs that led  
from Ihe deck to the salo iu and sleeping  
cabins.  
Scarcely had ho disappeared when  
another figure stealthily crossing the deck,  
met my anxious observation. It was the  
boatswain.  
I saw hiiu glance toward the stairs down  
which Reginald Moore had taken his de  
parture. Ho then mado direct tor the  
water caske. It was now obvious to mo  
that the old boatswain had been watching  
the pleasant passenger.  
Just as he reached tlio water cask a  
lioavy green sea struck the ship to wind­  
ward, necessitating the boatswain to hold  
on by the ropes so as to keep his footing,  
and precisely at the same moment Regi  
nald Moore appeared at the top of Ihe  
cabin stairs. I shall never forget tbe  
scene.  
Tbe Instant the ship had steadied her-  
solf the boatswain commenced his exami  
nation of the water-cask. For a moment  
only Moore stood looking at bim with as  
evil an expression on his face at I ever be  
held.  
Wilh one bound he was upon the boats­  
wain before he could turn to protect him  
self. I waited no longer, but flung open  
the door of my cabin in an instant, and in  
another I was to tbe resoue, and in a few  
moments we had our pleasant passenger  
in irons.  
So, vou see, he was the thief, after all.  
hiding his knavery under tbe ploasantest  
exterior I ever know a man to possess.  
The manner in which he had manufactur­  
ed the top of that water-cask was the  
most finished and ingenious piece of  
carpentry I have ever behold.  
In the interior of the side of the cask  
he had driven several nails, about two  
feet from the top, on which he had bus­  
pended.in wash-leather bags, the jewelry  
he had stolen.  
You may easily imagine the surprise  
evinced by our passengers on discovering  
tnat tne thiol was tne man lor wliom each  
and every one entertained such regard and  
even affection.  
At the expiration of three days from the  
date of the pleasant passenger&#x27;s&#x27; detection.  
we landed in Melbourne, whore duty com­  
pelled me to hand him over to the police;  
but as no one oared to remain in that town  
for tbe purpose of prosoouting bim, he  
was summarily dealt with. The presid­  
ing magistrate sentenoed him to sis  
months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labor.

Once shone the bright and busy eye;  
But start not at the dismal void  
If social love that eye employed;  
If with no lawless fires it gleamed,  
But through the dew of kindness  
beamed,  
That eye shall be forever bright  
When stars and suns have lost their  
light.  
Here in this silent eavern hung  
The ready, swift and tuneful tongun;  
If falschood&#x27;s honey is disdained,  
And where it could not praise was  
chained;  
If bold in virtue&#x27;s cause it spoke,  
Yet gentle concord never broke,  
That tuneful tongue shall plead for
