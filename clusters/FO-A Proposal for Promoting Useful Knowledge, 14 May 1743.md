 all Lovers of Useful Knowledge.”  
  
A PROPOSAL for Promoting Useful Knowledge among the British Plantations in America.  
Philadelphia, May 14, 1743.  
  
The English are possess’d of a long Tract of Continent, from Nova Scotia to Georgia, extending North and South thro’ different Climates, having different Soils, producing different Plants, Mines and Minerals, and capable of different Improvements, Manufactures, &amp;c.  
The first Drudgery of Settling new Colonies, which confines the Attention of People to mere Necessaries, is now pretty well over; and there are many in every Province in Circumstances that set them at Ease, and afford Leisure to cultivate the finer Arts, and improve the common Stock of Knowledge. To such of these who are Men of Speculation, many Hints must from time to time arise, many Observations occur, which if well-examined, pursued and improved, might produce Discoveries to the Advantage of some or all of the British Plantations, or to the Benefit of Mankind in general.  
  
But as from the Extent of the Country such Persons are widely separated, and seldom can see and converse or be acquainted with each other, so that many useful Particulars remain uncommunicated, die with the Discoverers, and are lost to Mankind; it is, to remedy this Inconvenience for the future, proposed,  
That One Society be formed of Virtuosi or ingenious Men residing in the several Colonies, to be called The American Philosophical Society; who are to maintain a constant Correspondence.  
That Philadelphia being the City nearest the Centre of the Continent-Colonies, communicating with all of them northward and southward by Post, and with all the Islands by Sea, and having the Advantage of a good growing Library, be the Centre of the Society.  
That at Philadelphia there be always at least seven Members, viz. a Physician, a Botanist, a Mathematician, a Chemist, a Mechanician, a Geographer, and a general Natural Philosopher, besides a President, Treasurer and Secretary.  
That these Members meet once a Month, or oftner, at their own Expence, to communicate to each other their Observations, Experiments, &amp;c. to receive, read and consider such Letters, Communications, or Queries as shall be sent from distant Members; to direct the Dispersing of Copies of such Communications as are valuable, to other distant Members, in order to procure their Sentiments thereupon, &amp;c.  
That the Subjects of the Correspondence be, All new-discovered Plants, Herbs, Trees, Roots, &amp;c. their Virtues, Uses, &amp;c. Methods of Propagating them, and making such as are useful, but particular to some Plantations, more general. Improvements of vegetable Juices, as Cyders, Wines, &amp;c. New Methods of Curing or Preventing Diseases. All new-discovered Fossils in different Countries, as Mines, Minerals, Quarries, &amp;c. New and useful Improvements in any Branch of Mathematicks. New Discoveries in Chemistry, such as Improvements in Distillation, Brewing, Assaying of Ores, &amp;c. New Mechanical Inventions for saving Labour; as Mills, Carriages, &amp;c. and for Raising and Conveying of Water, Draining of Meadows, &amp;c. All new Arts, Trades, Manufactures, &amp;c. that may be proposed or thought of. Surveys, Maps and Charts of particular Parts of the Sea-coasts, or Inland Countries; Course and Junction of Rivers and great Roads, Situation of Lakes and Mountains, Nature of the Soil and Productions, &amp;c. New Methods of Improving the Breed of useful Animals, Introducing other Sorts from foreign Countries. New Improvements in Planting, Gardening, Clearing Land, &amp;c. And all philosophical Experiments that let Light into the Nature of Things, tend to increase the Power of Man over Matter, and multiply the Conveniencies or Pleasures of Life.  
That a Correspondence already begun by some intended Members, shall be kept up by this Society with the Royal Society of London, and with the Dublin Society.  
That every Member shall have Abstracts sent him Quarterly, of every Thing valuable communicated to the Society’s Secretary at Philadelphia; free of all Charge except the Yearly Payment hereafter mentioned.  
That by Permission of the Postmaster-General, such Communications pass between the Secretary of the Society and the Members, Postage-free.  
That for defraying the Expence of such Experiments as the Society shall judge proper to cause to be made, and other contingent Charges for the common Good, every Member send a Piece of Eight per Annum to the Treasurer, at Philadelphia, to form a Common Stock, to be disburs’d by Order of the President with the Consent of the Majority of the Members that can conveniently be consulted thereupon, to such Persons and Places where and by whom the Experiments are to be made, and otherwise as there shall be Occasion; of which Disbursements an exact Account shall be kept, and communicated yearly to every Member.  
That at the first Meetings of the Members at Philadelphia, such Rules be formed for Regulating their Meetings and Transactions for the General Benefit, as shall be convenient and necessary; to be afterwards changed and improv’d as there shall be Occasion, wherein due Regard is to be had to the Advice of distant Members.  
That at the End of every Year, Collections be made and printed, of such Experiments, Discoveries, Improvements, &amp;c. as may be thought of publick Advantage: And that every Member have a Copy sent him.  
That the Business and Duty of the Secretary be, To receive all Letters intended for the Society, and lay them before the President and Members at their Meetings; to abstract, correct and methodize such Papers, &amp;c. as require it, and as he shall be directed to do by the President, after they have been considered, debated and digested in the Society; to enter Copies thereof in the Society’s Books, and make out Copies for distant Members; to answer their Letters by Direction of the President, and keep Records of all material Transactions of the Society, &amp;c.  
Benjamin Franklin, the Writer of this Proposal, offers himself to serve the Society as their Secretary, ’till they shall be provided with one more capable.

Dr. Franklin’s circular is entitled “ A proposal for promoting use-  
ful knowledge among the British Plantations in America.” It com-  
mences by speaking of the great extent of the colonial possessions,  
“having different climates and different soils, producing different  
plants, mines, and minerals, and capable of different improvements,  
manufactures,” &amp;c.  
  
It then says: “ The first drudgery of settling new colonies, which  
confines the attention of people to mere necessaries, is now pretty  
well over; and there are many in every province in circumstances  
that set them at ease, and afford leisure to cultivate the finer arts,  
and improve the common stock of knowledge. To such of these  
who are men of speculation, many hints must from time to time arise,  
many observations occur, which if well examined, pursued, and im-  
  
proved, might produce discoveries to the advantage of some or all of  
  
the British Plantations, or to the benefit of mankind in general. . . .  
But as, from the extent of the country, such persons are widely sepa-  
rated, and seldom can see and converse or be acquainted with each

other, so that many useful particulars remain uncommunicated, die  
with the discoverers, and are lost to mankind; it is to remedy this  
inconvenience for the future, proposed,—  
  
‘“‘ That one society be formed of virtuosi, or ingenious men, resid-  
ing in the several colonies, to be called The American Philosophical  
Society, who are to maintain constant correspondence.  
  
“ That Philadelphia, being the city nearest to the centre of the con-  
tinent colonies, communicating with ail of them northward and south-  
ward by post, and with all the islands by sea, and having the advan-  
tage of a good growing library, be the centre of the Society.  
  
“That at Philadelphia there be always at least seven members,  
viz. a physician, a botanist, a mathematician, a chemist, a mechani-  
cian, a geographer, and a general natural philosopher, besides a pre-  
sident, treasurer, and secretary.  
  
“ That these members meet once a month, or oftener, at their own  
expense, to communicate to each other their observations and expe-  
riments; to receive, read, and consider such letters, communications,  
or queries as shall be sent from distant members; to direct the dis-  
persing of the copies of such communications as are valuable, to other  
distant members, in order to procure their sentiments thereupon.”  
  
Then follows an enumeration, made with some detail, of the sub-  
jects on which it was proposed that the Society should be occupied :  
including investigations in botany; in medicine; in mineralogy and  
mining; in mathematics; in chemistry; in mechanics; in arts, trades,  
and manufactures; in geography and topography; in agriculture;  
and “all philosophical experiments that let light into the nature of  
things, tend to increase the power of man over matter, and multiply  
the conveniences or pleasures of life.”

the communications be sent quarterly to all the members ; and “that,  
at the end of every year, collections be made and printed of such  
experiments, discoveries, and improvements, as may be thought of  
public advantage.”  
  
The duties of the secretary are particularly laid down, and they  
are very arduous; requiring that he attend to all the correspondence,  
  
“abstract, correct, and methodize such papers as require it, and as  
  
he shall be directed to do by the president, after they have been con-  
  
sidered, debated, and digested in the Society ; to enter copies thereof  
  
in the Society’s books, and make out copies for distant members.”

And after enumerating these difficult duties, the circular closes by  
saying :—

serve the Society as their Secretary, till they shall be provided with  
one more capable.”

for the use of the said city.  
  
On the 28th February, 1780, the General Assembly of the Com-  
monwealth vested the State-house, and the whole lot between Walnut  
and Chestnut and Fifth and Sixth Streets, in the Commonwealth, to  
the uses and trusts theretofore appointed and limited. The legal  
title was therefore in the State of Pennsylvania. From a club called  
the Junto, originated in 1727, by Benjamin Franklin, sprung a pro-  
position to form a society composed of virtuosi or ingenious men re-  
siding in the several colonies, to be called The American Philosophical  
Society, to be held at Philadelphia, being the city nearest to the centre  
of the continent colonies, communicating with all of them northward
