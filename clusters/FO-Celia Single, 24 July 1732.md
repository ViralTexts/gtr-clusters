Mr. Gazetteer,  
I must needs tell you, that some of the Things you print do more Harm than Good; particularly I think so of my Neighbour the Tradesman’s Letter in one of your late Papers, which has broken the Peace of several Families, by causing Difference between Men and their Wives: I shall give you here one Instance, of which I was an Eye and Ear Witness.  
Happening last Wednesday Morning to be in at Mrs. C——ss’s, when her Husband return’d from Market, among other Things which he had bought, he show’d her some Balls of Thread. My Dear, says he, I like mightily those Stockings which I yesterday saw Neighbour Afterwit knitting for her Husband, of Thread of her own Spinning: I should be glad to have some such Stockins my self: I understand that your Maid Mary is a very good Knitter, and seeing this Thread in Market, I have bought it, that the Girl may make a Pair or two for me. Mrs. Careless was just then at the Glass, dressing her Head; and turning about with the Pins in her Mouth, Lord, Child, says she, are you crazy? What Time has Mary to knit? Who must do the Work, I wonder, if you set her to Knitting? Perhaps, my Dear, says he, you have a mind to knit ’em yourself; I remember, when I courted you, I once heard you say you had learn’d to knit of your Mother. I knit Stockins for you, says she, not I truly; There are poor Women enough in Town, that can knit; if you please you may employ them. Well, but my Dear, says he, you know a penny sav’d is a penny got, a pin a day is a groat a year, every little makes a mickle, and there is neither Sin nor Shame in Knitting a pair of Stockins; why should you express such a mighty Aversion to it? As to poor Women, you know we are not People of Quality, we have no Income to maintain us, but what arises from my Labour and Industry; methinks you should not be at all displeas’d, if you have an Opportunity to get something as well as myself. I wonder, says she, how you can propose such a thing to me; did not you always tell me you would maintain me like a Gentlewoman? If I had married Capt. ——, he would have scorn’d even to mention Knitting of Stockins. Prithee, says he, (a little nettled) what do you tell me of your Captains? If you could have had him, I suppose you would; or perhaps you did not very well like him: If I did promise to maintain you like a Gentlewoman, I suppose ’tis time enough for that when you know how to behave like one; mean while ’tis your Duty to help make me able. How long d’ye think I can maintain you at your present Rate of Living? Pray, says she, (somewhat fiercely, and dashing the Puff into the Powder-Box) don’t use me after this Manner, for I assure you I won’t bear it. This is the Fruit of your poison News-papers; there shall come no more here, I promise you. Bless us, says he, what an unaccountable thing is this! Must a Tradesman’s Daughter, and the Wife of a Tradesman, necessarily and instantly be a Gentlewoman? You had no Portion; I am forc’d to work for a Living; if you are too great to do the like, there’s the Door, go and live upon your Estate, if you can find it, in short, I don’t desire to be troubled w’ye. —— What Answer she made, I cannot tell; for knowing that a Man and his Wife are apt to quarrel more violently when before Strangers, than when by themselves, I got up and went out hastily: But I understood from Mary, who came to me of an Errand in the Evening, that they dined together pretty peaceably, (the Balls of Thread that had caused the Difference, being thrown into the Kitchen Fire) of which I was very glad to hear.  
I have several times in your Paper seen severe Reflections upon us Women, for Idleness and Extravagance, but I do not remember to have once seen any such Animadversions upon the Men. If I were dispos’d to be censorious, I could furnish you with Instances enough: I might mention Mr. Billiard, who spends more than he earns, at the Green Table; and would have been in Jail long since, were it not for his industrious Wife: Mr. Husselcap, who often all day long leaves his Business for the rattling of Halfpence in a certain Alley: Mr. Finikin, who has seven different Suits of fine Cloaths, and wears a Change every Day, while his Wife and Children sit at home half naked: Mr. Crownhim, who is always dreaming over the Chequer-board, and cares not how the World goes, so he gets the Game: Mr. T’otherpot the Tavern-haunter; Mr. Bookish, the everlasting Reader; Mr. Tweedledum, Mr. Toot-a-toot, and several others, who are mighty diligent at any thing beside their Business. I say, if I were dispos’d to be censorious, I might mention all these, and more; but I hate to be thought a Scandalizer of my Neighbours, and therefore forbear. And for your part, I would advise you, for the future, to entertain your Readers with something else besides People’s Reflections upon one another; for remember, that there are Holes enough to be pick’d in your Coat as well as others; and those that are affronted by the Satyrs you may publish, will not consider so much who wrote, as who printed: Take not this Freedom amiss, from Your Friend and Reader,

LETTER FROM CELIA SINGLE.  
  
Mr. Gazetteer,—I must needs tell you that some of  
the things you print do more harm than good, particu-  
larly I think so of the tradesman’s letter, which was in  
one of your late papers, which disobliged many of our  
sex and has broken the peace of several families, by  
causing difference between men and their wives. I  
shall give you here one instance of which I was an eye  
and ear witness,  
  
Happening last Wednesday morning to be at Mrs.  
W.’s when her husband returned from market, among  
other things he showed her some balls of thread which  
he had bought. My dear, says he, I like mightily those  
stockings which I yesterday saw neighbor Afterwit  
knitting for her husband, of thread of her own spinning.  
I should be glad to have some such stockings myself.  
{ understand that your maid Mary is a very good  
knitter, and seeing this thread in market I have bought  
it that the girl may make a pair or two for me. Mrs.  
W. was just then at the glass dressing her head, and  
turning about with the pins in her mouth, Lord, child,  
says she, are you crazy ? What time has Mary to knit?  
Who must do the work, | wonder, if you set her to  
knitting ? Perhaps, my dear, says he, you have a mind  
to knit them yourself. I remember, when I courted  
you, I once heard you say that you had learned to knit  
of your mother. 1 knit stockings for you, says she, not  
I, truly! There are poor women enough in town who  
can knit; if you please you may employ them. Well,  
but my dear, says he, you know a penny saved is a  
penny got, and there is neither sin nor shame in knit-  
ting a pair of stockings ; why should you have sucha  
mighty aversion to it? And what signifies talking of  
poor women, you know we are not people of quality.  
We have no income to maintain us but arises from my  
labor and industry. Methinks you should not be at  
all displeased when you have an opportunity of getting  
something as well as myself. I wonder, says she, you  
can propose such a thing tome. Did not you always  
tell me you would maintain me like a gentlewoman ?  
If | had married the Captain I am sure he would have  
scorned to mention knitting of stockings. Prythee,  
says he, a little nettled, what do you tell me of your  
Captain? If you could have had him I suppose you  
would, or perhaps you did not like him very well. If  
I did promise to maintain you as a gentlewoman, me-  
thinks it is time enough for that when you know how  
to behave yourself like one. How long, do you think,  
1 can maintain you at your present rate of living?  
Pray, says she, somewhat fiercely, and dashing the  
puff into the powder box, dont use me in this manner,  
for Pll assure you [ wont bear it. This is the fruit of  
your poison newspapers: there shall no more come  
here 1 promise you. Bless us, says he, what an unac-  
countable thing is this? Must a tradesman’s daughter  
and the wife of a tradesman necessarily be a lady? In  
short, I tell you if I am forced to work for a living and  
you are too good to do the like, there’s the door, go  
and live upon your estate. And asI never had or could  
expect any thing with you, I dont desire to be troubled  
with you.  
  
What answer she made I cannot tell, for knowing  
that man and wife are apt to quarrel more violently  
when before strangers, than when by themselves, I got  
  
up and went out hastily. But I understand from Mary  
who came to me of an errand in the evening, that they  
dined together very peaceably and lovingly, the batts  
of thread which had caused the disturbance being  
thrown into the kitchen fire, of which I was very glad  
to hear.  
  
1 have several times in your paper seen reflections  
upon us women for idleness and extravagance, but I do  
not remember to have once seen such animadversions  
upon the men. If we were disposed to be censorious  
we could furnish you with instances enough; I might  
mention Mr. Billiard who loses more than he earns at  
the green table, and would have been in jail long since  
had it not been for his industrious wife. Mr. Hussel-  
cap, who every market day at least, and often all day  
long, leaves his business for the rattling of half pence  
ina certain alley—or Mr. Finikin, who has seven dif-  
ferent suits of fine clothes and wears a change every  
day, while his wife and children sit at home half naked  
—Mr. Crownhim always dreaming over the chequer  
board, and who cares not how the world goes with his  
family so he does but get the game—Mr. Totherpot the  
tavern haunter, Mr. Bookish the everlasting reader,  
Mr. Tweedledum and several others, who are mighty  
diligent at any thing besides their proper business. I  
say, if I were disposed to be censorious, I might men-  
tion all these and more, but I hate to be thought a  
scandalizer of my neighbors, and therefore forbear; and  
for your part I would advise you for the future to enter-  
tain your readers with something else besides people’s  
refiections upon one another, for remember that there  
are holes enough to be picked in your coat as well as  
others, and those that are affronted by the satires that  
you may publish, will not consider so much who wrote  
as who printed, and treat you accordingly. ‘Take not  
this freedom amiss from  
  
Your friend and reader,
