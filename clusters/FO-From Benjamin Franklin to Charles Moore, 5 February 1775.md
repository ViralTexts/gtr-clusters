I duly received your Favour of Dec. 7. with a Copy of the Resolution of the House appointing me Agent for the current Year; and the printed Votes. I am oblig’d by your Care in sending them so expeditiously.  
A Friend of mine, Lord Le Despencer, has lately erected at Wyecomb his fine Country Seat, a noble Statue of William Penn, our Founder; holding in its hand a Scroll on which is the enclos’d Inscription in gold Letters. I think such a Statue would well become a Niche in some Part of the Statehouse next the Garden. It might be had for about £50. I am, with much Esteem, Your most obedient Servant

mine, Lord Le De Spencer, has laately crected at Wycomb,  
his fine country seat, a noble statue of William Penn, our  
founder, holding in his hand a scroll, on which is the en  
closed inscription, in gold letters. I think such a statue  
would well become a niche in some part of the State House,
