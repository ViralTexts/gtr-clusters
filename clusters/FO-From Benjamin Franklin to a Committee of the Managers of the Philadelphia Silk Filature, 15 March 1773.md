In mine of Feb. 10. I mentioned a Silk weaver who was desirous of going to America; and endeavouring to get Subscriptions among his Friends to defray the Expence of his and Family’s Passage. He now tells me they have been so kind as to double the Sum he requested, and that he is to go in Sutton. He takes with him a good Certificate from the Meeting; and I beg leave to recommend him to the Notice and Encouragement of the Silk Committee, as far as they may find him deserving. For tho’ it may be most advantageous for our Country, while the Bounty continues so high, to send all our raw Silk hither; yet as the Bounty will gradually diminish and at length cease, I should think it not amiss to begin early the laying a Foundation for the future Manufacture of it; and perhaps this Person, if he finds Employment, may be a means of raising Hands for that purpose. His Name is Joseph Clark.  
By the enclos’d you will see when the Silk will probably be sold. I hope to send you a good Account of it; and am, with great Esteem, Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Se

*“ GENTLEMEN: Inmine of Feb. 10 I men-  
tioned a Silk Weaver who was desirous of  
going to America, and endeavoring to get  
subscriptions among his friends to defray the  
expense of his and family’s passage. He now  
tells me they have been so kind as to double  
the sum he requested, and that he is to go  
in Sutton. He takes with him a good certifi-  
cate from the Meeting; and I beg leave to  
recommend him to the notice and encourage-  
ment of the silk committee, as far as they  
may find him deserving. For though it may  
be most advantageous to our country while  
the bounty continues so high to send all our  
raw silk hither; yet as the bounty will grad-  
ually diminish and at length cease, I should  
think it not amiss to begin early the laying a  
foundation for the future manufacture of it;  
and perhaps this person, if he finds employ-  
ment, may be a means of raising hands for  
that purpose. His name is Joseph Clark.  
  
“‘ By the enclosed you will see when the silk  
will probably be sold. I hope to send you a  
good account of it, andam, with great esteem,  
Gentlemen, your most obt. Humb. sert
