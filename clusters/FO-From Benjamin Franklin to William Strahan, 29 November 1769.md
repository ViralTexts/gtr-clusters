Dear Sir,  
Craven Street, Nov. 29. 69  
Being just return’d to Town from a little Excursion I find yours of the 22d, containing a Number of Queries that would require a Pamphlet to answer them fully. You however desire only brief Answers, which I shall endeavour to give you. Previous to your Queries, You tell me, that “you apprehend his Majesty’s Servants have now in Contemplation; 1st. to releive the Colonists from the Taxes complained of: and 2dly to preserve the Honour, the Dignity, and the Supremacy of the British Legislature over all his Majesty’s Dominions.” I hope your Information is good, and that what you suppose to be in Contemplation will be carried into Execution, by repealing all the Laws that have been made for raising a Revenue in America by Authority of Parliament, without the consent of the People there. The Honour and Dignity of the British Legislature will not be hurt by such an Act of Justice and Wisdom: The wisest Councils are liable to be misled, especially in Matters remote from their Inspection. It is the persisting in an Error, not the Correcting it that lessens the Honour of any Man or body of Men. The Supremacy of that Legislature, I believe will be best preserv’d by making a very sparing use of it, never but for the Evident Good of the Colonies themselves, or of the whole British Empire; never for the Partial Advantage of Britain to their Prejudice; by such Prudent Conduct I imagine that Supremacy may be gradually strengthened and in time fully Established; but otherwise I apprehend it will be disputed, and lost in the Dispute. At present the Colonies consent and Submit to it for the regulation of General Commerce: But a Submission to Acts of Parliament was no part of their original Constitution. Our former Kings Governed their Colonies, as they Governed their Dominions in France, without the Participation of British Parliaments. The Parliament of England never presum’d to interfere with that prerogative till the Time of the Great Rebellion, when they usurp’d the Government of all the King’s other Dominions, Ireland, Scotland &amp;c. The Colonies that held for the King, they conquered by Force of Arms, and Governed afterward as Conquered Countries. But New England having not oppos’d the Parliament, was considered and treated as a Sister Kingdom in Amity with England; as appears by the Journals, Mar. 10. 1642.  
Your first Question is,  
1. “Will not a Repeal of all the Duties (that on Tea excepted, which was before paid here on Exportation, and of Course no new Imposition) fully satisfy the Colonists?”  
I think not.  
“2 Your Reasons for that Opinion?”  
Because it is not the Sum paid in that Duty on Tea that is Complain’d of as a Burthen, but the Principle of the Act express’d in the Preamble, viz. that those Duties were laid for the Better Support of Government and the Administration of Justice in the Colonies. This the Colonists think unnecessary, unjust, and dangerous to their Most Important Rights. Unnecessary, because in all the Colonies (two or three new ones excepted) Government and the Administration of Justice were and always had been well supported without any Charge to Britain; Unjust as it made such Colonies liable to pay such Charge for other Colonies, in which they had no Concern or Interest; dangerous, as such a Mode of raising Money for these Purposes, tended to render their Assemblies useless: For if a Revenue could be rais’d in the Colonies for all the purposes of Government, by Act of Parliament, without Grants from the People there, Governors, who do not generally love Assemblies, would never call them, they would be laid aside; and when nothing Should depend upon the People’s good will to Government, their Rights would be trampled on, they would be treated with Contempt. Another Reason why I think they would not be satisfy’d with such a partial repeal, is, that their Agreements not to import till the Repeal takes place, include the whole, which shows that they object to the whole; and those Agreements will continue binding on them if the whole is not repealed.  
“3. Do you think the only effectual Way of composing the present Differences, is, to put the Americans precisely in the Situation they were in before the passing of the late Stamp Act?”  
I think so.  
“4. Your Reasons for that Opinion?”  
Other Methods have been tryed. They have been rebuked in angry Letters. Their Petitions have been refused or rejected by Parliament. They have been threatened with the Punishments of Treason by Resolves of both Houses. Their Assemblies have been dissolv’d, and Troops have been sent among them; but all these Ways have only exasperated their Minds and widen’d the Breach; their Agreements to use no more British Manufactures have been Strengthen’d, and these Measures instead of composing Differences and promoting a good Correspondence, have almost annihilated your Commerce with those Countries, and greatly endanger’d the National Peace and general Welfare.  
“5. If this last Method is deemed by the Legislature and his Majisty’s Ministers to be repugnant to their Duty as Guardians of the just Rights of the Crown, and of their Fellow Subjects, can you suggest any other Way of terminating these Disputes, consistent with the Ideas of Justice and propriety conceived by the Kings Subjects on both Sides the Atlantick?  
A. I do not see how that Method can be deemed repugnant to the Rights of the Crown. If the Americans are put into their former Situation, it must be by an Act of Parliament, in the Passing of which by the King the Rights of the Crown are exercised not infringed. It is indifferent to the Crown whether the Aids received from America are Granted by Parliament here, or by the Assemblies there, provided the Quantum be the same; and it is my Opinion more will generally be Granted there Voluntarily than can ever be exacted and collected from thence by Authority of parliament. As to the rights of Fellow Subjects (I suppose you mean the People of Britain) I cannot conceive how they will be infringed by that method. They will still enjoy the Right of Granting their own money; and may still, if it pleases them, keep up their Claim to the Right of granting ours; a Right they can never exercise properly, for want of a sufficient Knowledge of us, our Circumstances and Abilities (to say nothing of the little likelihood there is that we should ever submit to it) therefore a Right that can be of no good use to them. And we shall continue to enjoy, in fact, the Right of granting our own Money; with the Opinion now universally prevailing among us that we are free Subjects of the King, and that Fellow Subjects of one Part of his Dominions are not Sovereign over Fellow Subjects in any other Part. If the Subjects on the different Sides of the Atlantic, have different and opposite Ideas of Justice or Propriety, no one Method can possibly be consistent with both. The best will be to let each enjoy their own Opinions, without disturbing them when they do not interfere with the common Good.  
“6. And if this Method were actually followed do you not think it would encourage the Violent and Factious Part of the Colonists to aim at still farther Concessions from the Mother Country?”  
A. I do not think it would. There may be a few among them that deserve the Name of factious and Violent, as there are in all Countries, but these would have little influence if the great Majority of Sober reasonable People were satisfy’d. If any Colony should happen to think that some of your regulations of Trade are inconvenient to the general Interest of the Empire, or prejudicial to them without being beneficial to you, they will state these Matters to the Parliament in Petitions as heretofore, but will, I believe, take no violent steps to obtain, what they may hope for in time from the Wisdom of Government here. I know of nothing else they can have in View. The Notion that prevails here of their being desirous of setting up a Kingdom or Common Wealth of their own, is to my certain Knowledge entirely groundless. I therefore think that on a total Repeal of all Duties laid expressly for the purpose of raising a Revenue on the People of America, without their Consent, the present Uneasiness would subside; the Agreements not to import would be dissolved, and the Commerce flourish as heretofore. And I am confirm’d in this Sentiment by all the Letters I have received from America, and by the Opinion of all the Sensible People who have lately come from thence, Crown Officers excepted. I know indeed that the people of Boston are grievously offended by the Quartering of Troops among them, as they think, contrary to Law; and are very angry with the Board of Commissioners to have calumniated them to Government; but as I suppose withdrawing of those Troops may be a Consequence of Reconciliating Measures taking Place; and that the Commission also will either be dissolv’d if found useless, or fill’d with more temporate and prudent Men if still deemed useful and necessary, I do not imagine these Particulars will prevent a return of the Harmony so much to be wished.  
“7. If they are relieved in Part only, what [do] you, as a reasonable and dispassionate Man, and an equal Friend to both sides, imagine will be the probable Consequence?”  
A. I imagine that repealing the offensive Duties in part will answer no End to this Country; the Commerce will remain obstructed, and the Americans go on with their Schemes of Frugality, Industry and Manufactures, to their own great Advantage. How much that may tend to the prejudice of Britain I cannot say; perhaps not so much as some apprehend, since she may in time find New Markets. But I think (if the Union of the two Countries continues to subsist) it will not hurt the general interest; for whatever Wealth Britain loses by the Failure of its Trade with the Colonies, America will gain; and the Crown will receive equal Aids from its Subjects upon the whole, if not greater.  
And now I have answered your Questions as to what may be in my Opinion the Consequences of this or that supposed Measure, I will go a little farther, and tell you what I fear is more likely to come to pass in Reality.  
I apprehend, that the Ministry, at least the American part of it, being fully persuaded of the Right of Parliament, think it ought to be enforc’d whatever may be the Consequences; and at the same time do not believe there is even now any Abatement of the Trade between the two Countries on account of these Disputes; or that if there is, it is small and cannot long Continue; they are assured by the Crown officers in America that Manufactures are impossible there; that the Discontented are few, and Persons of little Consequence; that almost all the People of Property and Importance are satisfyd, and disposed to submit quietly to the Taxing-Power of Parliament; and that if the Revenue Acts are continued, those Duties only that are called anti-commercial being repealed, and others perhaps laid in their stead, that Power will ere long be patiently submitted to, and the Agreements not to import be broken when they are found to produce no Change of Measures here. From these and similar Misinformations, which seem to be credited, I think it likely that no thorough redress of Grievances will be afforded to America this Session. This may inflame Matters still more in that Country; farther rash Measures there may create more Resentment here, that may Produce not merely ill-advis’d and useless Dissolutions of their Assemblies, as last Year; but Attempts to Dissolve their Constitutions; more Troops may be sent over, which will create more Uneasiness; to justify the Measures of Government your Ministerial Writers will revile the Americans in your Newspapers, as they have already began to do, treating them as Miscreants, Rogues, Dastards, Rebels, &amp;c. which will tend farther to alienate the Minds of the People here from them, and diminish their Affections to this Country. Possibly too, some of their warm patriots may be distracted enough to expose themselves by some mad Action, to [be] sent for Hither, and Government here be indiscreet enough to Hang them on the Act of H. 8. Mutual Provocations will thus go on to complete the Separation; and instead of that cordial Affection that once and so long existed, and that Harmony so suitable to the Circumstances, and so Necessary to the Happiness, Strength Safety and Welfare of both Countries; an implacable Malice and Mutual Hatred, (such as we now see subsisting between the Spaniards and Portuguese, the Genoese and Corsicans, from the same Original Misconduct in the Superior Government) will take place; the Sameness of Nation, the Similarity of Religion, Manners and Language not in the least Preventing in our Case, more than it did in theirs. I hope however that this may all prove false Prophecy: And that you and I may live to see as sincere and Perfect a friendship establish’d between our respective Countries as has so many years Subsisted between Mr. Strahan and his truly affectionate Friend  
B. Franklin

liritiih icfiftaturo o-cr uZf Lis Mujefiy s domimtns.&quot; I bipt  
j cur information is good; ar.d that what you fuppsft tj be tn  
.n.templatior., will be carried into execution, by repealing all  
the hw* tbit have been made for raffing a revenue in Ame­  
rica by authority of parliament without the confont cf the  
people there. Tic nu.wur and dignity of the Britijb legijla­  
tute will rot be hurt by jueb an ahi if juftite and Wijuom.  
TLewiftft councils are liable to be mijud, ejpe.iahy in matters  
remote from tbeir in/pefiicn. It it tbe ptriirting in an er­  
ror, tut tl e correfting it, that lessons thi bomasr of any man  
or body of men. The lupremacy of that legijlaturc, 1 believe  
■Mill be left preformed by making a very /paring uft of it;  
never but for the ezident good of the Colonia tbanftiva, or  
cf the wiole Briti/h empire ; never for the partial advantage  
of Britain to their prejudice. By fueb prudent conduO, I  
imagine that Jupremacy may be gradually jlrengtbtned,  
and in time fully ejiabiijhed ; but otberwift, I apprehend  
it will be disputed, and loft in the dispute. At pre­  
sent the colonies corjent and submit to it, Jortbt regulations  
of general commerce ; but a fubmijfion to afts of parlia­  
ment was no part of their original ccnftituticn. Our f ormer  
Kings governed their colon ns at they bad governed  
, tbeir dominion, in France, without the participation of Bri­  
tfr parliament,. The parliament of England never pre­  
sumed to interfere in tbatperogatrue till the time of the great  
rebellton, when they usurped the government of all the King&#x27;s  
other demtnions, Ireland, Scotland, &amp;c. the colonies that held  
for the King, they conquer ed by force of arms, and governed  
afterwards as conquered countries : But New-England  
Laving not eppofed the parliament, was confidcred and treat­  
ed at a fjicr kingdom in amity with England, as appears by  
the J cur nah, March 10, 1642. Your fir ft qucftun is,  
ift. not a repeal of Al tbe duties, that on tea tx­  
.epttd, which was before paid here on exportation, and of  
courft no ntw oppefitien fully fatify the ccioniftt P&quot;  
Answer. I think not.  
td. “ Tour reasons fir that opinion P&quot;  
A. Becauft it is not the fam paid in that duty on tea that  
&gt;1 complained of as a burthen, but the principle of the all  
exprejjed tn the preamble, vix. that those duties were laid  
for the better fuppurt of government, and the adminiArati*  
on of juHice in the colonics. This the colcnfts think un­  
ntccffiiy, ur-juft and dangerous to their meji important rights.  
Unnecelfary, because in all the colonies, two or three new  
ones ex. opted, gcvernmcnt and the administration of justice  
were, and always bad been, well supported without any  
charge to Britain t Unjust, as it made fueb colonies liable to  
pay such charge for others in tbhich they bad no concern or  
inter est : Dangerous, as such mode of raffing nony for those  
turpofes tended to render tbeir assemblies useless ; for if a  
•evenuc couid bP rai/ed in the colonies fir all tbe purposes of  
government by aft of parliament, without grants from tbe  
people there, Gove nors, who do not generally len t assemblies,  
would never call them ; they would be laid aside ; and  
then nothing f could depend on the people&#x27;s good-will to go-  
I&#x27; vermnent, their rights would he trampled on ; they would  
oe treated with contempt. A-o&#x27;tier reason why I think  
they would not he fathficd with such a partial repeal, it,  
that tLeir agreements not tu import till tbe repeal take, place,  
include the wbcle, whirb shews that they object to tbe while ;  
and tboft agreement, will continue binding on them, if tbe  
whole is not repealed.  
&#x27;pl. “ Du you think the only effiHuul way of comgofing  
tie prefer.: differences, is to put .be Americans precisely in the  
situation they were in before the pajftng of the lute jiamp  
alt P&quot;  
A&#x27; I think ft.  
Calins fir that opinion P&quot;  
A. Other tr.nl.ids have been tried. They have been re­  
buked-n angry letters. Their petitions have lecn rfuftd or  
r fitted ly parliament. Theo have been threatened with tbe  
punifrmn:; of treaftn by refdves of both boufes. Tbeir as-  
Ji-mblies have been a ffclved,ar.d troops have been sent among  
them : But ail theft way, have only cxajptrated tbeir minds  
and wAintd the breach. Tbeir agreement, to use no mere  
Britifb mamfaSure, have hrtn ftrergther.ed; and theft mea­  
sures infsrad vj difrerencet, and promoting a good  
lorrcfpondence, have ainufi unn.hilatedyour commerce with  
tboft countries, and greatly endangered tbe national peace and  
gyncrj wclfycs. , . . -  
yh. “ If this last method is deemed by tbe iegiflature and  
bit Majcfj s minified to be repugnant to their duty as guar­  
dians of the sut right, of tbe crown and cf their fillow fub­  
jeSs, canyou fuggft awe über way of terminating theft dis­  
putes, conjiftent with the idea, of justice and pr.pricty con­  
ceivedby tbe King’s fubjeSs on both Jides tbe Atlantic ?&quot;  
A. Ido not Jee how that method can be deemed repugnant  
to the light: or the crown. If the Americans are put into  
tbeir firmci fituatior., it must be by an all of parliament, in  
tbe sassing cf which by the King, the rights cf tbe crown  
are exerciftd, not infringed. It is indifferent to the crown,  
whether tbe aid, rec n-ed from America are granted by par­  
liament here, or’by tbe afjemllics there, pronnded the quantum  
er tbe fame j ar.d it i, my opinion that more will be general­  
ly granted there vtluntanly, there can ever be cxacled or col­  
cefied from thence by authority of parliament. As to tbe  
right, of teilow fubjdU, I fuppoft you mean the pt-ple of  
Britain, cannot conceive bow theft will be infringed by that  
metbed. Tl cy willftillenjoy the right cf gra- ting their own  
money, and may still, fit pleaft, them, keep up tbeir claim to  
tbe right of granting ours ; m right they can never exercise  
properly, hr want cf a efficient knowledge of us, our cir­  
camftances and abilities, to fay nctbing of tbe little likelihood  
there it that we ‘hould ever Ju limit to it, therefore a right  
that can he of no getd uft to them ; and we frail continue to  
enjoy in faft tie right of granting cur money, with tbe opinion  
new univerfijity prevailing among us, that we are free fub­  
yeflt of the King, end that fellow fuhjefls of one part of hie  
dominmas, are net fovercign* over fellow fubje6&gt;s in any  
ether part. If the fubiefis on the different fide, of the At­  
lantic have different and cppqfite ideas cf &quot;justice and pro­  
priety,&quot; no me M method&quot; canpoffibly be ccnjiftent with both.  
The heft will be to let each enjoy their own opinions, without  
dr Curbing th m whtn th y do r.ct interfere with the ccmmc rgood.  
6th. “ And if this method were allually followed, do  
c -jou not think if would encourage the violent andfafii&#x27;v,  
part of the eotonfl, to aim at still farther cc.i.cfficns from the  
mothsr country  
A. Ido not think it would. There may be a few amtng  
them teat defcrve the name of faflious and violent, as there  
arc in all countries j but theft would have little influence, if  
the great usajority of fobcr reaftnable people were fatifed.  
If any colony should happen to think that fame of your regula­  
lationt cf trade are InccnvenieM to the generalinter est of the  
Empire, or prejudicial to them without being beneficial to you,  
they will fiat e theft matsas to parliament in petition, at here­  
tofore j but will, I bclimc, take no violent fttpt to obtain  
what they may hopefor in time from the wifden of govern­  
ment here. I knovi of nothing rift thy can have in view j  
tbe r.ction that prevail, here of their being defiraut to ftt up a  
kingdom or coueftcn-wraltb of their awn, i, to my certain  
knowledge entirely grcundlefs. I therefore think, teat cn a  
total repeal of all duties, laid exprelly for the purpnie of  
railing a revenue on the people of America, without their  
consent, tbepreftnt uneaftmft would fubfidc, tbe agreements  
net to import would be dissolved, and tbe commerce flourifr  
a, heretofore : And lam confirmed in this jentiment by all  
tbe letter, I Lave received from America, and by tie eptnior.s  
of all the fcnjlble people-who have lately come from thence,  
rrawn ffeer. excepted. I know indeed that tbe people of  
Befton are grievously offended by tbe quartering of troeps  
among them, as they think contrary to law ; and very cxgry  
with tbe board of commifficnert who have calumniated them  
togca ernmcnt : But as I fopfofe the withdrawing cf thoje  
troops may be a confequer.ce of recoucMating mcafure, taking  
place ; and that tbe commifiitn also will be either dtffdved if  
found useless, m- filled with more temperate andpr-.dent men,  
if still deemed ufeieft and necessary, I do not imagine theft  
particulars would prevent a return of tbe barmory ft much  
to be wifbed.  
•7th. “ If they are rAieved in part only, what do you, as  
a reaftnahie and ilifpaffor.ete max, ar.d an tqujfrier.d to  
ba if.des. ima ine will be t&#x27;e probable confejucace ?

And now I have anfweredyour questions as toi hat may  
be, in my cpinion, the cenftqueacts of this or that fttftfoftd  
nuafure, I will go a little farther, and tell you wbat I fear is  
more likely to come to pajs in reality. I ajpisbend that the  
Minifhy, at least the American part of it, beingfully per­  
fuadtd of the right of Parliament, think it ought to be m­  
forccd, whatever may be the confequenets, and at the fame  
time do not believe, there is ever, new an abatement of tbe  
trad: between the two countries on account of tbeft disputes j  
or that if there is, it is small, and cannot long continue.  
They are assured by the crvwn-cfficcn in America, that ma­  
nufatiurcs are impojfible there, that the dis contented are few,  
and persons of little confequcnce j that almost all tbe people  
es property and importance arefatisfied, ar.d disposed to fub­  
mtt quietly to the taxing power of paillament ; and that if  
tbe revenue alls are continued, andtboft duties only that are  
called anti-, ommercia! being repealed, and others perhaps laid  
in tbeir stead ; that power ere long will be patiently fubmited  
to, and tbe agreenunts not to imptci be broken, when they  
are found to product no change of mcafures here. From  
theft and fimuiar mifinformatioM which fecm to be credited,  
I think it likely tbat no thorough redress cf grievances will be  
afforded to America this ftfriu. This may irfiams matters  
still more in that country ; jartber rafr mrafures there may  
create more resentment here, tbat may produce not merely Hl­  
adviftd diffolutisns of tbeir effembhes as lift! year, but at­  
tempts to diffolvt their constitutions ; more troops may be ftnt  
over, which will create more uneafineft ; to juftify tbe mea­  
fores of government, your writers will revile the Americans  
in your news-papers, as they Lave already begun to do ; treat­  
ing them as miftreants, rogues, dastards, r eel;, to alie­  
nate the minds of tbe people here from than, and which will  
find farther to diminijh their affcchtns to this count-y. PiJ­  
fibly too, feme of tbeir warm patriots may be diftratied enough  
to .xpoft them fives by fame mad a flion to be font for hither  
and government here be indiftreat enough to bang them, on

The Answer.  
  
Qravfn-JireeU Nov* 29.1769.  
  
Sin  
  
EING juft returned to town from a  
little excurfion, I find yours of the  
21ft, containing a number of queries that  
would require a pamphlet to anfwer them  
fully. You, however, defire only brief  
anfwers, which I fhali endeavour to give.  
Previous to your queries, you tell me,  
yiat “ you apprehend his Majelty’s fer-  
vants have now in contempinion, ift, to  
relieve the colonifts from tli^axes com¬  
plained of; ad, to preferve the honour,  
the dignity, and the fupremacy of the  
Britifh legiftature over all&quot; his Majefty’s  
dominions.” I hope your ioformatiou is  
  
good, and that what you fuppofe to be &gt;a  
contemplation will be earned into exe¬  
cution, by repealing a/i the lawj that have  
been made for raifing a revenue in Ame-  
lica by authority of parliament without  
the confent of the people there. The ho^  
nour and dignity of the Britilh legiflaturc  
will not be hurt by fuch an adt of juftict  
and wifdom. The w’ifcft councils are lia¬  
ble to be milled, efpecialiy in matters re¬  
mote from their infpedlion. It is the  
per filling in an error, not the correcting it,  
that lelfens the honour of any man or bo¬  
dy of men. The fupremacy of that legif-  
lature, I believe, will be beft preferved by  
making a very fparing ufe of it; never but  
for the evident good of the colonies them-  
felves, or of the whole Britilh empire;  
never for the partial advantage of Britain  
to their prejudice. By fuch prudent con-  
dud I imagine that fupremacy may be  
gradually ftrengthened, and in time fully  
eftabliftied ; but otherwife, I apprehend  
it will be difputed, and loft in thedifpute.  
At prefent the colonies confent and fub-  
mit to it, for the regulations of general  
commerce; but a fubmiflion to ads of  
parliament was no part of their original  
confiitution. Our former kings govern¬  
ed their colonies as they had governed  
their dominions in France, without the  
participation of Britilh parliaments. The  
parliament of England never prefumed to  
interfere in that prerogative till the time  
of the great rebellion, when they ufurped  
the government of all the king’s other  
dominions, Ireland, Scotland, &amp;c. The  
colonies that held for the king they con¬  
quered by force of arms, and governed  
afterwards as conquered countries: But  
New-England having not oppofed the  
parliament, was confidered and treated  
as a filler kingdom, in amity with Eng¬  
land, as appears by the Journals, March  
10.1642.  
  
“ ift. Will not a repeal of all the du¬  
ties, (that on tea excepted, which was be¬  
fore paid here on exportation, aod of  
courfeno new impofition) fully fatisfy the  
^colonifts?”  
  
Anfwer* I think not.  
  
2d. “ Yonr reafons for that opinion  
  
A* Becaufe it is not the Sum paid in  
that duty on tea that is complained of as  
a burden, but the principle of the aCt ex-  
preffed in the preamble, viz. That thofe  
duties were laid/or the hd^er fupport of  
governmenty and the admin^ration of jvf*  
tice in the colonies. This the colonifts  
tlijhk uiineceftary, unjuft, and dangerous  
  
I

(0 their mpft important right. Vnnecejfary^  
bccaufc in all the colonies (two or three  
new ones excepted) government and the  
^adminiftration of juftice were, and always  
had been, well lupported without any  
charge to Britain: XJnjuft&lt;t ai it has  
made fuch colonies liable to pay fuch  
charge for others in which they had no  
concern or intereft: Dangerous^ as fuch  
mode of raifing money tor thofe purpofes  
tended to render the affcmblies utelefs;  
for if a revenue could be railed in the co¬  
lonies for all the purpofcs of government  
by ad of parliament, without grants from  
the people there* governors, who do not  
generally love affcmblies, would never call  
them ; they would be laid afide; and  
when nothing (hould depend on the peo¬  
ple’s good-will to government, their rights  
would be trampled on ; they would be  
treated with contempt. Another leafon  
why I think they would not be faiistied  
with fuch a partial repeal, is, that their  
agreements not to import till the repeal  
takes place, include the whole, which  
fliews that they objed to the whole; and  
thofe agreements will continue binding  
on them, if the whole is not repealed.  
  
3d. Do you think the only effedual  
way of compofing the prefent differences,  
is to put the Americans precifely in the  
lituation they were in before the paffing  
of the late ftamp-ad  
  
A. I think fo,  
  
4th. “ Your rcafons for that opinion?”  
  
A, Other methods have been tried.  
They have been rebuked in angry letters.  
Their petitions have been retufed or re-  
jeded by parliament. They have been  
threatened with the piinilliments of trea-  
fon by rcfolves of both houfes. Their  
affcmblies have been diffolved, and troops  
have been fent among them: But all thefe  
ways have only exafperated their minds  
and widened the breach. Their agree¬  
ments to life no more Britilli manufac¬  
tures have been ftrengthened ; and Ihele  
meafures* inftead of compofing differen¬  
ces, and promoting a good correfpon-  
dcnce, have almoft annihilated your com¬  
merce wdth thofe countries, and greatly  
endangc-red the national peace and gene¬  
ral welfare.  
  
5th. “ If this lad method is deemed  
by the legiflature and his Majelly’s mini-  
tters to be repugnant to their duty as  
guardians of the juft rights of the crown,  
and of their fellow-fubjedls, can you fug¬  
ged any other way of terminating thefe  
difpuies, conliftent with the idgas of juf¬  
  
tice and propriety conceived by the king’s  
fubje^ts on both Tides the Atlantic ?”  
  
A. 1 do not fee how that method can  
be deemed repugnant to the rights of the  
Crown. If the Americans are put into  
tncirformrrlituation, it mud be by an ad  
of parliament, in the polling of which by  
the king, the rights of the crown are cx-  
ercifed, not infringed. It is indifferent  
to the crown, whether the aids received  
from America are granted by parliamenc  
here, or by the affemblics there, provided  
the quantum be the fame; and it is my  
opinion, that more will be generally grant¬  
ed there voluntarily, than can be exaded  
or colleded from thence by authority of  
parliament. As to the rights of Fellow  
SubjeSs (1 fuppofe you mean the people of  
Britain), I cannot conceive how thofe will  
be infringed by that method. They will  
dill enjoy the right &lt;»f granting their own  
money, and may dill, if it plcafes them,  
keep up their claim to the right of grant¬  
ing a right they can never exercife  
properly, for want offudicient knowledge  
of us, our circumdances and abilities (to  
fay nothing of the little likelihood there  
is that we ihould ever fubmit to it); there-.  
fore a right that can be of no good ufe to  
them ; and we (hall continue to enjoy in  
fad the right of granting cur money, with  
the opinion now univerlhlly prevailing a-  
mong us, that we are free fubjeds of the  
king, and that Fellow Subjeds of one part  
of his dominions are not Sovereigns over  
FellowSubjeds in any other part. If the  
fubjeds on the different Tides of the At¬  
lantic have different and oppofitc ideas of  
“judiceand propriety,” no one “ me¬  
thod” can poffibly be confident with both •  
The bell will be, to let each enjoy their  
own cpinions, without difturbiiig them  
when they do not interfere with the com¬  
mon good.  
  
6th. ‘‘ And if this method were adual-  
ly followed, do you not think it would  
encourage the violent and factious part of  
the colonids to aim at dill farther concef-  
dons frf &#x27;m the mother country ?”  
  
A. 1 do not think it would. There  
may be a few among them that deferve  
the name of fadious and violent, as there  
are in all countries; but thefe would have  
little influence, if the great majority of  
fober, reafonable people were fatisfied.  
If any colony ihould happen to think that  
fome of your regulations ot trade arc in¬  
convenient to the general intered of the  
empire, or prejudicial to them w’ithout  
being beneficial to you, they will date

ments not 10 import w’ould be didolved,  
and the commerce flourilh as heretofore;  
and I am confirmed in this fentimentby all  
the letters 1 have received from America,  
and by the opinions of all the fenlible peo¬  
ple who have lately come from thence,  
crown officers excepted. I know, indeed,  
that the people of Bofton are grievoufly  
offended by the quartering of troops a-  
mong them, as they think contrary to  
law ; and are very angry with the board  
of commiflioners who have calumniated  
them to government; but as I fuppofe the  
withdrawing of thofe troops may be a  
confequence of reconciliating meafurcs  
taking place, and that the commiffion al-  
fo will be either diffolvcd, if found ufe-  
Icfs, or filled with more temperate and  
prudent men, if ftill deemed ufcful and  
I neceffary, I do not imagine thefe particu¬  
lars w’ould prevent a return of the har¬  
mony fo much to be wdfhed.  
  
7th. “ If they are relieved in part only,  
what do you, as a rcafonable and difpaf-  
fionatc man, and an equal friend to both  
(ides, imagine will be the probable confe-  
qucnce  
  
A. I imagine, that repealing the offen-  
live duties in part will anfwer no end to  
this country ; the commerce will remain  
obflruded, and the Americans go on with  
their fchemes of frugality, induftry, and  
manufactures, to their own great advan¬  
tage How much that may tend to the  
prejudice of Britain, I cannot fay ; per¬  
haps not fo much as fome apprehend,  
fince file may in time find new markets.  
But I think, if the union of the tw’O coun¬  
tries continues to fubfift, it will not hurt  
\\ie general inter eft ; for whatever wealth  
Britain lofes by the failing of its trade  
with the colonies, America will gain; and  
the crown wull receive equal aids from  
its fubjcCls upon the whole, if not greater.  
  
And now 1 have anfwered your quef-  
tions as to what may be, in my opinion,  
the confcquences of this or that fuppofed  
  
meafure. I will go a little farther, and  
tell you what I fear is more likely to come  
to pafs in reality. I apprehend that the  
miniftry, at leaft the American part of it,  
being fully perfuaded of the right of par-,  
liament, think it ought to be inforced,  
w’hatcver may be the confequences ; and  
at the fame time do not believe, there is  
even now any abatement of the trade be¬  
tween the two countries on account of  
thefe difputes; or that if there is, it is  
fmall, and cannot long continue. They  
are aflured by the crown officers in Ame¬  
rica, that manufactures are impoffible&#x27;  
there; that the difeontented are few, and  
perfons of little confequence; that almoft  
all the people of property and importance  
are fatisfied, and difpofed to fubmit quiet¬  
ly to the taxing power of parliament; and  
that if the revenue aCls are continued,  
and thofe duties only that are called anti¬  
commercial being repealed,and others per¬  
haps laid in their (lead, that power ^ere  
long will be patiently fubmitted to, and  
the agreements not to import be broken,  
when they are found to produce no change  
of meafures here. From thefe and fimi-  
Ur mifinformations, which feem to be cre¬  
dited, 1 think it likely that no thorough  
redrefs of grievances will be afforded to  
America this feffion. This may inflame  
matters ftill more in that country ; far¬  
ther rafii meafures there may create more  
refentment that may produce not  
merely ill advifed diffolutions of their af-  
femblies as laft year, but attempts to dif-  
folve theirconftitution; more troops may  
be fent over, which will create more un-  
eafinefb : To juftify the meafures of go¬  
vernment, your writers will revile the  
Americans in your news-papers, as they  
have already begun to do ; treating them  
as mifereants, rogues, daftards, rebels,  
&amp;c. to alienate the minds of the people  
here from them, and which will tend far¬  
ther to diminifii their affeClions to this  
country. Poffibly too fome of their  
w^arm patriots may be diftraCled enough  
to expofe themfelves by fome mad aCtion  
to be fent for hither; and government  
here be i ndi fcrcet enough to hang them, on  
the ACt of Hen. VIII. Mutual provocations  
will thus go on to compleat the repara¬  
tion ; and inftcad of that cordial affection  
that once and fo long exifted, and that  
harmony fo fuitable to the circumftances,  
and fo neceffary to thehappinefs, ftrength,  
fafety, and welfare of both countries; an  
implacable malice, mutual hatred, fucli  
as we Tiovt fee fubfifting bctw’een the Spa¬  
niards and Portuguere, the Genoefe and

(imilarity of religion, manners, and lan¬  
guage, not in the lead preventing in our  
cafe, more flian it did in theirs^—I hope,  
however, that this may all prove falfe  
prophecy, and that you and I may live  
to fee as Hncere and peife^t a friendlhip  
edabliihed between our refpqdivc coiin-
