Emily.”—Canada’s bright and sensible * Governor-  
General, Lord Dufferin, has given to the Dominion  
people a new by-word, which has spread with elec­  
tric rapidity from one end of Canada to the other.  
On his voyage out, being called upon by the emi­  
grants to address them, he alluded to this pfirase,  
which had grated harshly on his ear:  
“ He had the misfortune of having too many chil­  
dren.”  
Lord Dufferin said?  
“I remarked that perhaps no better idea could be  
given of the difference between the old country and  
their new home than by the fact that whereas in  
England a struggling man might be overweighted in  
the battle of life by a too numerous family, in the  
land to which they were going a man could scarcely  
have too many children. Here I was applauded  
lustily, with a cheerful accompaniment of laughter,  
wnen I was further greeted by an approving thump  
on the back by a stalwart young emigrant, who cried  
out:  
“ ‘ Right you-are, sir I That’s what I’ve been tell­  
ing Emily.’ ”  
The Canadians have got up the slUng phrase:  
“ That’s what I’ve been telling Emily,” having had  
the anecdote made familiar by going the rounds of  
the newspapers, and now one hears everywhere:  
“ That’s what I’ve been telling Emily.

EtItY.&quot;The above sentence has  
become a by-word in Canada, having  
spread with almost electric rapidity  
from one end of the Dominion to the  
other. It had its origin as follows:  
When Lord Dufferin, the new, and  
withal bright and sensible Governor  
General of Canada, was on his way to  
America the last time, he was called  
upon to make a speech to the emi-­  
grants on board. He did so; and in  
the course of his practical talk refer-­  
red to a phrase which he had heard  
on board ship since he started--a  
certain man saying that he &quot;had the  
misfortune to have too many chil-­  
dren.&quot; Lord D. combatted this idea  
saying in conclusion that whereas in  
England a struggling man might  
overweighed in the battle of life by  
numerous family, in the land to which  
they were going a man could scarcely  
have too many children. Here h  
was applauded lustily, while one stal­  
wart young emigrant was so delight  
ed at the sentence that he greeted  
the speaker with an approving thump  
on the back, exclaiming in triumphant  
tones, &quot;That&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve been  
telling Emily!&quot;  
  
Lord Dufferin on reaching home  
repeated the anecdote, and the quaint  
phrase &quot;took,&quot; until now one hears  
everywhere throughout Canada the  
oftentimes irrelevant exclamation:  
&quot;That&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve been telling

EMIlY.--Canada&#x27;s bright and sensible  
Governor-General, Lord Dufferin, has  
given to the Dominion people a new by  
word, which has spread with electric  
rapidity from one end of Canada to the  
other. On his voyage out, being called

grated harshly on his ear, &quot;He had the  
misfortune of having too many chil

Lord Dufferin said: &quot;I remarked that  
perhaps no better idea could be given  
of difference between the old country  
and their new home than by the fact  
that whereas in England a struggling  
man might be overweighed in the battle  
of life by a too numerous family, in the  
land to which they were going a man  
could scarcely have too many children.  
Here I was applauded lustily with a  
cheerful accompaniment of laughter al­

improving thump on the back by a stal­  
wart young emigrant, who cried out,  
&quot;Right, you are sir; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve  
been telling Emily.&quot;
