When Mr. Bradford publishes after us, and has Occasion to take an Article or two out of the Gazette, which he is always welcome to do, he is desired not to date his Paper a Day before ours, (as last Week in the Case of the Letter containing Kelsey’s Speech, &amp;c.) lest distant Readers should imagine we take from him, which we always carefully avoid.

, a Fire broke out in a Store near Mr. Fishbourn’s Wharff, and before it could be master’d consumed all the Stores, &amp;c. on the Wharff, damaged several Houses on that Side the Street, and crossing the Way, seized the fine House of Mr. J. Dickinson, with two other Houses adjoining towards Walnut-street, which are all ruined. The Loss in the Whole is supposed to be four or five Thousand Pounds. It is thought that if the People had been provided with good Engines and other suitable Instruments, the Fire might easily have been prevented spreading, as there was but little Wind. There is now a Subscription on Foot for supplying the Town with every Thing necessary of that Nature, which meets with great Encouragement. There was much Thieving at the Fire, and

In ITiO a fire broke out In a store near what  
was known as Mr. Fishbourne&#x27;s wharf. This  
consumed all the stores there, damaged several  
houses on that side of the street, then crossed  
over and destroyed the fine house of Jonathan  
Dickinson and two others toward Walnut street.  
Tbe total loss was abont 5000. The locality of  
the fire was for twenty years afterwards called  
Dickinson&#x27;s burnt buildings. The site was  
afterwards that of the Ross buildings in Front  
street, east side, south of Walnut. This fire  
proved that the Fire Department was not in a  
very effective condition, and a subscription was  
immediately started to supply the town with  
everything necessary for the extinguishing o!  
fires. In the language of the subscription paper  
relating to the Dickinson fire, &quot;it was then
