f Margaret Aftercast,  
SHEWETH,  
“1. That your Petitioner being puff’d up in her younger Years with a numerous Train of Humble Servants, had the Vanity to think, that her extraordinary Wit and Beauty would continually recommend her to the Esteem of the Gallants; and therefore as soon as it came to be publickly known that any Gentleman address’d her, he was immediately discarded.  
“2. That several of your Petitioners Humble Servants, who upon their being rejected by her, were, to all Apperance in a dying Condition, have since recover’d their Health, and been several Years married, to the great Surprize and Grief of your Petitioner, who parted with them upon no other Conditions, but that they should die or run distracted for her, as several of them faithfully promis’d to do.  
“3. That your Petitioner finding her self disappointed in and neglected by her former Adorers, and no new Offers appearing for some Years past, she has been industriously contracting Acquaintance with several Families in Town and Country, where any young Gentlemen or Widowers have resided, and endeavour’d to appear as conversable as possible before them: She has likewise been a strict Observer of the Fashion, and always appear’d well dress’d. And the better to restore her decay’d Beauty, she has consum’d above Fifty Pound’s Worth of the most approved Cosmeticks. But all won’t do.  
“Your Petitioner therefore most humbly prays, That you would be pleased to form a Project for the Relief of all those penitent Mortals of the fair Sex, that are like to be punish’d with their Virginity until old Age, for the Pride and Insolence of their Youth.  
“And your Petition

her husband. Another discusses the sad lot  
of the maid who, “being puffed up in her  
younger Years with a numerous Train of  
Humble Servants, had the Vanity to think,  
that her extraordinary Wit and Beauty could  
continually recommend her to the Esteem  
of the Gallants,” but has seen her rejected  
swains, to “all Appearance in a dying Condi- ,  
tion,” recover their health and marry, and  
who, “disappointed in and neglected by her  
former Adorers,” and with “no new Offers  
appearing,” begs the writer “to form a Proj-  
ect for the Relief of all those penitent Mor-  
tals of the Fair Sex, that are like to be  
punished with their Virginity, until old Age,  
for the Pride and Insolence of their Youth.”
