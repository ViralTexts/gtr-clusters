with the Spaniards was for Cattle between them and the French at St. Domingo. I had been told the Spaniards brought Flour to the French Islands from the Continent. He had not heard of it. If we can find that such a Trade is allow’d (perhaps from the Missisipi) have we not a Claim by Treaty to the same Privilege?  
  
July 1st. The Nuncio called and acquainted me that the Pope had, on my Recommendation, appointed Mr. John Carrol, Superior of the Catholic Clergy in America, with many of the Powers of a Bishop; and that probably he would be made a Bishop in partibus before the End of the Year. He asked me which would be most convenient for him to come to France, or go to St. Domingo for Ordination by another Bishop, which was necessary.— I mentioned Quebec as more convenient than either. He asked whether, as that was an English Province, our Government might not take Offence at his going there? I thought not unless the Ordination by that Bishop, should give him some Authority over our Bishop: He said not in the least: that when a Bishop was once ordained, he would be independent of the others, and even of the Pope, which I did not clearly  
  
understand. He said the Congregation de Propaganda Fidei had agreed to receive &amp; maintain and instruct two young Americans in the Languages and Sciences at Rome: He had formerly told me that more would be educated gratis in France. He tells me they write from America that there are 20 Priests, but they are not sufficient; some new Settlements going on near the Missisipi having need of some.  
The Nuncio said we should find that the Catholics were not so intollerant, as they had been represented; that the Inquisition in Rome had not now so much Power as that in Spain; and that in Spain it was used chiefly as a Prison of State for the Use of Government. That the Congregation would have undertaken the Education of more American Youths, and may hereafter, but that at present they are overburthen’d, having some from all Parts of the World: Spoke lightly of their new Convert, Thayers (of Boston) Conversion: That he had advised him not to go to America, but settle in France. That he wanted to go to convert his Countrymen; but he knew nothing yet of his new Religion himself. &amp;ca.

I acquain[ted] him with the Advice I had receiv’d that Mr Jefferson was on his way hither to join Mr Adams and me, and that by him I expected to have our Instructions respecting the Treaty. Wrote a Letter to Count Mercy the Emperor’s Ambassador communicating a former Instruction of Congress, respecting a Treaty with his Impl Majesty, which ha[d] for various Reasons been delay’d, one the not receiving the C[ongress?] [one line missing].  
Tuesday, 27. Lord Fitzmaurice call’d to see me. His Father having requested that I would give him such instructive Hints as might be useful to him, I occasionally mention’d the old Story of Demosthenes’ Answer to one who demanded what was the first Point of Oratory?— Action. The second? Action. The third? Action. which I said had been generally understood to mean the Action of an Orator with his Hands &amp;c. in Speaking: But that I thought another kind of Action of more Importance to an Orator, who would persuade People to follow his Advice, viz. such a Course of Action in the Conduct of Life as would impress them with an Opinion of his Integrity as well as of his Understanding. That this Opinion once establish’d, all the Difficulties, Delays &amp; Oppositions, usually occasion’d by Doubts and Suspicions, were prevented; and such a Man tho’ a very imperfect Speaker, would almost always carry his Points against the most flourishing Orator, who had not the Character of Sincerity. To express my Sense of the Importance of a good private Character in public Affairs more strongly, I said the Advantage of having it, &amp; the disadvantage of not having it were so great,  
  
that I even believ’d if George III had had a bad private Character, and John Wilkes a good one, the latter might have turn’d the former out of his Kingdom.— Lord S. the Father of Lord Fitzmaurice has unfortunately the Character of being insincere, and it has hurt much his Usefulness, tho’ in all my Concerns with him I never saw any Instance of that kind.—

It has been seen that our minister at the  
court of France had been consulted by the  
pope’s nuncio about the appointment of a  
chief pastor for the Catholic church in the  
United States, and it will also appear that  
great deference was paid to his designation of  
the individual whom he thought most eligible  
for that important station.  
  
The following extract from the private jour-  
nal kept by Dr. Franklin, while in France,  
belongs to the history of this transaction.  
  
1784. July 1st.—The pope’s nuncio called  
and acquainted me that the pope had, on my  
recommendation, appointed Mr. John Carroll  
superior of the Catholic clergy in Amcrica,  
with many of the powers of a bishop, and that  
probably he would be made a bishop tn parti-  
bus before the end of the year. He asked  
which would be most convenient for him, to  
come to France, or go to St. Domingo, for  
ordination by another bishop, which was  
necessary. I mentioned Quebec as more  
convenient than either. He asked whether,  
as that was an English province, our govern-  
ment might not take offence at his going  
thither? I thought not, unless the ordination  
by that bishop should give him some authority  
over our bishop. He said, not in the least;  
that when our bishop was once ordained, he  
would be independent of the others, and even  
of the pope—which I did not clearly under-  
stand. He said the Congregation de Propa-  
gandé Fide had agreed to receive and maintain  
and instruct two young Americans in the  
languages and sciences at Rome; (he had  
formerly told me that more would be educated  
gratis in France.) He added, they had written  
from America that there are twenty priests,  
but that they are not sufficient, as the new  
settlements near the Mississippi have need of  
some.  
  
** The nuncio said we should find that the  
Catholics were not so intolerant as they had  
been represented ; that the inquisition in Rome  
had not now so much power as that in Spain,  
and that in Spain it was used chiefly as a

prison of state. That the congregation would  
have undertaken the education of more Amer.  
ican youths, and may hereafter, but that at  
present they are overburdened, having some  
from all parts of the world. He spoke lightly  
of their new Bostonian convert ( Thayer&#x27;s  
conversion); that he had advised him not to  
go to America, but to settle in France. That  
he wanted to go to convert his countrymen,  
but he knew nothing yet of his new religion  
himself,”’? &amp;c.*

Friday, July 16, 1784.—Received a letter from two  
young gentlemen in London, who are come from Amer-  
ica for ecclesiastical orders, and complain they have  
been delayed there a vear, and that the archbishop  
will not permit them to be ordained, unless they will  
take the oath of allegiance, and desiring to know if  
they may be ordained here. Inquired, and learned  
that, if ordained here, they must vow obedience to the  
archbishop of Paris. Directed my grand-son to ask  
the nuncio if their bishop in America might not be  
instructed to do it literally ?  
  
Saturday, 17th.—The nuncio says the thing is im-  
Renee unless the gentlemen become Roman Catholics.  
  
yrote them an answer.  
  
Sunday, 18th.—A good abbe brings me a large man-  
uscript containing a scheme of reformation of all  
churches and states, religion, commerce, laws, &amp;c.  
which he has planned in his closet, without much  
knowledge of the world. I have promised to look it

The subjoined extract from Dr. Franklin’s memoirs throws addi-  
tional light on this important subject, and shows the view that phil-  
osopher took of a matter so deeply concerning the Church in this  
country: “ 1784, July 1st,” he writes, “The Pope’s Nuncio called,  
and acquainted me that he had, on my recommendation, appointed  
Mr. John Carroll Superior of the Catholic clergy in America, with  
many of the powers of a Bishop, and that probably he would be  
made a Bishop in partibus before the end of the year. He asked  
which would be most convenient for him, to come to France or to go  
to St. Domingo for ordination by another Bishop, which was necessa-  
ry. I mentioned Quebec as more convenient than either. He asked  
whether, as that was an English province, our government might not  
take offence at his going hither. I thought not, unless the ordination  
by that Bishop should give him some authority over our Bishop. He  
said, not in the least ; that when our Bishop ‘was once ordained, he  
would be independent of the other.” Dr. Franklin also communi-  
cated to Congress the project of the court of Rome,-and received an  
answer to the effect that the Federal government had no opinion to  
express on a question not in. its jurisdiction. Religious affairs were  
under the control of the several States. This was at least showing  
the absence of all opposition to a Catholic hierarchy. While we-can-  
not but admire the extreme delicacy of the Holy See in treating with  
the United States in the matter ; we must also recognize the fact tha
