<br/>
An elderly darkey, with a very philosophical and retrospective cast of countenance, was squatting upon his bundle on the hurricane deck of one of the Western river steamers, toasting his shins against the chimney, and apparently plunged in a state of profound meditation. His dress and appearance indicated familiarity with camp life, and it being soon after the siege and capture of Fort Donelson, I was inclined to disturb his reveries, and on interrogation found that he had been with the Union forces at that place, when I questioned further. His philosophy was so much in the Falstaffian vein that I will give his views in his own words as near as my memory will serve me:<br/>
<br/>
Were you in the fight?<br/>
<br/>
I had a little taste of it, sa.<br/>
<br/>
Stood your ground, did you?  <br/>
<br/>
No, sa, I runs.<br/>
<br/>
Run at the first fire, did you?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sa, an&#x27; would hab run soonar had I know&#x27;d it was comin&#x27;.<br/>
<br/>
Why, that wasn&#x27;t very creditable to your courage.	<br/>
Dat isn&#x27;t in my line, sa—cookin&#x27;s my profession.	<br/>
Well, but have you no regard for your reputation?	<br/>
Reputation! nuffin to me de side ob life.&quot;	<br/>
Do you consider your self worth more than other people&#x27;s?	<br/>
It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa.	<br/>
<br/>
Then you must value it very highly?	<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sa. I does; dan all dis world; more dan a million dollars, sa; for what would dat be wuth to a man wid be bref out of him? Self-preserbashun am de fust law wid me, sa.	<br/>
But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?	<br/>
Cause, sa, different men sets different value on derselves; my life is not in de market.	<br/>
<br/>
But if you lost it, you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you died for your country.	<br/>
<br/>
What satisfaction would dat be to me, when der power of feelin&#x27; was gone?	<br/>
<br/>
Then patriotism and honor are nothing to you?	<br/>
Nuffin,&#x27; whatever, sa—I regard dem as among the varieties.	<br/>
If our soldiers were like you, traitors might have broken up the Government without resistance.&quot;	<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sa; der would hab been no help for it. I wouldn&#x27;t put my life in de scales ginst any guberment dat ever existed, for no guberment could replace de loss to me. Spect, dough dat de guberment&#x27;s safe, if da all like me.	<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that any of your company would have missed you if you had been killed?	<br/>
<br/>
May be not, sa; a dead white man ain&#x27;t much to dese sogers, let alone a dead nigga; but I&#x27;d a missed myself, and dat was de pint wid me.	<br/>
<br/>
It is safe to say that the darkey corpse of that African will never darken the field of carnage.<br/>

philosophical and retrospective cast<br/>
of countenance, was squatting upon<br/>
his bundle on the hurricane deck of<br/>
one of the western river steamers,<br/>
toasting his shins against the chim­<br/>

state of profound meditation. His<br/>
appearance and dress indicated fa­<br/>
miliarit&#x27; with camp life, and it be<br/>
ing soon after the seige and capture<br/>
of Fort Donelson,T was inclined to<br/>
disturb his reveries, and on interro­<br/>
gation, found he had been with the<br/>
Union forces at that place, when -1<br/>
questioned him .further. His phil­<br/>
osophy was so much in the Fal­<br/>

&quot;Yes, sa, I does, more dan all dis world;<br/>
more dan a million ob dollars,sa ; for what<br/>
would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref<br/>
out of him ? Self-preserwashun am de first<br/>
law wid me.&quot; a<br/>
&quot; But why should you gct upon a differ­<br/>
ent rule from other men. ?&quot;<br/>
&quot; Because different men setdifferenl wal­<br/>
aes on dar lives-mine is not in de mar­<br/>
ket.&quot;<br/>
&quot;But if you lost it, you would -have the<br/>
satislaction of knowing that you died for<br/>
your country.&quot; -<br/>
&quot; What satisfacahun wad dat be to me<br/>
when de power of feelin&#x27; was gone?&quot;<br/>
&#x27; Then patriotism and honor are nothing<br/>
to you ?&quot; &#x27;<br/>
&quot;&#x27; Nuffn whatever, sa; I regard them as<br/>
amone the wanities.&quot;<br/>
&quot; If our soldiers were like you. traitors<br/>
might have broken up the government<br/>
witholut resistance.&quot;<br/>
&quot; Yes, sa, dar would have been no.belp<br/>
for it. I wouldn&#x27;t put my head in descale,<br/>
ainst no Rubbernment dat ebber existed;<br/>
for no gubbernment could replace the loss<br/>
to me.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do you think any of your company<br/>
would have missed you if you had been<br/>
killed ?&quot;<br/>
S&quot;May be not,sa; a dead white.man<br/>
isn&#x27;t much to dese sojers, let alone a dead<br/>
nigia. But I&#x27;d miss myself, and dat was<br/>

An elderly darkey, with a very philoso­<br/>

ance, was squatting upon his bundle on<br/>
tbe hurricane deck of one of the Western<br/>
river steamers, toasting his shins against<br/>
the chimney, and apparently plunged iu a<br/>
state of profound meditation. His dress<br/>
and appearance indicated familiarity with<br/>
camp life, and it being soon after the siege<br/>
and capture of Fort Donelson, I was in­<br/>
clined to disturb his reveries, and on in­<br/>
terrogation found that he had been with<br/>
the Union forces at that Tlace, when I<br/>
questioned him further. His philosophy<br/>
was so much in the Fal.taflian vein that I<br/>

An elderly darkey, with&#x27;a very philoso<br/>

his reveries, and on interrogation found<br/>
that he&#x27;had been with the Union forces at<br/>
that place, when I&#x27;questioned him further.<br/>
His philosophy was so much in the Falstaf­<br/>
fian vein that I will give his views in his<br/>
own words as near as my memory will serve<br/>
me.<br/>
“Were you in the fight ?”<br/>
“I had a little taste of it, sa.”<br/>
“Stood your ground, did you, my man ?”<br/>
“No, sa, I runs.”<br/>
“Run at first fire, did yon ?”<br/>

&quot;Do you consider your life worth ;<br/>

&quot;It&#x27;s worth more to me, sa ?&quot;<br/>

retrospective cast of countenance, squatted<br/>

A PHILOSOPHICAL DARKEY.<br/>
<br/>
An elderly darkey, with a very philoso­<br/>
phical and retrospective cast of counte­<br/>
nance, was squatting upon hit bundle on<br/>
the hurricane deck of one of the western<br/>
steamers, toasting his shins against the<br/>
chimney and apparently plunged in a state<br/>
of profound meditation. His dresa and<br/>
appearance indicated familiarity with camp<br/>
life ; and it being soon after the siege and<br/>
capture of Fon Donelsorj, I was inclined<br/>
to disturb his reveries. On interrogation<br/>
I found that ha had been with the Union<br/>
forces at that place, when I questioned him<br/>
further. His philosophy was so much in<br/>
the Falstaffian vein that I will give his<br/>
views in his own words, as near as memory<br/>

A correspondent of the Cincinnati Ga­<br/>
zette, writing from the Cumberland river,<br/>
gives the following humorous colloquy<br/>
with a philosophic darkey;<br/>
I noticed upon the hurricane deck to day<br/>
an elderly darkey, with a very philosoph­<br/>
ical and retrospective cast of countenance,<br/>
squatted upon his bundle, toasting bis<br/>
shins against the chimney and apparently<br/>
plunged into a state of profound médita<br/>
tion. Finding upon inquiry, that he be­<br/>
longed to the 9th Illinois, one of the most<br/>
gallantly behaved and heavy-losing regi­<br/>
ments at the Fort Donelson battle and a<br/>
part of which was aboard, I began to in­<br/>
teirogate him upon the subject. His<br/>
philosophy was so much in the Falstaffian<br/>
vein that I will give his views in his own<br/>
words as near as my memory serves me :<br/>
&quot;Were you in the fight?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Had a little taste of it sa.<br/>
&quot;Stood yonr grounds, did you?&quot;<br/>
&quot;No sa, I runs.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Run at the first fire, did yon?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes, and would have run sooner, had<br/>

&quot;Do yon consider yonr life worth more<br/>

&quot;But why should you act upon a dif­<br/>

our gunboats an elderly darkey, with a very philo-<br/>
sophical and retrospective cast of countenance,<br/>
squatted upon his bundle, toasting his shins against<br/>
the chimney, and apparently plunged into a state<br/>
of profound meditation. Finding upon inquiry that<br/>
he belonged to the Ninth Illinois, one of the most<br/>
gallantly behaved and heavy losing regiments at<br/>
the Fort Donelson battle, and part of which was<br/>
aboard, I began to interregate him upon the sub-<br/>
ject: “Were you in the fight?” I asked. ‘Had a<br/>
little taste of it, sah.” “Stood your ground, did<br/>
you?” “No, sah, I runs.” “Run at the first fire,<br/>
did you?” “Yes, sah; and would hab run soonah,<br/>
had I known it war comin’.” ‘Why, that wasn’t<br/>
very creditable to your courage.” “Dat isn’t my<br/>
line, sah—cookin’s my profession.” “Well, but<br/>
have you no regard for your reputation?” ‘‘Repu-<br/>
tation’s nuffin to me by de side ob life.” “Do<br/>
you consider your life worth more than other peo-<br/>

must value it very highly?” “Yes, sah, I does;<br/>
more dan all dis wold, more dan a millicn ob dol-<br/>
lars, sah, for what would dat be wuth to a man wif<br/>
de bref out ob him? Self-preserbation am de fust<br/>
law wid me.” “But why should you act upon a dif-<br/>
ferent rule from other men?” “Because different<br/>
men set different values upon their lives; mine is<br/>
not in de market.” “But if you lost it, you would<br/>
have the satisfaction of knowing that you died for<br/>
your country.” “What satisfaction is dat to me,<br/>
when de power ob feeling is gone?” “Then patriot-<br/>
ism and honor are nothing to you?” “Nuffin, sah<br/>
—I regard them as among the vanities.” “If our<br/>
soldiers were like you traitors might have broken<br/>
up the government without resistance.” ‘Yes,<br/>
sah, dar would hab been no help for it. I wouldn’t<br/>
put my life in the scale ’gainst any gobernment dat<br/>
eber existed, for no gobernment could replace the<br/>
loss to me.” “Do you think any of your company<br/>
would have missed you if you had been killed?”<br/>
‘Mabe not, sah—a dead white man ain’t much to<br/>
dese sogers, let alone a nigga; but I’d a missed<br/>
