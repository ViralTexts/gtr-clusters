Temple has been at home with us during the Christmas Vacation from School. He improves continually, and more and more engages the Regard of all that are acquainted with him, by his pleasing, sensible, manly Behaviour.  
I have of late great Debates with my self whether or not I should continue here any longer. I grow homesick, and being now in my 67th. Year, I begin to apprehend some Infirmity of Age may attack me, and make my Return impracticable. I have also some important Affairs to settle before my Death, a Period I ought now to think cannot be far distant. I see here no Disposition in Parliament to meddle farther in Colony Affairs for the present, either to lay more Duties or to repeal any; and I think, tho’ I were to return again, I may be absent from hence a Year, without any Prejudice to the Business I am engag’d in, tho’ it is not probable that being once at home I should ever again see England. I have indeed so many good kind Friends here, that I could spend the Remainder of my Life among them with great Pleasure, if it were not for my American Connections, and the indelible Affection I retain for that dear Country, from which I have so long been in a State of Exile. My Love to Betsy. I am ever Your affectionate Father

MY DeAr SoN: I had of late great debate  
with myself whether or not I should continue  
here any longer. I grow homesick, and, being  
now in my 67th year, I begin to appre­  
hend some infirmity of age may take me and  
make my return impracticable. I have also  
some important affairs to settle before my  
death, a period I ought now to think cannot be  
far distant. I see here no disposition in Par­  
liament to meddle further in colony affairs for  
the present, either to lay more duties or to re­  
peal any, and I think, though I were to return  
again, I might be absent from here a year  
without any prejudice to the business I am  
engaged in; though it is not probable that,  
eing once at home, I should ever again see  
England. I have indeed so many good, kind  
friends here that I could spend the remainder  
of my life among them, if it were not for my  
American connections and the indellible affec­  
tion I retain for that dear country from which  
I have so long been in a state of exile. My love  
to Betsey. I am ever your affectionate father,  
B. FRANELIN
