THE MECHANIC.—A young man commenced visiting a young woman, and appeared to be well received. One evening he called at the house when it was quite late, which led the girl to inquire where he had been. &quot;I had to work late to-night;&quot; he replied. &quot;Do you work for a living?&quot; inquired the astonished girl. &quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the young man, &quot;I am a mechanic.&quot;—&quot;My brother does&#x27;nt work,&quot; she remarked, &quot;and I dislike the name of mechanic,&quot; and she turned her pretty nose.  
  
That was the last time the mechanic visited the young woman. He is now a wealthy man, and has one of the best women for a wife.—The young woman who disliked the name of a mechanic is now the wife of a miserable tool, a regular vagrant about grog-shops; and she, poor and miserable girl, is obliged to take in washing in order to support herself and children.  
  
Ye who dislike the name of mechanic—whose brothers do nothing but loaf and dress—beware how you treat young men who work for a living. Far better discard the well-fed pauper, with all his rings, jewelry, brazen facedness and pomposity, and take your affections to the callous-handed, intelligent and industrious mechanic. Thousands have bitterly regretted their follow, who have turned their backs on honest industry. A few years of bitter experience taught them a severe lesson. In this country, no man or woman who is in health, should be respected, in our way of thinking, who will not work bodily or mentally, and who curl their lips with scorn when introduced to our working men.

bitterly repented the folly, who have turned  
their backs to honest industry. A few  
years of bitter experience taught them a  
serious lesson. In this country no man or  
woman should be respected, in our way of  
thinking, who would not work mentally or  
physically, and who curl their lips with  
scorn when introduced to hard-working  
men.

Would not Marry a Mechanic.  
A young man commenced visiting a  
young lady, and .seemed to be well  
pleased. One evening he called when it  
was quite late, which led the young lady  
to inquire where he bad been.  
. &quot;I had to work to-night&quot;  
&quot;What, do you work for a living?&quot; she  
inquired in astonishment  
&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the young man,  
&quot;I am a mechanic.&quot;  
&quot;I dislike the name of a mechanic,&quot;  
and she tnrned up her pretty nose.  
This was the last time the young man  
visited the young lady. Ue is now a  
wealthy man, and has one of the best  
women in the country for a wife.  
The young lady who disliked the  
name of a mechanic is now the wife of a  
miserable fool a regular vagrant about

miserable girl is obliged to take in wash

dren.You dislike the name of a mechanic,

dent, so soft, to think less of a young man  
for being a mechanic one of God&#x27;s no­  
blemen the most dignified and honora­  
ble personage of heaven&#x27;s creatures.  
Beware, young ladies, how you treat  
young men who work for a living, for  
you may one of these days be menial to  
one of them. Far better to discharge the  
well-fed patipsr with all his rings, jewel­
