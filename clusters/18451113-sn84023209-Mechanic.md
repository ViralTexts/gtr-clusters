Toe Mecuasic.=A young man commenc­  
ed visiting a young woman, und appeared to  
be well received. One evening hie called at  
the house when it was quite late, which led  
the gitl to inquire where he had been.  
* 1 had to work to-mght,” he replied.  
“ Do you work for a living 1&quot; inquired the  
astonished girl,  
  
--(&#x27;o-rminily.&quot; replied the young man, o]  
am a mechanie.”  
  
“ My brother doesn&#x27;t work, and 1 dislike  
the name of a mechanic,” and she turned up  
her pretty nose,  
That was the last time the mechanic visit­  
ed the young woman. He is now a wealthy  
man, and has one of the best women for his  
wife. The young woman, who disliked the  
vame of a mechunic, is now the wife of a  
miserable tool—a regular vagrant about grog­  
shops—and she, poor and miserable girl, is  
obliged to take in washing in order to support  
herself and children.  
  
Ye who dislike the name of a mechanic—  
whose brothers do nothing but loaf and dress  
—beware how you treat young men who work  
for a living. IPar better discard the well-fed  
pauper, with all his rings, jewelry, brazen­  
facedness and pomposity, and take to your af­  
fections the callous-handed, intelligent and in­  
dustrious mechanie. Thousands have bitter­  
ly regretted their folly, who have turped their  
backs on honest industry. A few years of  
bitter experience taught them a severe lesson.  
In this country no man or woman in health  
should be respected, in our way of thiuking,  
who will not work bodily or mentally, and  
who curl their lips with scorn when iutroduc­  
ed to hard working men.  
  
Hore.—So long as we possess the pewer  
to struggle, hope is the last feeling to desert  
the human mind Mea are endowed with  
every graduation of courage, from the calm  
energy of reflection, which is rendered still  
more eflfectize by physical firmness, to the  
headlong precipitation of a reckless spirit ;  
from the resolution that grows more impos­  
ing and more respectable as there is geeater  
occasion tor its exercise, to the tearful and il  
directed energies of despair. But no descrip­  
tion with the pen, can give the reader a just  
idea of the chill that comes over the heart  
when accidental canses rob us, suddenly and  
without notice, of those resources on which  
we have been habitually accustomed to rely.  
The mariner without his course or compass  
loses his audacity and cooluess, though the  
momentary danger be the same; the soldier  
will fly if you deprwve him of his arms ; and  
the hunter of our own forests, who has lost |  
s landmarks, is teansformed from the bold  
aud determined foe of its tenants into an anx­  
ious and dependent fugitive, timidly seeking  
the means of vetreat, lu shart, the customary  
associations of the mind being rudely and  
suddenly destroyed, we are made to feel that  
reason, while it elevates us so far above the  
brutes as to make man their lord and governor,  
becomes a quality less valuable than instinet,  
when the connecting liok in its chain of cau­  
ses and eflects 1s severed.

that somebody, else was made to work for them—  
to be (for it amounts lo this) their slave. Such  
persons, ten to one, will sooner or later, take practi¬  
cal lessons in their error, as did the young woman  
mentioned below. She who marries an honest,  
industrious mechanic, or other laborer, marties well.  
And if she have sense enough to think so, her hus¬  
band marries well.—[Gospel Fountain.

WOULDN’T MARRY A MECHANIC.  
  
Let every young lady read the following, and learn  
wisdom. Those who suppose they were made to live  
without work, must, of course, suppose that somebody  
else was made to work for them—to be (for it amounts  
to this) their slave. Such persons, ten to one, will  
sooner or later, take practical lessons in their error, as  
did the young woman mentioned below. She who  
marries an honest, industrious mechanic, or other la-  
borer, marries well ; and if she have sense enough to  
think so, her husband marries well.— Gospel Fountain.  
  
A young man commenced visiting a young woman,  
and appeared to be well pleased. One evening he  
called when it was quite late, which led the girl to  
inquire where he had been. .  
  
‘« T had to work to-night,” he replied.  
  
‘Do you work for a living ?”’ inquired the astonish-  
  
ed girl.  
  
‘* Certainly,”’ replied the young man: ‘I am a me  
chanic.”?  
  
‘* My brother doesn’t work, and I dislike the name  
of a mechanic ;”’ and she turned up her pretty nose.  
  
This was the last time the young mechanic visited  
the young woman. He is now a wealthy man, and has  
one of the best of women for his wife. The young  
lady who disliked the name of a mechanic, is now the |  
wife of a miserable fool—a regular vagrant about |  
greg-shops,—and she, poor, miserable woman, is|  
obliged to take in washing, in order to support herself  
and children.  
  
Ye who dislike the name of a mechanic—whose  
brothers do nothing but loaf and dress—beware how |  
you treat young men who work for a living. Far bet-_  
ter discard the well-fed pauper, with all his rings, |  
jewelry, brazenness and pomposity, and take to your |  
affection the callous-handed, intelligent and industrious |  
mechanic. Thousands have bitterly regretted the |  
folly, who have turned their backs to honest industry.  
A few years of bitter experience have taught them a |  
severe lesson. In this country no man or woman  
should be respected, inour way of thinking, who will  
not work bodily or mentally, and who curl their lips.  
with scorn when introduced to a hard working man. |

Wouldn&#x27;t Marry a Mechanic.  
A young man commenced visiting a  
young woman, and appeared to be well  
pleased. One evening he called when it  
was quite late, which ied the girl to inquire  
where he had been.  
&quot;1 had to work to-night.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the young man, &quot;I  
am a mechanic.&quot;  
&quot;My brother doesn&#x27;t work, and I dis  
like the name of a mechanic and she  
turned up iter pretty little nose.  
That was the last lime the young me­  
chanic visited the young woman.— He is  
now a wealthy mnn, and has one of the  
best of women for his wife. The young  
lady who disliked the name of a mechanic,  
is now the wife of a miserable fool—a  
regular vagrant about grog shops—and she,  
poor rr&gt;!S&quot;fabie girl, is obliged to take in  
wa-hing, in order to support herself and  
children.  
You dislike tho name of a mechanic—  
w hose brothers do nothing but loaf and  
dress—beware hw you treat young men  
who work for a living.—Far better discard  
the well fed pauper, with all his rings, jew  
elry, brazeness, and pomposity, and lake  
to your affections, the callous-handed, in­  
telligent and industrious mechanic. Thou­  
sands have bitterly legretted their folly,  
who have turned their backs on honest in­  
dustry. A few years of bitter experience  
have taught them a lesson. In this coun­  
t;y, no man or woman should be respected,  
in our way of thinking, w ho will not work  
bodily or menially, and who curl their bps  
with t-c -r.i w lien introduced to a hardwork

that ns they seem to have nothing to

gret it. It grieves my heart, and I know it  
will make the heart of your Great Father  
sad, to know that they are disposed to act  
in a manner that is so little for their own

“I have bet-ti to work to-night.”  
“Do yon work for a living ?” enquired

“Certainly,” replied the young man, “1  
am a mechanic.”  
  
“My brother doeen’t work, and I dislike  
the name of a mechanic,” and she turned  
up her pretty little noge.  
This was the last time he visited the  
young woman. He is now a wealthy man,  
atvl has one of the best of women for his

Tales.  
  
Wouldn’t Marry a Mechanic.  
  
A young man commenced visiting a  
young woman, and appeared to be well  
pleased. One evening he called when it  
was quite late, which led the lady to in­  
quire where he had been.  
‘ I had to work to-night.’  
‘ What ! —do you work for a living ?’  
she inquired with astonishment.  
‘ Certainly,’ replied the young man. ‘ 1  
am a mechanic.’  
‘ L dislike the name of mechanic,’ she  
said.  
  
That was the last time the young me­  
chanic visited the young woman. He is  
now a wealthy man, and has one of the  
best of women for a wife.  
  
The young lady who disliked the name  
of mechanic is uow the wife of a miserable  
fool, —a regular vagrant about grog-shops ;  
and she—soft, verdant, silly, miserable  
girl—is obliged to take in washing in order  
to support herself and children.  
You dislike the name of mechanic, eh ?  
you whose brothers are but dressed loaf­  
ers t We pity any girl who has so little  
brains, who is so verdant and soft as to  
think less of a young man for being a me­  
chanic ; one of God’s noblemen, —the most  
dignified and honorable personage of  
heaven’s creatures. Beware, young lady,  
how you treat the young men that work  
for a living, for you may one day be menial  
to one of them yourself.  
Far better discard the well-fed pauper,  
with all his rings, jewelry, brazenness, and  
pomposity, and take to your affections the  
callous-handed, intelligent, and industrious  
  
mechanic. Thousands havo bitterly re­  
gretted their folly, who have turned their  
backs to honesty. A few years have  
taught them a severe lesson. In this coun­  
try no man or woman should be respected

Wouldn’t Marry a Mechanic.—A young man  
began visiting a young woman, and appeared to  
be well liressed. One evening he called when it  
was quite late, which led the young girl to iur  
quire where he had been.  
“ I had to work to-night.”  
“ What ! do you work for a living?”  
“ Certainly,” replied the young man, “ I am a  
mechanic.”  
“I dislike the name of mechanic,” and she  
turned up her pretty nose.  
That was the last time the young man visited  
the young lady. He is now a wealthy man, ami  
has one of the best women in the country for a  
wife. The lady who disliked the name of me­  
chanic is now the wife of a miserable fool, a  
regular vagrant about grog shops, and the proud,  
verdant and miserable girl is obliged to take iu  
washing, in order to support herself and chil­  
dren.  
You dislike the name of mechanic, eh ? You,  
whose brothers are but well-dressed loafers !  
We pity any girl who has so little brains, who is  
so verdant, so soft, as to think less of a young  
man for being a mechanic—one of God&#x27;s noble­  
men—the most dignified and honorable person­  
age of God&#x27;s creatures. Beware, young lady,  
how you treat young men who work fora living,  
for you may one day lie menial to one of them  
yourself. Far better discharge the well-fed pau­  
per, with his rings, jewelry, brazenness and  
pomposity, and take to your affections, the cal­  
lous-handed, intelligent and industrious me­  
chanic. Thousands have bitterly regretted their  
folly who have turned their backs to honesty,  
A few years have taught them a severe lesson.

Beware, young ladies, how you treat

Far belter to discharge the well-fed  
pauper with all his rings, jewelry, bruz­

A young man began visiting a  
young lady recently, and was well  
pleased with her. Oueevening it was  
quite late when he called, and the  
young lady inquired where he had  
been.  
“I had to work to-night,” he said.  
“What! do you work for a living?”  
she inquired in astonishment.  
“Certainly,” replied the young man,  
“I am a mechanic.”  
“I dislike the word mechanic,” and  
she turned up her pretty nose.  
That was the last time tlie young  
man visited the young la ly. He is  
now a wealthy man, and has the  
nicest Utile wife in the city. The  
lady who disliked a mechanic is now1  
the wife of a miserable fool—a regu­  
lar fool—and the soft, miserable girl  
is obliged to take in washing to sup­  
port herself and children. You dis­  
like the name of mechanic, eh ?—you,  
whose brothers are but well-dressed  
loafers. Any girl is to be pitied who  
is so silly as to think less of a man  
because lie is a mechanic—one of  
God’s noblemen, a most dignified  
and honorable personage. Beware,  
young ladies, how you treat young  
men who work for a living, for you  
may be a menial to one of them your­  
seli. Far better discard the well-fed  
pauper, with all his jewelry, brazen­  
mss and pomposity, a d take your  
affections to the callous-handed,  
industrious mechanic. Thousands  
have bitterly repented their folly,  
who have turned their backs to hon­  
city. A few years have taught them  
a severe lesson. Labor is honorable  
in all, whether rich or poor.
