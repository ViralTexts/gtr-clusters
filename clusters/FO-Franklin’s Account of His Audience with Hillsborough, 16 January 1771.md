 I went this Morning to wait on Lord Hillsborough. The Porter at first deny’d his Lordship, on which I left my Name, and drove off. But before the Coach got out of the Square, the Coachman heard a Call, turn’d, and went back to the Door, when the Porter came and said, His Lordship will see you, Sir. I was shown into the Levee Room, where I found Governor Barnard, who I understand attends there constantly. Several other Gentlemen were there attending, with whom I sat down a few Minutes. When Secretary Pownall came out to us, and said his Lordship desired I would come in.  
I was pleas’d with this ready Admission, and Preference, (having sometimes waited 3 or 4 Hours for my Turn) and being pleas’d, I could more easily put on the open chearful Countenance that my Friends advis’d me to wear. His Lordship came towards me, and said “I was dressing in order to go to Court; but hearing that you were at the Door, who are a Man of Business, I determin’d to see you immediately.” I thank’d his Lordship and said that my Business at present was not much, it was only to pay my Respects to his Lordship and to acquaint him with my Appointment by the House of Representatives of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, to be their Agent here, in which Station if I could be of any Service—I was going on to say, to the Publick I should be very happy; but his Lordship whose Countenance chang’d at my naming that Province cut me short, by saying, with something between a Smile and a Sneer,  
  
L H.  
I must set you right there, Mr. Franklin, you are not Agent.  
  
B F.  
Why; my Lord?  
  
L.H.  
You are not appointed.  
  
B.F  
I do not understand your Lordship. I have the Appointment in my Pocket.  
  
L.H.  
You are mistaken. I have later and better Advices. I have a Letter from Governor Hutchinson. He would not give his Assent to the Bill.  
  
B.F.  
There was no Bill, my Lord; it is a Vote of the House.  
  
L.H.  
There was a Bill presented to the Governor, for the Purpose of appointing you, and another, one Dr. Lee, I think he is call’d, to which the Governor refus’d his Assent.  
  
B.F.  
I cannot understand this, my Lord. I think There must be some Mistake in it. Is your Lordship quite sure that you have such a Letter?  
  
L H.  
I will convince you of it directly. Rings the Bell. Mr. Pownall will come in and satisfy you.  
  
B.F.  
It is not necessary that I should now detain your Lordship from Dressing. You are going to Court. I will wait on your Lordship another time.  
  
L.H.  
No, stay, He will come in immediately. To the Servant. Tell Mr. Pownall I want him. Mr. Pownall comes in.  
  
L.H.  
Have not you at hand Govr. Hutchinson’s Letter mentioning his Refusing his Assent to the Bill for appointing Dr. Franklin Agent?  
  
SEC. P.  
My Lord?  
  
L H.  
Is there not such a Letter?  
  
SEC. P.  
No, my Lord. There is a Letter relating to some Bill for payment of Salary to Mr. DeBerdt and I think to some other Agent, to which the Governor had refus’d his Assent.  
  
L H.  
And is there nothing in that Letter to the purpose I mention?  
  
SEC. P.  
No, my Lord.  
  
B F.  
I thought it could not well be, my Lord, as my Letters are by the last Ships and mention no such Thing. Here is an authentic Copy of the Vote of the House appointing me, in which there is no Mention of any Act intended. Will your Lordship please to look at it? (With some seeming Unwillingness he takes it, but does not look into it).  
  
L H.  
An Information of this kind is not properly brought to me as Secretary of State. The Board of Trade is the proper Place.  
  
B.F.  
I will leave the Paper then with Mr. Pownall, to be—  
  
L.H.  
(Hastily) To what End would you leave it with him?  
  
B F.  
To be entred on the Minutes of that Board, as usual.  
  
L.H.  
(Angrily) It shall not be entred there. No such Paper shall be entred there while I have any thing to do with the Business of that Board. The House of Representatives has no Right to appoint an Agent. We shall take no Notice of any Agents but such as are appointed by Acts of Assembly to which the Governor gives his Assent. We have had Confusion enough already. Here is one Agent appointed by the Council, another by the House of Representatives; Which of these is Agent for the Province? Who are we to hear on Provincial Affairs? An Agent appointed by Act of Assembly we can understand. No other will be attended to for the future, I can assure you.  
  
B.F.  
I cannot conceive, my Lord, why the Consent of the Governor should be thought necessary to the Appointment of an Agent for the People. It seems to me, that—  
  
L H.  
(With a mix’d Look of Anger and Contempt) I shall not enter into a Dispute with you, Sir, upon this Subject.  
  
B F.  
I beg your Lordship’s Pardon. I do not presume to dispute with your Lordship: I would only say, that it seems to me, that every Body of Men, who cannot appear in Person where Business relating to them may be transacted, should have a Right to appear by an Agent; The Concurrence of the Governor does not seem to me necessary. It is the Business of the People that is to be done, he is not one of them, he is himself an Agent.  
  
L H.  
Whose Agent is he? (Hastily).  
  
B F.  
The King’s, my Lord.  
  
L H.  
No such Matter. He is one of the Corporation, by the Province Charter. No Agent can be appointed but by an Act, nor any Act pass without his Assent. Besides, This Proceeding is directly contrary to express Instructions.  
  
B.F.  
I did not know there had been such Instructions, I am not concern’d in any Offence against them, and—  
  
L H.  
Yes, your Offering such a Paper to be entred is an Offence against them. (Folding it up again, without having read a Word of it.) No such Appointment shall be entred. When I came into the Administration of American Affairs, I found them in great Disorder; By my Firmness they are now something mended; and while I have the Honour to hold the Seals, I shall continue the same Conduct, the same Firmness. I think My Duty to the Master I serve and to the Government of this Nation require it of me. If that Conduct is not approved, They may take my Office from me when they please. I shall make ’em a Bow, and thank ’em. I shall resign with Pleasure. That Gentleman knows it. (Pointing to Mr. Pownall.) But while I continue in it, I shall resolutely persevere in the same firmness. (Spoken with great Warmth, and turning pale in his Discourse, as if he was angry at something or somebody besides the Agent; and of more Importance) Consequence to himself.  
  
B.F.  
(Reaching out his Hand for the Paper, which his Lordship returned to him) I beg your Lordship’s Pardon for taking up so much of your time. It is I believe of no great Importance whether the Appointment is acknowledged or not, for I have not the least Conception that an Agent can at present be of any Use, to any of the Colonies. I shall therefore give your Lordship no farther Trouble. Withdrew

Iowent this morning ta walt on ford. ille  
borough. The porter at first denied his lord  
ship, on which I left my name and drove off.  
But before the coach got out of the square the  
coachman heard a call, turned and went back  
to the door, when the porter came and sald  
His lordship will see you, sir. I was shown  
into the dehth woom.hate I tound Governor  
Bernard, who, I understand, attends there con­  
stantly. Several other gentlemen were there  
attond  
attending, with whom I sat down a few min­  
utes, when Secretary Pownall came out to us  
and said his lordship desired I would come in  
I was pleased with this ready admission and  
preference, having sometimes waited three or  
four hours for my turn; and, being pleased, I  
could more easily put on the open, cheerful  
countenance that my friends adrlsed me to  
wear. His lordshin came toward me and  
said: &quot;I was dressing in order to go to court  
but, hearing that you were at the door, who  
are a man of business I determined to seo  
you immediately.&quot; I thanked his lordship  
and said that my business at present was not  
much; it was only to pay my respects to his  
Lordship, and to acquaint him with my ap  
pointment by the House of Representatives of  
Massachusetts Bay to b their agent here, in  
which station if I could be of any sorrlee   
ng on  
was going on to sny to the publle I should be  
very happy;&quot; but his lordship, whose counte­  
nance changed at my naming that province  
  
cut me short with something between a smile  
and a sneer  
and  
M. Tmust sot you right, there, MEFrank­  
lin, you are not agent.  
e wnnot agon  
L. H.-You are not appointed  
B.F.--I do not understand your lordship; I  
have the appointment in my pocket,  
L. H.You are mistaken; I have later and  
better advices, I have a letter from Gov Hutch  
inson; he would not give his assent to the bill.  
B. F.--There is no bill, my lord; it was a vote  
of the House  
L.I. Thore was a bill presented to the Gov­  
ernor for the purpose of appointing you and  
another one, Dr. Lee, I think he is called, to  
which the Governor refused his assent.  
P.F.uI cannot understand this my lord I  
cannot understand this my  
think there must be some mistake in it. Is  
your lordship quite sure that you have such a  
letter  
lefterI will convince you of it directly,  
hings the bell Mr. Pownall will come in and  
D.E. iIt is not necessary that I should now  
detain your lordship from dressing. You are  
going to court. I will wait on your lordsnin  
tme  
 B. No stay he will come immediately  
(To the servant.) Tell Mr. Pownall I want  
him. (Mr. Pownall comes in  
L, H.--Have not you at hand Gov. Hutchin  
son&#x27;s letter mentioning his refusing his assent  
mentioning  
to the hill for appointing br. Franklin asent  
In H.pls there not such a letter  
Sec. P.--No, my lord. There is a letter  
there is a letter relating to some bill for the  
parment of aaly t hi bn pert an  
think to some other agent, to which the Gove  
nor had refused his assent  
 H.And is there nothing in the letter to  
the purpose I mention?  
Sec. P.-No, my lord  
se I tomy on could not well be, my  
lord; as myletters are by the last ships, and  
they mention no such thing. Here is the  
authentic copy of the vote of the House ap­  
pointing me, in which there is no mention of  
any act intended. Will your lordship please  
to look at it? (With seeming unwillingness he  
takes it, but does not look into it.)  
L. H.--An information of this kind is not  
mroperly breught in e o sacrotar ot State  
The Board of Trade is the proper place.  
rowaandoil enre the ran ta a   
L. H. (hastily)- To what end would you leave  
it with him  
B. F.--To be entered on the minutes of that  
Board, as usual  
E.H tangrily. It shall not be ontered there  
No such paper shall be entered there while I  
have anything to do with the business of that  
Board. The House of Representatives has no  
right to appoint an agent. We shall take no  
notice of any agents but such as are appointed  
botie.  
by acts of Assembly, to which the Governor  
gives his assent. We have had confusion  
enough alreadyn Here is one agent apnointed  
by the Counell, another by the House of Rep  
resentates. Which of these is agent for the  
province? Who are we to hear in provincial  
affairs? An agent appointed by act of Assem­  
bly we can understand. No other will be at­  
tended to for the future, I can assure you  
B.W. I cannot concelve, my lord, why the  
consent of the Governor should be thought  
necessary for the appointment of an agent for  
the noople. It seeme to me that  
L. H. (with a mixed look of anger and con­  
tempt. I shall not enter into a dispute with  
vou, sir, upon this subject.  
E I beg your lordship&#x27;s pardon; I do not  
bes rour fordships naron  
presume to dispute with your lordship. I  
would only say that it seems to me that every  
body of men who cannot appear in person  
where business relating to them may be trans­  
acted should have a right to appear by an  
agent. The concurrence of the Governor does  
not seem to be necessary. It is the buciness of  
the people that is to be done. He is not one of  
them; he is himself an agent.  
L. H.-Whose agent is he­  
B. F.--The King&#x27;s, my lord.  
L. H.--No such matter. He is one of the cor.­  
poration by the province charter. No agent  
can be appointed but by an act, nor any act  
pass without his assent. Besides, this proceed  
ing is directly contrary to express instructions  
toeld ot anoe there had eech  
instructions. I am not concerned in any of­  
fence against them, and  
L. H.--Yes, your offering such a paper to be  
entered is an offence against them. (Folding  
It up again without having road a word of it  
No such appointment shall be entered. When  
I came into the administration of American af.­  
fairs I found them in great disorder. By mat  
firmness they are now something mended, and  
while I have the honor to hold the seals I shall  
continue the same conduct, the same firmness,  
I think my duty to the master I serve and to the  
flovernment of this nation requires it of me  
If that conduct is not approved they may take  
my office from me when they please. I shall  
make them a bow and thank them; I shall re­  
sign with pleasure. That gentleman knows it  
pointing to Mr fo whalld; but while I continue  
continne  
in it I shall resolutely persevere in the same  
frmness. (poken with great warmth, and  
turning pale in his discourse as if he was angry  
isent.  
at something or somebody besides the agent  
and of more consequence to himself.  
B. I reaching out his hand for the paper  
which his lordship returned to him) I beg  
your lordship&#x27;s pardon for taking up so much  
of your time. It is, I believe, of no great im  
portance whether the appointment is acknowl­  
edged or not, for I have not the least concep­  
tion that an agent can at present be of any use  
to any of the colonies. I shall theretors give  
your lordship no further trouble. Withdrew.
