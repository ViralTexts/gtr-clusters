Do you know you have asked for the costliest thing  
Ever made by the hand above?  
A woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life—  
And a woman&#x27;s wonderful love?  
  
Do you know you have asked for the priceless thing  
As a child might ask for a toy?  
Demanding what others have died to win,  
With the reckless dash of a boy?  
  
You have written my lesson of duty out—  
Man-like you have questioned me;  
Now stand at the bar of woman&#x27;s soul,  
Until I shall question thee.  
  
You require your mutton shall be always hot,  
Your socks and shirts be whole;  
I require your heart to be true as a God&#x27;s stars,  
And pure as Heaven your soul.  
  
You require a cook for your mutton and beef,  
I require a far greater thing;  
A seamstress you&#x27;re wanting for sock and for shirts,  
I look for a man and a king—  
  
A king for the beautiful realm called home,  
And a man that the Maker, God  
Shall look upon as He did on the first,  
And say, &quot;It is very good.&quot;  
  
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade,  
From my soft, young cheek one day—  
Will you love me then &#x27;mid the falling leaves  
As you did &#x27;mong the blooms of May?  
  
Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep  
I may launch my all on its tide!  
A loving woman finds heaven or hell  
On the day she is made a bride.  
  
I require all things that are good and true,  
All things that a man should be;  
If you give this all, I would stake my life  
To be all you demand of me.      
  
If you cannot be this—a laundress and cook  
You can hire, with little to pay;  
But a woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life  
Are not to be won that way.

From my soft young cheek some day;  
Will you love me &#x27;mid the falling leaves,  
As &#x27;you did &#x27;mid the bloom of May ?  
Is vour heart an ocean so strong and deep,  
T may launch my all upon its tide?  
A loving woman finds heaven or hell  
On the day she becomes a bride.  
I require all things that are good and true,  
  
All things that a man siiouia ne;  
If you give this all, I would stake niv life  
To be all you demand of me.  
If you cannot be this?a laundress and rook

 you know you have asked for  
this priceless thing As a child might  
ask for a toy? Demanding what others  
have died to win With the reckless dash  
of a boy ? You have written my lesson of  
duty out ; IMan like, you have  
questioned me ; Now stand at tihe bar of  
my woman&#x27;s soul Until I shall question  
thee. You reqluire your mutton shall  
always be hot, Your socks and your  
shirts be whole; I require your heart to  
be true as God&#x27;s stars, And as true as  
His heaven your soul. You require a cook  
for your mutton and beef ; I require a  
far greater thing A seamstress you&#x27;re  
wanting for socks and for shirts ; I  
look for a man and a king. A king for  
the beautiful realm called home, A man  
that the Maker, God, Shall look upon as  
He did on the first And say, &quot;1It is  
very good.&quot; I am fair and young, but the  
rose will fade From my soft yoesg cheek  
one day; Will you love me then, &#x27;mid the  
falling leaves, As you did &#x27;mid the  
blooms of MIay? Is your heart an ocean  
so strong and deep, I may launch my all  
on its tide? A loving woman finds heaven  
or hell On the day she becomes a bride.  
I require all the things that are grand  
and true, All things that a man should  
be ; If you give this all I will stake  
my life To be all you demand of me. If  
you cannot
