Do you know you have asked for the costliest thing  
Ever made by the hand above?  
A woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life—  
And a woman&#x27;s wonderful love?  
  
Do you know you have asked for the priceless thing  
As a child might ask for a toy?  
Demanding what others have died to win,  
With the reckless dash of a boy?  
  
You have written my lesson of duty out—  
Man-like you have questioned me;  
Now stand at the bar of woman&#x27;s soul,  
Until I shall question thee.  
  
You require your mutton shall be always hot,  
Your socks and shirts be whole;  
I require your heart to be true as a God&#x27;s stars,  
And pure as Heaven your soul.  
  
You require a cook for your mutton and beef,  
I require a far greater thing;  
A seamstress you&#x27;re wanting for sock and for shirts,  
I look for a man and a king—  
  
A king for the beautiful realm called home,  
And a man that the Maker, God  
Shall look upon as He did on the first,  
And say, &quot;It is very good.&quot;  
  
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade,  
From my soft, young cheek one day—  
Will you love me then &#x27;mid the falling leaves  
As you did &#x27;mong the blooms of May?  
  
Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep  
I may launch my all on its tide!  
A loving woman finds heaven or hell  
On the day she is made a bride.  
  
I require all things that are good and true,  
All things that a man should be;  
If you give this all, I would stake my life  
To be all you demand of me.      
  
If you cannot be this—a laundress and cook  
You can hire, with little to pay;  
But a woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life  
Are not to be won that way.
