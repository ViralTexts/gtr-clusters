Do you know you have asked for the costliest thing  
Ever made by the hand above?  
A woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life—  
And a woman&#x27;s wonderful love?  
  
Do you know you have asked for the priceless thing  
As a child might ask for a toy?  
Demanding what others have died to win,  
With the reckless dash of a boy?  
  
You have written my lesson of duty out—  
Man-like you have questioned me;  
Now stand at the bar of woman&#x27;s soul,  
Until I shall question thee.  
  
You require your mutton shall be always hot,  
Your socks and shirts be whole;  
I require your heart to be true as a God&#x27;s stars,  
And pure as Heaven your soul.  
  
You require a cook for your mutton and beef,  
I require a far greater thing;  
A seamstress you&#x27;re wanting for sock and for shirts,  
I look for a man and a king—  
  
A king for the beautiful realm called home,  
And a man that the Maker, God  
Shall look upon as He did on the first,  
And say, &quot;It is very good.&quot;  
  
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade,  
From my soft, young cheek one day—  
Will you love me then &#x27;mid the falling leaves  
As you did &#x27;mong the blooms of May?  
  
Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep  
I may launch my all on its tide!  
A loving woman finds heaven or hell  
On the day she is made a bride.  
  
I require all things that are good and true,  
All things that a man should be;  
If you give this all, I would stake my life  
To be all you demand of me.      
  
If you cannot be this—a laundress and cook  
You can hire, with little to pay;  
But a woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life  
Are not to be won that way.

A seamstress you’re wanting for socks and for  
shirts,  
I look for a man and a king.  
A king for the beautiful realm called home.  
And a man that the maker, God,  
Shall look upon as he did on the first.  
And say “It is very good.”  
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade  
From my soft young cheek one day—  
Will you love me then ’mid the falling leaves.  
As you did ’mong the bloom of May ?  
Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep  
I may launch my all on its tide ?  
A loving woman finds heaven or hell  
On the day she is made a bride.  
I require all things that are grand and true,  
All things that a man should be;  
If you give this all, I would stake my life  
To be all vou demand of me.  
If you cannot be this—a laundress and cook  
You can hire, and a little to pay;  
But a woman’s heart and a woman’s life.  
Are not won in that way.

A WOMAN’S ANSWERTO A MAN’S QUESTION.  
  
Do you know you have asked for the costliest thing  
Ever made by the hand above—  
  
A woman&#x27;s heart and a woman’s life,  
And a woman&#x27;s wonderful love?  
  
  
  
Do you know you have asked for this priceless thing,  
Asa child might ask for a toy,  
  
Demanding what others have died to win,  
With the reckless dash of a boy?  
  
You have written my lesson of duty out,  
Man-like have you questioned me—  
  
Now stand at the bar of my woman’s soul,  
Until I shall question thee.  
  
You require your mutton shall always be hot,  
Your socks and your shirt be whole;  
  
I require your heart to be true as God’s stars,  
And pure as his heaven your soul.  
  
You require a cook for your mutton and beef,  
I require a far greater thing;  
  
A seamstress you&#x27;re wanting for socks and for shirts,  
I look for a man and a king.  
  
A king for the beautiful realm called home,  
And a man that the maker, God,  
  
Shall look upon as he did on the first  
And say “It is very good.”  
  
lam fair and young, but the rose will fade  
From my soft young cheek one day—  
  
Will you love me then, ’mid the falling leaves,  
As you did ‘mid the bloom of May?  
  
Is your heart an Ocean, so strong and deep  
I may launch my all on its tide?  
  
A loving woman finds heaven or hell,  
On the day she is made a bride.  
  
I require all things that are grand and true,  
All things that a man should be;  
  
If you give this all, I would stake my life  
To be all you demand of me.  
  
If you cannot be this—a laundress and cook  
You can hire, with little to pay;  
  
But a woman’s heart and a woman&#x27;s life,  
Are not to be won that way.

Flowers in the garden without,  
  
Faint in the heat and the drought—

Iam fair and young, but the rose will fade  
From my soft, young cheek one day—  
  
Will you love me then, ’mid the falling leaves,  
As you did ’mid the bloom of May?  
  
Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep  
I may launch my all on its tide?

A Woman’s Answer.  
  
Do you know you have asked for the costliest  
- thing  
Ever made by the hand above— |  
A woman’s heart, and a woman’s life,  
And a woman’s wonderful love?  
  
Do you know you have asked for this priceless  
  
thing  
As a child might ask for a toy,  
Demanding what others have died to win,  
With the reckless dash of a boy ?  
  
You have written my lesson of duty out:  
  
- Man-like you have questioned me ;  
  
Now stand at the bar of my woman’s soul,  
Until I shall question thee.  
  
You require your mutton shall always be hot ;  
«Ae socks and your shirts be whole;  
  
I require your heart to be true as God&#x27;s stars,  
And pure as heaven your soul.  
  
You require a cook for your mutton and beef;  
I require a far greater thing ;  
A seamstress you&#x27;re wanting for socks and for  
shirts ;  
I look for a man and a king—  
  
‘A king for the beautiful realm called home, :  
And a man that the Maker, God, .  
Shall look upon as he did on the first,  
And say, “It is very good.”  
  
J am fair and young, but the rose will fade  
From my soft young cheeks one day ;  
  
Will you love me then, ’mid the falling leaves,  
As you did ’mid the bloom of May?  
  
Is your heart an ocean, so strong and deep  
i may launch my all_on its tide?  
  
A loving woman finds heaven or hell  
On the day she is made a bride.  
  
I require all things that are grand and true,  
All things thata man should be;  
  
If you give this all, I would stake my life  
To be all you demand of me;  
  
If you can not be this, a laundress and cook  
You can hire, with little to pay;  
But a woman’s heart and a woman’s love  
  
Are not to be won that way.

o a Man.  
Do you know you have asked for the costliest  
thing  
Ever made by the Hand above—  
A woman’s heart and a woman’s life  
And a woman’s wonderful love ?  
Do you know you have asked for this priceless  
thing  
As a child might ask for a toy ?  
Demanding what others have died to win,  
With the reckless dash of a boy.  
You have written my lesson of duty out,  
Man-like you have questioned me;  
Now stand at the bar of my woman’s soul,  
Until I shall question thee.  
You require your mutton shall always be hot,  
Your socks and your shirts shall be whole;  
I require your heart shall be true as God’s stars,  
And pure as Heaven your soul.  
You require a cook for your mutton and beef;  
I require far grander a thing ;  
A seamstress you’re wanting for stookings and  
shirts—  
I look for a man and a king.  
A king for a beautiful realm called home,  
And a man that the maker, God,  
Shall look upon as He did the first,  
And say, “It is very good.”  
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade  
From my soft, young cheek one day;  
Will you love me then, &#x27;mid the falling leaves,  
As you did ’mid the bloom of May ?  
Is your heart an ocean so strong and deep  
I may launch my all on its tide ?  
A loving woman finds Heaven or hell  
On the day she is a bride.  
I require all things that are grand and true,  
All things that a man should be;  
If you give this all I would stake my life  
To be all you demand of me.  
If you cannot do this, a laundress and cook  
You can hire with little to pay ;  
But a woman’s heart and a woman’s life  
Are not to be won that way.

A Womna&#x27;s Question. Do you know you have  
asked for. the ,ostltost thing E&#x27;er made  
by the hand above ? A woman&#x27;s heart and  
a woman&#x27;s life And a woman&#x27;s wonderful  
love ? Do you know you have asked for  
this priceless thing As a child might  
ask for a toy? Demanding what others  
have died to win With the reckless dash  
of a boy ? You have written my lesson of  
duty out ; IMan like, you have  
questioned me ; Now stand at tihe bar of  
my woman&#x27;s soul Until I shall question  
thee. You reqluire your mutton shall  
always be hot, Your socks and your  
shirts be whole; I require your heart to  
be true as God&#x27;s stars, And as true as  
His heaven your soul. You require a cook  
for your mutton and beef ; I require a  
far greater thing A seamstress you&#x27;re  
wanting for socks and for shirts ; I  
look for a man and a king. A king for  
the beautiful realm called home, A man  
that the Maker, God, Shall look upon as  
He did on the first And say, &quot;1It is  
very good.&quot; I am fair and young, but the  
rose will fade From my soft yoesg cheek  
one day; Will you love me then, &#x27;mid the  
falling leaves, As you did &#x27;mid the  
blooms of MIay? Is your heart an ocean  
so strong and deep, I may launch my all  
on its tide? A loving woman finds heaven  
or hell On the day she becomes a bride.  
I require all the things that are grand  
and true, All things that a man should  
be ; If you give this all I will stake  
my life To be all you demand of me. If  
you cannot be this, a laundress and cook  
You can hire, and little to pay.. But a  
woman&#x27;s heart and a woman&#x27;s life Are nut  
to ho won in that way.
