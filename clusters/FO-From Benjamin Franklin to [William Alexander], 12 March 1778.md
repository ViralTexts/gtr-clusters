 The fact was this.  
Some time in the winter of 1763–4 Mr. Grenville called together the agents of the several colonies, and told them that he purposed to draw a revenue from America, and to that end his intention was to levy a stamp duty on the Colonies by act of parliament in the ensuing session, of which he thought it fit that they should be immediately acquainted, that they might have time to consider, and if any other duty equally productive would be more agreeable to them, they might let him know it. The Agents were therefore directed to write this to their respective Assemblies, and communicate to him the answers they should receive: the agents wrote accordingly.  
I was a member in the Assembly of Pennsylvania, when this notification came to hand. The observations there made upon it were, that the ancient established and regular method of drawing aids from the Colonies was this. The occasion was always first considered by their sovereign in his privy council, by whose sage advice, he directed his secretary of state to write circular letters to the several Governors who were directed to lay them before their Assemblies. In those letters the occasion was explained for their satisfaction with gracious expressions of his majesty’s confidence in their known duty and affection, on which he relied that they would grant such sums as should be suitable to their abilities loyalty and zeal for his service. That the Colonies had always granted liberally on such requisitions, and so liberally during the late war, that the king sensible they had granted much more than their proportion, had recommended it to parliament five years successively to make them some compensation, and the parliament accordingly returned them £200.000 a year to be divided among them. That the proposition of taxing them in parliament was therefore both cruel and unjust. That by the constitution of the Colonies their business was with the King in matters of aid, they had nothing to do with any financier, nor he with them; nor were the agents the proper channels through which requisitions should be made; it was therefore improper for them to enter into any stipulation, or make any proposition to Mr. Grenville about laying taxes on their constituents by parliament, which had really no right at all to tax them, especially as the notice he had sent them did not appear to be by the King’s order and perhaps was without his knowledge; as the King when he would obtain any thing from them, always accompanied his requisition with good words, but this gentleman instead of a decent demand sent them a menace, that they should certainly be taxed, and only left them the choice of the manner. But all this notwithstanding they were so far from refusing to grant money that they resolved to the following purpose: “that they always had, so they also should think it their duty to grant aid to the crown, according to their abilities, whenever required of them in the usual constitutional manner.” I went soon after to England, and took with me an authentic copy of this resolution, which I presented to Mr. Grenville before he brought in the Stamp Act. I asserted in the House of Commons (Mr. Grenville being present) that I had done so, and he did not deny it. Other colonies made similar resolutions. And had Mr. Grenville instead of that act applied to the King in Council for such requisitional Letters to be circulated by the secretary of state, I am sure he would have obtained more money from the Colonies by their voluntary grants than he himself expected from his stamps. But he chose compulsion rather than persuasion, and would not receive from their good will what he thought he could obtain without it. And thus the Golden Bridge which the ingenious author thinks the Americans unwisely and unbecomingly refused to hold out to the minister and parliament, was actually held out to them, but they refused to walk over it. This is the true history of that transaction; and as it is probable there may be another edition of that excellent pa

¢ Some time in the winter of 1763-4, Mr. Grenville called  
together the agents of the several colonies and told them that he

was explained for their satisfaction, with gracious expressions of  
his Majesty’s confidence in their known duty and affection, on  
which he relied that they would grant such sums, as should be  
suitable to their abilities, loyalty, and zeal for his service. That  
the colonies had always granted liberally on such requisitions, and  
so liberally during the late war, that the King, sensible they had  
granted much more than their proportion, had recommended it to  
parliament five years successively to make them some compen-

by the constitution of the colonies their business was with the

proper for them to enter into any stipulation, or make any propo-  
sition to Mr. Grenville about laying taxes on their constituents  
by parliament, which had really no right at all to tax them,’ &amp;c.  
  
Though, however, the different houses of representatives in  
the North-American colonies protested against the exercise of  
the assumed right to tax them in a British parliament,  
  
‘ They were so far from refusing to grant money that they resolved  
to the following purpose: ‘ That they always had, so they always  
should think it their duty to grant aid to the crown, according to  
their abilities, whenever required of them in the usual consti-  
tutional manner.” I went’ soon after to England, and took with

As we have no doubt that the above extracts contain the  
true history of that transaction which, in its progress, alienated.

tify me in the distinction I would draw be-  
tween a requisition and @ tax. The col-  
onies by their constitution draw their  
charters from the king and have their own  
assemblies, which stand to them as the  
Parliament to England. The regular and  
ancient method of drawing aid from the  
colonies bas been for their sovereign, by  
the advice of his privy council, to dispatch  
circular letters, through his secretary of  
state, to the several governors, with direc-  
tions to lay them before their assemblies.  
These letters, after reciting the occasion for  
the requisition, called for such grants as  
were suitable to their abilities, loyalty, and  
zeal for the service. These requisitions  
had always been met by the colonies in a  
epirit of liberality; but it is a new thing  
and entirely contrary to the charter granted  
them for the Parliament to assume to ta
