**TWELVE WAYS OF COMMITTING SUICIDE.**  
  
1. Wearing of thin shoes and cotton stockings on damp nights, and in cool rainy weather. Wearing insufficient clothing, and especially upon the limbs and extremities.  
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid laziness, and keeping the mind in an unnatural state of excitement by reading trashy novels. Going to theaters, parties, and balls in all sorts of weather, in the thinnest possible dress. Dancing, till in a complete prespiration [sic], and then going home without sufficient over-garments, through the cool, damp air.   
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven-by-nine bed rooms, without ventilation at the top of the windows, and especially with two or more persons in the same small, unventilated bed-room.  
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating dinners. Eating in a hurry, without half masticating your food, and eating heartily before going to bed every night, when the mind and body are exhausted by the toils of the day, and the excitement of the evening.  
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and coffee, and going from one step to another chewing and smoking tobacco, and drinking intoxicating liquors. By personal abuse, and physical and mental excesses of every description.  
6. Marrying in haste and getting an uncongenial companion, and living the remainder of life in mental dissatisfaction. Cultivating jealousies and domestic broils, and being always in mental ferment.  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving paregoric and cordials, by teaching them to suck candy, and by supplying them with raisins, nut, and rich cake. When they are sick, by giving them *mercury, tartar emetic*, and *arsenic*, under the mistaken notion that they are medicines, and not irritant poisons.   
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb our minds, so as to leave no time to attend our health. Following an unhealthy occupation because money can be made by it.  
9. Tempting the appetite with bitters and niceties, when the stomach says No, and by forcing food when nature does not demand and even rejects it. Gormandizing between meals.  
10. Contriving to keep in a continual worry about something or nothing. Giving way to fits of anger.   
11. Being irregular in all our habits of sleeping or eating, going to bed at midnight and getting up at noon.—Eating too much, too many kinds of food, and that which is too highly seasoned.  
12. Neglecting to take proper care of ourselves, and not apply early for medical advise [sic] when disease first appears. Taking celebrated quack medicines to a degree of making a drug shop of the body.  
  
The above causes produce more sickness, suffering, and death, than all epidemics, malaria and contagion, combined with war, pestilence and famine. Nearly all who have attained an old age have been remarkable for equinimity of temper, correct habits of diet, drink, and rest—for temperance, cheerfulness, and morality. Physical punishment is sure to visit the transgressor of nature&#x27;s laws. All commit suicide, and cut off many years of their natural life, who do not observe the means for preventing disease, and of preserving health.—*American Medical and Surg. Journal*.

Twelve Ways of Committing Suicide.  
  
1. Wearing of thin slices and cotton stockings  
on damp nights, and in cool rainy weather.—  
Wearing insufficient clothing, and especially upon  
the limbs and extremities.  
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid laziness,  
and keeping the mind in an unnatural state of  
excitement by reading trashy novels. Going to  
theatres, parties and balls in all sorts of weather,  
in the thinnest possible dress. Dancing till in a  
complete perspiration, and then going home, with­  
out sufficient over-garments, through the cool,  
damp air.  
3. Sleeping on feather beds in sevcu-by-ninc­  
bed-rootns, without vent illation at the top of the  
windows, and especially with two or more per­  
sons in the same small unventillated bed room.  
4. A surfeiting on hot and very stimulating  
dinners. Kitting in a burry, without half mnsti­  
■eating the food, and eating heartily before going  
to bed every night, when the mind and body are  
exhausted by the toils of the day and the excite­  
went of the evening.  
5. Beginning iu childhood on ten and coffee,  
land going from one step to another, through  
chewing and smoking tobacco, and drinking in­  
toxicating liquors. By personal abuse, and physi­  
cal and mental exercises of every description.  
(5. Marrying in baste and getting an uncongenial  
companion, and living the remainder of life in  
mental dissatisfaction. Cultivating jealousies and  
domestic broils, and being always in a mental  
ferment.  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving paregoric  
and cordials, by teaching them to suck candy, and  
by supplying them with raisons, nuts and rich  
cake. When they are sick by giving them mer­  
cury. tartar emetic, amf arsenic, under the mis­  
taken notion that they are medicines and not irri­  
tant poisons.  
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb our  
minds, so as to leave no time to attend to our  
health. Following an unhealthy occupation be­  
cause money can lie made by it.  
t). Tempting the appetite with bitters and nice­  
ties when the stomach says Xo, and by forcing  
food into it when nature does not demand, and  
even rejects it. Gormandizing between meals.  
10. Contriving to keep in a continual worry  
about something or nothing. Giving way to tits  
of anger.  
11. Being irregular in all onr habits of sleeping  
and eating. Going to bed at midnight and get­  
ting up at noon. Eating too much, too many  
kinds of foods, and that which is too highly sea­  
soned,  
12. Neglecting to take proper care of ourselves  
and not apply early for medical advice when dis­  
ease tirst appears. Taking celebrated quack  
medicines to a degree of making a drug shop of  
the body.  
The above causes produce more sickness, suffer­  
ing and death than all the epidemics, malaria and  
contagion, combined with war pestilence and fam­  
ine. Nearly all who have attained to old age  
have been remarkable for equanimity of temper,  
correct habits of diet, drink and rest—for temper­  
ance, cheerfulness, and morality. Physical pun­  
ishment is sure to visit the transgressor of na­  
ture&#x27;s laws. All commit suicide and cut off’ many  
years of their natural life who do not observe  
the means of preventing disease and of observing  
health.—.im. -)/&lt;/. and Surgical Jour.

And it did work well. Captain Bar­  
rows remained with his sister a month,  
and then he went away. At the end  
of a year he came again, and this time  
he found Lydia as happy as a princess.  
Twelve Ways of Committing Suicide.  
  
1. Wearing of thin shoes and cotton  
stockings on damp nights, and in cool,  
rainy weather. Hearing insufficient  
clothing, and especially upon the  
limbs and extremities.  
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stuph  
laziness, and keeping the mind in an  
unnatural state of excitement bv read  
ing trdshv novels. Goiinr to theatres  
parties and balls in all sorts of weath  
er, 111 me tmnuest possible dress.  
Pancinflr, till 111 a complete perspira  
tion, and then going home, without  
uthcient over-garments, through the  
cool, drtmp air.  
?. Sleeping on feather beds in seven-  
bv-mne bed-rooms, without ventila  
tion at the top of the windows, and  
especially with two or more persons in  
the same small, unventilated bed  
room.  
4. Surfeitingon hot and very stimu  
lating dinners. Eating in a hurry,  
without half-masticating your food,  
and eating heartily before goingTto  
bed every night, when the mind and  
body are exhausted by the toils of the  
day and the excitement of the even-  
in ir.  
5. beginning in childhood on&quot; tea  
and coffee, and going from one step to  
another through chewing and smoking  
tobacco, and drinking intoxicating  
liquors. Hy personal abuse, and  
physical and mental excesses of every  
description.  
G. Marrring in haste aild getting  
an uncongenial companion, and living  
the remainder of lite in mental dis-  
atisfaction. Cultivating jealousies  
and domestic broils, and always in a  
mental ferment.  
7, Keeping children quiet by giv  
ing paregoric and cordials, by teach­  
ing them to suck candy, and by sup-  
minir them with raisins; nuts and  
rich cake. When they are sick, by  
!ng them mercury, tartar emetic  
and arsenic, under the mistaken notion  
fhat they arc medicines, and not irri  
tant posions.  
8. Allowing the love of gahi to ab­  
sorb our mindsj so?s to leave-.no time  
to attend to our health. Following  
an unhealthy occupation because  
money can be made by it.  
9. Tempting the appetite with bit­  
ters and niceties when the stomach  
says Noj and by forcing food when  
nature does not demand, aiid even re­  
jects it.  
10. Contriving to keep in a contin­  
ual worry about something or nothing.  
Giving way to fits of anger.  
11. Being irregular in all our habits  
of sleeping and fating. Going to bed  
at midnight and getting up at noon.  
Eating too much, too many kinds of  
food, and that which is too highly  
seasoned;  
12. Neglecting to take proper care  
of ourselves, and not apply early for  
medical advice when disease first ap­  
pears. Taking celebrated quack medi­  
cines to a degree of making a drug  
shop of the body.  
The above causes produce more  
sickness, suffering and death than all  
epidemics, malaria and contagion,  
combined with war, pestilence and  
famine. Nearly all who have attained  
to old age have been remarkable for  
equinamity of temper correct habits  
of diet, drink and &#x27; rest for temper­  
ance, cheerfulness and morality.  
Physical punishment is sure to visit  
the transgressor of nature&#x27;s laws.  
All commit suicide and cut off many  
years of their natural life who do not  
observe the means for preventing  
disease and of preserving health

Before those seven men left tho store that  
night, they pledged themselves never to tasto  
another glass of liquor, and never to play an­  
other game of . cards !  
Twelve Ways of Committing Indirect  
Suicide. 1. Wearing thin shoes and cotton  
stockings on damp nights, and iu cool rainy  
weather. &quot;Wearing insufficient clothing, es­  
pecially upon the limbs and extremities.  
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid la­  
ziness, and keeping tho mind in an unnatural  
stato of excitement by reading trashy novels.  
  
Going to theatres, parties and balls hi all sorts  
of weather, in the thinnest possible dress.  
Dancing till in a complete perspiration, and  
then going homo without sufficientover-garments  
through tho cool, damp air.  
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven by  
nino bed-rooms, without ventilation at tho  
top of tho windows, and especially with two  
or more persons in tho same small, unventi­  
lated bed-room.  
4. Surfeiting on hot and stimulating din­  
ners. Eating in a hurry, and not half masti­  
cating the food. Eating heartily before go­  
ing to bed every night, when tho mind and  
body are exhausted by tho toils of tho day  
and tho excitement of tho evening.  
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and cof­  
fee, and going from one step to another, thro  
chewing tobacco, and drinking intoxicating li­  
quors. By gross personal abuse, and physi­  
cal and mental excesses of every description.  
C. Marrying in hasto and getting an un­  
congenial companion, and living tho remain­  
der of life in mental dissatisfaction. Culti­  
vating jealousies and domestic broils, and be­  
ing always in a mental ferment.  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving pare­  
goric and cordials, by teaching them to suck  
candy, and by supplying them with raisins,  
nuts, and rich cake. When they are sick  
giving them mercury, tartar-emetic, and ar­  
senic, under tho mistaken idea that they arc  
medicines, and not irritant poisons.  
8. Allowing tho love of gain to absorb our  
minds, so leave no time to attend toour health.  
Following an unhealthy occupation because  
money can bo made by it.  
.9. Tempting tho appetite with bitters and  
niceties, when tho stomach plainly says NO,  
and forcing food into it when nature does not  
demand, and even rejects it. Gormandizing  
between meals.  
10. Contriving to keep in a continual wor­  
ry about something or nothing. Giving way  
to fits of anger.  
11. Being irregular in our habits of eating  
and sleeping. Going to bed at midnight and  
getting up at noon. Eating too much, too  
many different kinds of food, and that which  
is too highly seasoned.  
12. Neglecting to take the proper care of  
ourselves, and not ay plying for medical ad­  
vice when disease first appears. Taking cel­  
ebrated quack medicines to a degrco of mak­  
ing a drug shop of tho body.

clothing, especially on the limbs and ex­  
tremities.&#x27; 2. , Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid  
laziness and keeping the mind in an un­  
natural state of excitement by reading  
trashy novels. Going to theatres, parties  
and balls in all sorts of weather in the  
thinnest possible dress. Dancing till in  
complete perspiration, and then going  
home without sufficient over-garments,  
through the cool, damp night air.  
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven by  
nine bedrooms without ventilation at the  
top of the windows, and especially with  
two or more persons in the same small,  
unventilated bed room.

lating dinners. Eating in a hurry with­

Twelve Ways of Injuring the Health.  
  
1. Wearing of thin shoes and stockings on damp  
nighis and in cool rainy weather. Wearing insuf-  
ficient clothing, especially upon the limbs and ex-  
tremities.  
  
2. Leading a life of unfeeling,stupid laziness, and  
keeping the mind in an unnatural state of excitement,  
by reading trashy novels. Going to the theatres, par-  
ties and balls, in all sorts of weather in the thinnest  
dress: dancing tillin a complete perspiration, and  
then going home without sufficient overgarments,  
through the cool, damp night air.  
  
3. Sleeping on feather beds in 7x9 bed-rooms,  
without ventilation at the top of the window: espec-  
ially with two or more persons in the same small, un-  
ventilated bed-room.  
  
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating dinners;  
eating in a hurry, without half masticating the food,  
and eating heartily before going to bed, when the  
mind and body are exhausted by the toils of the day  
and the excitement of the evening.  
  
5. Beginning in childhood on strong tea and cof-  
fee, and going from one step to another, through  
chewing and smoking tobacco and drinking intoxi-  
eating liquors, and personal abuse, and mental and  
physical excesses of other kinds.  
  
6, Marrying in haste and getting an uncongenial  
  
  
  
companion, and living the remainder of life in mental  
dissatisfaction, cultivating jealousies and domestic  
broils, and being always in a mental ferment.  
  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving paregoric and  
cordials, by teaching them to suck candy, and by  
supplying them with raisins, nuts and rich cakes;  
when they are sick by giving them mercury, tartar  
emetic and arsenic, under the mistaken notion that  
they are medicines and not irritant poisons.  
  
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb our minds,  
so as to leave no time to attend to our health: follow-  
ing an unhealthy occupation, because money can be  
made by it.  
  
9. Tempting the appetite with bitters and niceties  
when the stomach says no, and by forcing food into  
it when nature does not demand, and even rejects it;  
gormandizing between meals.  
  
10. Contriving to keep a continual worry about  
something or nothing: giving away to fits of anger.  
  
11. Being irregular in ali habits of sleeping; and  
eating too much, too many kinds of food, and that  
which is too highly seasoned.  
  
12. Neglecting totake proper care of ourselves,and  
not applying early for medical advice when disease  
first appears, but by taking ‘‘celebrated” quack medi-  
cines to a degree of making a drug shop of the body.
