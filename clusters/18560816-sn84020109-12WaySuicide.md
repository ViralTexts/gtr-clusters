**TWELVE WAYS OF COMMITTING SUICIDE.**  
  
1. Wearing of thin shoes and cotton stockings on damp nights, and in cool rainy weather. Wearing insufficient clothing, and especially upon the limbs and extremities.  
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid laziness, and keeping the mind in an unnatural state of excitement by reading trashy novels. Going to theaters, parties, and balls in all sorts of weather, in the thinnest possible dress. Dancing, till in a complete prespiration [sic], and then going home without sufficient over-garments, through the cool, damp air.   
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven-by-nine bed rooms, without ventilation at the top of the windows, and especially with two or more persons in the same small, unventilated bed-room.  
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating dinners. Eating in a hurry, without half masticating your food, and eating heartily before going to bed every night, when the mind and body are exhausted by the toils of the day, and the excitement of the evening.  
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and coffee, and going from one step to another chewing and smoking tobacco, and drinking intoxicating liquors. By personal abuse, and physical and mental excesses of every description.  
6. Marrying in haste and getting an uncongenial companion, and living the remainder of life in mental dissatisfaction. Cultivating jealousies and domestic broils, and being always in mental ferment.  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving paregoric and cordials, by teaching them to suck candy, and by supplying them with raisins, nut, and rich cake. When they are sick, by giving them *mercury, tartar emetic*, and *arsenic*, under the mistaken notion that they are medicines, and not irritant poisons.   
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb our minds, so as to leave no time to attend our health. Following an unhealthy occupation because money can be made by it.  
9. Tempting the appetite with bitters and niceties, when the stomach says No, and by forcing food when nature does not demand and even rejects it. Gormandizing between meals.  
10. Contriving to keep in a continual worry about something or nothing. Giving way to fits of anger.   
11. Being irregular in all our habits of sleeping or eating, going to bed at midnight and getting up at noon.—Eating too much, too many kinds of food, and that which is too highly seasoned.  
12. Neglecting to take proper care of ourselves, and not apply early for medical advise [sic] when disease first appears. Taking celebrated quack medicines to a degree of making a drug shop of the body.  
  
The above causes produce more sickness, suffering, and death, than all epidemics, malaria and contagion, combined with war, pestilence and famine. Nearly all who have attained an old age have been remarkable for equinimity of temper, correct habits of diet, drink, and rest—for temperance, cheerfulness, and morality. Physical punishment is sure to visit the transgressor of nature&#x27;s laws. All commit suicide, and cut off many years of their natural life, who do not observe the means for preventing disease, and of preserving health.—*American Medical and Surg. Journal*.

Twelve Ways of Committing Indirect  
Suicide. 1. Wearing thin shoes and cotton  
stockings on damp nights, and iu cool rainy  
weather. &quot;Wearing insufficient clothing, es­  
pecially upon the limbs and extremities.  
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid la­  
ziness, and keeping tho mind in an unnatural  
stato of excitement by reading trashy novels.  
  
Going to theatres, parties and balls hi all sorts  
of weather, in the thinnest possible dress.  
Dancing till in a complete perspiration, and  
then going homo without sufficientover-garments  
through tho cool, damp air.  
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven by  
nino bed-rooms, without ventilation at tho  
top of tho windows, and especially with two  
or more persons in tho same small, unventi­  
lated bed-room.  
4. Surfeiting on hot and stimulating din­  
ners. Eating in a hurry, and not half masti­  
cating the food. Eating heartily before go­  
ing to bed every night, when tho mind and  
body are exhausted by tho toils of tho day  
and tho excitement of tho evening.  
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and cof­  
fee, and going from one step to another, thro  
chewing tobacco, and drinking intoxicating li­  
quors. By gross personal abuse, and physi­  
cal and mental excesses of every description.  
C. Marrying in hasto and getting an un­  
congenial companion, and living tho remain­  
der of life in mental dissatisfaction. Culti­  
vating jealousies and domestic broils, and be­  
ing always in a mental ferment.  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving pare­  
goric and cordials, by teaching them to suck  
candy, and by supplying them with raisins,  
nuts, and rich cake. When they are sick  
giving them mercury, tartar-emetic, and ar­  
senic, under tho mistaken idea that they arc  
medicines, and not irritant poisons.  
8. Allowing tho love of gain to absorb our  
minds, so leave no time to attend toour health.  
Following an unhealthy occupation because  
money can bo made by it.  
.9. Tempting tho appetite with bitters and  
niceties, when tho stomach plainly says NO,  
and forcing food into it when nature does not  
demand, and even rejects it. Gormandizing  
between meals.  
10. Contriving to keep in a continual wor­  
ry about something or nothing. Giving way  
to fits of anger.  
11. Being irregular in our habits of eating  
and sleeping. Going to bed at midnight and  
getting up at noon. Eating too much, too  
many different kinds of food, and that which  
is too highly seasoned.  
12. Neglecting to take the proper care of  
ourselves, and not ay plying for medical ad­  
vice when disease first appears. Taking cel­  
ebrated quack medicines to a degrco of mak­  
ing a drug shop of tho body.  
Tho abovo causes produce more sickness,  
suffering and death than all epidemics, mala­  
ria and contagion, combined with war, pesti­  
lence and famine. Nearly all who havo at­  
tained to an old Ago havo been remarkable  
for equanimity of temper, correct habits of  
diet, drink and rest for temperance, and  
cheerfulness, and for morality. Physical pun­  
ishment is sure to visit tho transgressor of  
nature&#x27;s laws. All commit suicido and cut  
off many years of their natural life who do  
not observo tho means of preventing disease  
and preserving health.

ety of the weed will assume a different  
character, being of liuer or coar.-er texture, as the  
case may be, light and bulky, and destitute of oil  
and substance. Tobacco of this description should  
be managed as before directed, but prised lightly in  
the casks so as to admit of a free and open leaf, such  
being mostly required for cigar leaf.  
  
There are several varieties of the w eed, but, as they  
all partake more or less of the same essential quali-  
fies uuder the same circumstances, it is unnecessa-  
ry to enumerate them — the difference being more in  
the choice or fancy of the planter than in any mate-  
rial difference in the growth and product of the va-  
riety, all requiring the same labor and attention, (  
and* the same cultivation and management. Cli-  
mate and soil have very much to do in forming the  
definite character of Tobacco, and seed of any vari-  
ety, token to another climate and a different soil, may  
produce a very different article, and observation  
and experiment alone upon the part of the planter  
can determine the best method of improving its  
character whilst becoming acclimated.  
  
I do not regard it necessary to extend this com-  
munication (already too long) to a greater length.

remainder of life in mental dissatisfaction.  
Cultivating jealousies and domestic broils,  
and being always in mental ferment.  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving  
paregoric and cordials ; by teaching them  
to suck candy, and by supplying them  
with raisons, nuts and rich cake. When

and not irritant poisons.  
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb

Nearly all who have attained to old age  
have been remarkable for equanimity of

morality. Physical punishment is sure  
to visit the transgressor of nature’s laws.

years of their natural life, who do not ob-_  
serve the means for preventing disease ~  
and of .preserving health.—

s the business  
is not good? Our farms are too large. Too  
few people are engaged in tilling the soil, and  
there is not one fifth as much fruit raised and  
eaten as there should be. Let more land be  
devoted to fruit and less to raising food for  
swine and for raising grain for whisky, and  
mankind will be less swinish and vastly more  
human, not to say angelic.  
  
It is not for ws to decide the respective merits  
of the numerous varieties. Suffice it to say,  
the best, nay, the very best, we have tasted this  
year were grown by Mr. Hyatt, of Morrisania,  
N. Y., and they were simply seedlings!  
  
——2 4 ee -  
  
TWELVE WAYS OF COMMITTING  
SUICIDE.  
  
A Meprcat cotemporary thus enumerates  
the fashionable modes of doing it:  
  
1. Wearing of thin shoes artPcotton stockings  
on damp nights and in cool, rainy weather.  
Wearing insufficient clothing, and especially  
upon the limbs and extremities.  
  
2. Leading a life of enfeebling, stupid laziness,  
and keeping the mind in an unnatural state of  
excitement by reading ge novels. Going  
to theaters, parties, and balls in all sorts of  
weather, in the thinnest possible dress. Danc-  
ing till in a complete perspiration, and then  
going home without sufficient over-garments,  
through the cool, damp night air.  
  
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven-by-nine  
bed-rooms, without ventilation at the top of  
the windows, and especially with two or more  
persons in the same small, unventilated bed-  
room.  
  
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating  
alinners. Eating in a hurry, without half mas-  
ticating the food, and eating heartily before  
going to bed, when the mind and body are ex-  
hausted by the toils of the day and the excite-  
ment of the evening.  
  
5. Beginning in childhood on tea and coffee,  
and going from one step to another, through  
chewing and smoking tobacco and drinkin  
intoxicating liquors; by personal abuse, an  
physical and mental excesses of other descrip-  
tions.  
  
6. Marrying in haste and getting an uncon-  
  
enial companion, and living the remainder of  
fife in mental dissatisfaction ; cultivating jeal-  
ousies and domestic broils, and being always  
in a mental ferment.  
  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving pare-  
goric and cordials, by teaching them to suck  
  
ying them with raisins,  
nuts, and rich cake; when they are sick by  
giving them mercury, tartar emetic, and arsenic,  
under the mistaken notion that they are medi-  
cines and not irritant poisons.  
  
8. Allowing the love of gain to absorb our  
minds, so as to leave no time to attend to our  
health ; following an unhealthy occupation be-  
cause money can be made by it.  
  
9. Tempting the appetite with bitters and  
niceties when the stomach says No, and by  
forcing food into it when nature does not de-  
mand, and even rejects it; gormandizing be-  
tween meals.  
  
10. Contriving to keep in a continual worry  
about something or nothing; giving way to  
fits of anger.  
  
- quavk medicines to a degree of i  
  
  
  
11. Being irregular in all our habits of sleep-  
ing and eating; going to bed at midnight and  
  
etting up at noon; eating too much, too many  
  
inds of food, and that which is too highly  
seasoned.  
  
12. Neglecting to take proper care of our-  
selves, and not apply early for medical advice  
when disease first appears; takin lebrated  
  
* a drug-  
shop of the body.  
  
The above causes produce more sickness,

abor was over. It is  
  
even said, (hat in the Spring of 1862 Mr. Lan­  
dis and a young man in bis office, were the  
only persons who received any letters. Those  
addressed to the young man were “ from the  
girl I left behind be,’* and came as regular as  
day and night.  
Some idea of the increase of the post office  
business can be formed from the fact that the  
amount due the department for three months,  
ending September 30th, 1862, was eight dollars  
and fifty cents, while for the three months,  
ending June 18th, 1866, the amount was one  
thousand seven hundred and forty-four dollars  
and seventeen cents.  
TWELVE WAYS OF COMMITTING

Wearing insufficient clothing, and especially

Dancing till in a complete perspiration, and  
then going home without sufficient over-gar­

persons in the same small, unventilated bed­  
room.  
4. Surfeiting on hot and very stimulating  
dinners. Eating in a hurry, without half mas­

THE HOSE DOCTOR.  
  
Eating Just Before Bed- Time.  
The ancient prejudice against eating  
just before going to bed is strongly con­  
demned by modern science, experience  
having shown it to be unfounded. There  
are exceptions to the rule but few-: peo­  
ple are injured and many positively bene­  
fitted by a slight repast before retiring.  
A glass of milk and a bificult er cracker  
is better than any hypnotic drag to put  
one to sleep, and in most cases may be  
taken without fear of &quot;nightmare&quot; or  
any other . form of distress. Going to  
bed &quot;on an empty stomach&quot; is a good  
way to invite sleeplessness and ultimate  
derangement of the digestive organs and  
general health. Cultivator.  
Twelve Ways of Injuring the Health.  
I. Wearing of thin shoes and stockings  
on damp nights and in coot, rainy  
l ii J 1 7 w  
weather: Wearing insufficient c.othing,  
and especially upon the limbs and ex­  
tremities. 2. Leading a life of unfeeling, stupid  
laziness, and keeping the mind in an un­  
natural state oftexcitement, by reading  
trashy novels. Going to the theatres,  
parties and balls, in all sorts of weather  
in the thinnest dress ; dancing till in a  
complete perspiration, and then going  
home without sufficient overgarments  
through the cool, damp night air.  
3. Sleeping on feather beds in seven  
bv&#x27; nine bed rooms, without ventilation  
at the topof the window; and especially  
with two or more persons in the same  
small unventilated bed room.  
4 Surfeiting on hot and very stimulat  
ihg dinners ; eating in a hurry, without  
half masticating the food, and eating  
heartily before going to bed, when the  
mind and body are exhaused by the toils  
of the dav and the excitement of the  
evening.  
5. Beginning in childhood on strong  
tea and coffee, and going from one step  
to another, through chewing and smok  
ing tobacco and drinking intoxicating  
liquors, and personal abuse, and mental  
and physical excesses of other kinds.  
6. Marrying m haste and getting an  
uncongenial companion, and living the  
remainder of life in mental dissatisfac­  
tion, cultivating jealousies and domestic  
broils, and being always in a mentil fer  
ment.  
7. Keeping children quiet by giving  
paragoric and cordials, by teaching them  
to suck candy, and by supplying them  
with raisins, nuts and rich cakes ; when  
they are sick by giving them mercury,  
tartar emetic and arsenic, under the mis  
taken notion that they are medicines and  
not irritant poisons.  
8. Allowing the love of gam to absorb
