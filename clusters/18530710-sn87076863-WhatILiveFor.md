I live for those that love me,    
For those I know are true,  
For the heaven that smiles above me,  
And awaits my spirit too;  
For all the human ties that bind me,  
For the task by God assign&#x27;d me,  
For the bright hopes left behind me,  
And the Good that I can do.  
  
I live to learn their story,  
Who&#x27;ve suffered for my sake,  
To emulate their glory,  
And follow in their wake;  
Bards martyrs, patriots, sages,  
The noble of all ages,  
Whose deeds crowd history&#x27;s pages,  
And time&#x27;s great volume make.  
  
I live to hail that season,  
By gifted minds foretold,  
When men shall live by reason,  
And not alone by gold—  
When man to man united,  
And every wrong thing righted,  
The whole world shall be lighted,  
As Eden of old.  
  
I live to hold communion  
With all that is divine,  
To feel there is a union  
&#x27;Twixt Nature&#x27;s heart and mine;

What I Live for.  
nY G. LINN EUS BANKS.  
I live for those whe love me,  
Whose hearts are kind and true;  
For the Heaven that smiles above me,  
And awaits my spirit too;  
For all human ties that bind me,  
For the task by God assigned me,  
For the bright hopes left behind me,  
And the good that I can do.  
I live to learn their story,  
Who suffered for my sake;  
To emulate their glory,  
And follow in their wake;  
Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages,  
The noble of all ages,  
Whose deed, crown History&#x27;s pages,  
And Time&#x27;s great volume make.  
I live to hold communion  
With all that is divine;  
To feel there is a union  
&#x27;Twixt Nature&#x27;s heart and mine:  
To profit by affliction,  
Reap truths from fields of fiction,  
Grow wiser from conviction,  
And fulfill each grand design.  
I love to hail that season,  
By givted minds foretold,  
When man shall live by reason,  
And not alone by gold;  
When man to man united,  
And every wrong thing righted,  
The whole world chall te lightod,  
As Eden was of old.  
I live for those who love me,  
For those who know me true.  
For the geaven that smiles above me,  
And awaits my spirit too;  
For the cause that lacks assistance,  
For the wrong that needs resistance,  
For the truth in the distance,  
And the good that I can do.

WIIAT I LIVE FODR.  
Dr. Guthrie used to say that there  
was more religion, good sense and  
poetry in the following than in all other  
similar efforts he had ever read:  
I live for those who love me,  
For those I know are true,  
For the heaven that smiles above me  
And awaits my spirit, too;  
For all human ties that bind me,  
For the task my God assigned me,  
For the bright hopes leff behind me,  
And the good that I can do.  
I live to learn their story,  
Who&#x27;ve suffered for my sake,  
To emulate their glory,  
And follow in their wake;  
Bards, matyrs, patriots, sages,  
The noble of all ages,  
Whose deeds crown history&#x27;s pages,  
And times great volume make.  
I live to hall that season  
By gifted minds foretold,  
When men shall live by reason,  
And not alone for gold.  
When man to man united,  
And every wrong thing righted,  
The whole world shall be lighted  
s Eden was of old.  
I live to hold communion  
With all that is divine.  
To feel that there is union  
Twixt Nature&#x27;s heart and mine,  
To profit by affliction.  
Reap truth from fields of fiction,  
row wiser from conviction  
Fulfilling God&#x27;s design.  
I live for those that love me,  
For those that know me true,  
For the heaven that smiles above me  
And waits my spirit, too;  
For the wrongs that need resistance,  
For the cause that needs assistance,  
For the future in the distance,  
And the good that I can do.
