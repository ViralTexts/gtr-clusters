I live for those that love me,    
For those I know are true,  
For the heaven that smiles above me,  
And awaits my spirit too;  
For all the human ties that bind me,  
For the task by God assign&#x27;d me,  
For the bright hopes left behind me,  
And the Good that I can do.  
  
I live to learn their story,  
Who&#x27;ve suffered for my sake,  
To emulate their glory,  
And follow in their wake;  
Bards martyrs, patriots, sages,  
The noble of all ages,  
Whose deeds crowd history&#x27;s pages,  
And time&#x27;s great volume make.  
  
I live to hail that season,  
By gifted minds foretold,  
When men shall live by reason,  
And not alone by gold—  
When man to man united,  
And every wrong thing righted,  
The whole world shall be lighted,  
As Eden of old.  
  
I live to hold communion  
With all that is divine,  
To feel there is a union  
&#x27;Twixt Nature&#x27;s heart and mine;  
To profit by affliction,  
Reap truths from fields of fiction,  
Grow wiser from conviction,  
And fulfill each great design.  
  
I live for those that love me,  
For those who know me true,  
For heaven that smiles above me,  
And awaits my spirit too;  
For the wrong that needs resistance,  
For the cause that lacks assistance,  
For the FUTURE in the distance,  
And the good that I can do.
