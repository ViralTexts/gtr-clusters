You will have heard before this reaches you, of the treacherous conduct . . . to the remaining people in Boston, in detaining their goods, after stipulating to let them go out with their effects; on pretence that merchants goods were not effects; the defeat of a great body of his troops by the country people at Lexington; some other small advantages gained in skirmishes with their troops; and the action at Bunker’s-hill, in which they were twice repulsed, and the third time gained a dear victory. Enough has happened, one would think, to convince your ministers that the Americans will fight, and that this is a harder nut to crack than they imagined.

She is now giving us such miserable specimens of  
her government, that we shall even detest and  
avoid it, as a complication of robbery, murder,  
famine, fire, and pestilence. If you flatter your-  
selves of beating us into submission, you know  
neither the people nor the country. You will  
have beard, before this reaches you, of the de-  
feat of a great body of your troops by the coun-  
try people at Lexington, of the action at Bunkerx’s  
hill, &amp;c. Enough has happened one would think,  
to convince your ministers, that the Americans
