Over the river they beckon to me—  
Loved ones who&#x27;ve crossed to the further side;  
The gleam of their snowy robes I see,  
But their voices are drowned by the rushing tide.  
There&#x27;s one with ringlets of sunny gold,  
And eyes the reflection of Heaven&#x27;s own blue;  
He crossed in the twilight, gray and cold,  
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.  
We saw not the angels that met him there;  
The gate of the city we could not see;—  
Over the river, over the river,  
My brother stands waiting to welcome me!  
  
Over the river the boatman pale,  
Carried another—the household pet;  
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale—  
Darling Minnie! I see her yet!  
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,  
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark;  
We watched it glide from the silver sands,  
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark.  
We know she is safe on the further side,  
Where all the ransomed and angels be;  
Over the river, the mystic river,  
My childhood&#x27;s idol is waiting for me.  
  
For none return from those quiet shores  
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale;  
We hear the dip of the golden oars,  
And catch a gleam of the snowy sail,—  
And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts;  
They cross the stream and are gone for aye:  
We may not sunder the vail apart  
That hides from our visions the gates of day.  
We only know that their barks no more  
May sail with us o&#x27;er life&#x27;s stormy sea;  
Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore,  
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me!  
  
And I sit and think, when the sunset&#x27;s gold  
Is flushing river and hill and shore,  
I shall one day stand by the water cold,  
And list for the sound of the boatman&#x27;s oar:  
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail;  
I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand;  
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,  
To the better shore of the spirit land;  
I shall know the loved who have gone before,  
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,

Over the Uiver.  
  
BY MISS NANCY A. W. PRIKST.  
  
Tlie following is ono of those beautiful  
poems which will live for ever:  
Over the river they beckon to me—  
Wed ones who’ve crossed to the further side •  
Hie (fleam of their snowy robes I sec,  
but their voices are drowned in the rushing  
tide. *  
There’s one with ringlets of sunny gold,  
And eyes the reflection ofheaven’s own blue;  
He crossed in the twilight gray and cold.  
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.  
” e saw not the angels that met him there ;  
The gate of the city we could not see ;  
Over the river, over the river,  
My brother stands waiting to welcome me •  
Over the river the boatman pale  
Carried another—the household pet;  
llcr brown curls waved in the gentle gale—  
Hurling Minnie! I see her yet!  
She crossed on her bosom her&quot; gentle hands,  
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark;  
We watched it glide from the silver sands,  
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark.  
tV e know she is safe on the further side,  
o here all the ransomed and nugcls he ;  
Over the river, the mystic river,  
My childhood’s idol is waiting for me,  
For none return from those quiet shores  
Who cross with the boatman cold aud pale;  
We hear the dip of the golden oars,  
And catch a glimpse of the snowy sail.  
And lo! they have passed from our yearning  
hearts;  
They cross the stream and are gone for aye.  
We may not suuder the veil apart  
Thut hides from our vision the gates of day.  
We only kuow that their barks no more  
T May sail with us o&#x27;er life’s stormy sea;  
et somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore,  
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.  
And I sit and think when the sunset’s gold  
In flushing river, and hill and shore,  
I shall stand one day by the water cold,  
And list for the sound of the boatman’s oar;  
I shall watch for the gleam of the flapping soil,  
I shall hear the boat as it nears the strand :  
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,

The following touchingly beautiful poem

We think we have printed it heretofore, but

The gleam of their snowy robes I see,  
But their voices are drowned in the rushing  
tide

I shall ass from sii&#x27;ht, with the boatman pale.  
To the better shore of the spirit land,  
I shall know the loved who have gone before  
And Joyfully sweet will the meeting be.  
When over the river, the peaceful river. .

The gleam of their snowey robes I see,  
But their voices are lost by the dashing tide.  
There&#x27;s one with the ringlets of sunny gold.  
And eyes the reflection of Heaven&#x27;s own blue;  
He crossed in the twilight gray and cold.  
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.  
We saw not the angels that met him there,  
The gate of the city we could not eee;  
Over the river, over the river.  
My brother stands waiting to welcome me!

Carried another, the household pet;  
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale—  
Darling Jessio, 1 see her yeti  
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,  
And fer.rlesssly entered the phantom bark;  
We watched it glide from the silver sands;  
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark,  
W’e know she is safe on the further side.  
Where all the ransomed and angels be;  
Over the river, the mystic river.  
My childhood&#x27;s idol is waiting for me.  
For none return from those quiet shores  
Who cross with the boatman cold and pole;  
WTc hear tho dip of the golden oars.  
And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts:  
They cross the stream and are gone for aye;  
We may uot sunder the veil apart  
That hides from our vision the gates of day.  
We only know that their barks no more  
May sail with us o&#x27;er life&#x27;s stormy sea.  
Yet somewhere, I known on the unseen shore,  
They watch and beckon, and wait for me!  
And I sit and think when the sunset&#x27;s gold  
Is flushing river, and hill, and shore,  
I shall one day stand by the water cold.  
And list for the sound of the boatman&#x27;s oar.  
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail;  
1 shall hear the boat as it gains the strand;  
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale.

JPoetry,  
Over the River.  
Over the river they beckon to me—  
Loved ones who&#x27;ve crossed to the farther side;  
The gieam of their snowy robes I see,  
But their voices aro drowned in the rushing  
tide.  
There&#x27;s one with locks of burnished gold,  
And eyes the embodiment of jet&#x27;s own hue;  
He crossed in the twilight gray and cold,  
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view,  
We saw not the angels that met him there I  
The gate of the city we could not see-  
Over tho river, over the river,  
My darling stands waiting to welcome me.  
Over tho river the boatman pale  
Carried another—the household pet!  
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale—  
Darling Rosey! I see hor yet.  
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands.  
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark;  
We watched it glide from tho silver sands,  
And all our sunshine grew suddenly dark.  
We know she is safe on the other side,  
Where all the ransomed angela be ;  
Over the river, the mystic river.  
My household idol is waiting for me.  
For none return from those quiet shore 9  
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale.  
Vi c hear the dip of the golden oar 3,  
And catch a glimpse of the snowy sail,  
And lo! they have passed from our yearning  
hearts,  
They cross the streams and are gone for aye;  
We may not sunder the vail apart  
That hides from our vision the gatos of day ;  
We only know that their barks no more  
Sails with us o&#x27;er life&#x27;s stormy sea ;  
Tot somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore  
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.  
And I sit and think when tbe sunset&#x27;s gold  
Is flushing river, and hill, and shore  
I shall one day stand by the water cold  
And list for the sound of tho boatman&#x27;s oar.  
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail;  
I shall hear the boat as it nears the strand;  
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale  
To the better shore of the spirit land.  
I shall know the loved who have gono before.  
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be-  
When over the river, the mystic river,  
The angel death shali carry me.
