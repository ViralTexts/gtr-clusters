Over the river they beckon to me—  
Loved ones who&#x27;ve crossed to the further side;  
The gleam of their snowy robes I see,  
But their voices are drowned by the rushing tide.  
There&#x27;s one with ringlets of sunny gold,  
And eyes the reflection of Heaven&#x27;s own blue;  
He crossed in the twilight, gray and cold,  
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.  
We saw not the angels that met him there;  
The gate of the city we could not see;—  
Over the river, over the river,  
My brother stands waiting to welcome me!  
  
Over the river the boatman pale,  
Carried another—the household pet;  
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale—  
Darling Minnie! I see her yet!  
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,  
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark;  
We watched it glide from the silver sands,  
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark.  
We know she is safe on the further side,  
Where all the ransomed and angels be;  
Over the river, the mystic river,  
My childhood&#x27;s idol is waiting for me.  
  
For none return from those quiet shores  
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale;  
We hear the dip of the golden oars,  
And catch a gleam of the snowy sail,—  
And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts;  
They cross the stream and are gone for aye:  
We may not sunder the vail apart  
That hides from our visions the gates of day.  
We only know that their barks no more  
May sail with us o&#x27;er life&#x27;s stormy sea;  
Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore,  
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me!  
  
And I sit and think, when the sunset&#x27;s gold  
Is flushing river and hill and shore,  
I shall one day stand by the water cold,  
And list for the sound of the boatman&#x27;s oar:  
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail;  
I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand;  
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,  
To the better shore of the spirit land;  
I shall know the loved who have gone before,  
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,  
When over the river, the peaceful river,  
The angel of Death shall carry me!

Over the river they beckon to me—  
  
Loved ones who’ve crossed to the further side ;  
The gleam of their snowy robes I see,  
  
But their voices are lost by the dashing tide.  
There’s one with ringlets of sunny gold,  
  
And eyes, the reflection of heaven’s own blue;  
He crossed in the twilight, gray and cold,  
  
And the pale light hid him from mortal view,  
We saw not the angels that met him there,  
The gate of the city we could not see ;—  
Over the river, over the river,  
  
My brother stands waiting to weleome me!  
  
Over the river the boatman pale  
  
Carried another, the household pet ;  
  
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale—  
Darling Minnie! I see her yet!  
  
She crossed on her bossom her dimpled hands,  
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark ;  
We watched it glide from the silver sand,  
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark,  
We know she is safe on the further side,  
Where all the ransomed and angels be;  
Over the river, the mystic river,  
  
My childhood idol is waiting for me.  
  
For none return from those quiet shores  
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale ;  
We hear the dip of the golden oars,  
  
And catch a glimpse of the snowy sail,  
  
And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts,  
They cross the stream, and are gone for aye.  
We may not sunder the veil apart,  
  
That hides from our vision the gates of day,  
We only know that their barks no more  
  
May sail with us o’er life&#x27;s stormy sea,  
  
Yet somewhere, I know on the unseen shore,  
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me!  
  
And I sit and think when the sunset’s gold  
Is flushing river, and hill, and shore,  
  
I shall one day stand by the water cold,  
  
And list for the sound of the boatman’s oar.  
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail ;  
I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand ;

I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,  
To the better shores of the spirit land.  
  
I shall know the loved who have gone before,  
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,  
When over the river, the peaceful river,

And the pale mist hid him from mortal view ;  
We eaw not the angels who met him there,  
  
The gates of the city we could not see,  
Over the river, over the river,  
  
My brother stands waiting to welcome me.  
  
Over the river the boatman pale  
Carried another, the houeehold pet ;  
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale,  
Darling Minnie! I eee her yet.  
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,  
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark,  
We felt it glide from the silver sands,  
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark ;  
We know she is safe on the further side,  
Where all the ransomed and angels be ;  
Over the river, the mystic river,  
My childhood’s idol is waiting for me.  
  
For none return from those quiet shores,  
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale ;  
We hear the dip of the golden oars,  
And catch a gleam of the snowy sail;  
And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts,  
They cross the stream and are gone for aye.  
We may not sunder the vail apart  
That hides from our vision the gates of day,  
We only know that their barks no more ©  
May sail with us o’er life’s stormy sea;  
Yet somewhere I know on the unseen shore,  
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.  
  
And I sit and think when the sunset’s gold  
Is flushing river and hill and shore,  
I ehall one day stand by the water cold  
And list for the sound of the boatman’s oar ;  
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail,  
I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand,  
Tehal] pass from sight with the boatman pale,  
To the better shore of the spirit land.  
I shall know the loved who have gone before,  
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,  
When over the river, the peaceful river,

Over the river, they beckon to me,  
&#x27; Loved ones &quot;who have pass&#x27;d to the other side;  
The gleam of their snowy robes I see,  
But their voices are lost in the dashing tide.  
There&#x27;s one with ringlet? of sunny gold,  
And eyes the reflection of Ileaven&#x27;s own blue;  
He crossed in the twilight, gray and cold,  
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.  
We saw not the angels that met him there,  
The gates of the city we could not see  
Over the river, over the river,  
My brother stands ready to welcome me.  
Over the river the boatman pale,  
Carried another the household pet ;  
Her bright curls waved in the gentle gale  
Darling Mamie, I see her yet 1  
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,  
  
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark ;  
We watched from the silver sands,  
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark,  
We know she is safe cu the other side,  
Where all the ransomed and angels be;  
Over the river, the. mystic river,  
My childhood&#x27;s idol3 are waiting fcr me.  
For none return from those quiet shores,  
Who cross with the boatman, cold and pale ;  
We hear the dip of the golden oar3,  
We catch a gleam of the snowy sail.  
And lo ! they have passed from our heart :  
They cross the stream and are gone for aye!  
  
We cannot sunder the veil apart,  
  
That hides lrompur vision the gates of day;  
  
We only know that their barks no more  
  
Shall sail with ours on life&#x27;s stormy sea!  
Yet somehow on the unseen shore,  
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.  
And I sit and think, when the sunset&#x27;s gold  
: Is flushing river and hill and shore,  
I shall one day stand by the water cold,  
And list to the sound of the boatman&#x27;s oar.  
I shall watch for the gleam of the flapping sail,  
I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand ;  
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,  
To the belter shore of the Spirit Land !  
I shall know the loved who have gone before,  
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,  
When over the river, the peaceful river,  
The angel of death shall carry me !

OYEK THE RIVER. Over the river they  
beckon to ine, — Loved ones who&#x27;ve  
crossed to the further side, The gleam  
of their snowy robes I see, But their  
voices are lost in the dashing tide.  
There&#x27;s one with ringlets of sunny gold,  
And eyes the reflection of heaven&#x27;s own  
blue ; He crossed in the twilight grey  
and cold, And the pale mist hid hira  
from mortal view ; We saw not the angels  
who met him there, I The gates of the  
city could not see, — Over the river,  
over the river, My brother stands  
-waiting to welcome me ! Over the river  
the boatman pale Carried another, the.  
household pet ; &#x27; Her brown curls wave  
in the gentle gale, Darling Minnie ! I  
see her yet. She crossed on her bosom  
her mmpled hands, j And fearlessly  
entered the phantom bark ; We felt it  
glide from the.silver sands, And all our  
sunshine grew strangely dark ; We know  
she is safe on the further side, Where  
all the ransomed and angels be : Over  
the river, the mystic river, My  
childhood&#x27;s idol is waiting for me. For  
none return from those quiet ahores, Who  
cross with the boatman cold and pale ;  
We hear tbe dip of the golden oars, And  
catch a gleam of the snowy sail ; And lo  
! they have passed from our yearning  
heart, They cross the stream and are  
gone for aye : We may not .sunder the  
veil apart That hides from our vision  
tiie gates of day ; We only know that  
their barks no more May sail with ns  
o&#x27;er life&#x27;s stormy sea : Yet somewhere.  
I -know, on the unseen-shore They watch,  
and beckon, and wait for mo. -; And I  
sit and think when the snnset&#x27;a gold Is  
flushing river, and hill, and shore I  
shall one day stand by the water cold,  
And list for the sound of the boatman&#x27;s  
oar ; I shall watch for a gleam of the  
flapping sail. I shall hew the boat as  
it gains the strand, I shall pass from  
sight with the boatman pale, To the  
better 6hore of the spirit land : 1  
shall know the loved who have gone  
before, And joyfully sweet will the  
meeting be, . When over the river, the  
peaceful river, The Angel of Death shall  
carry me.
