London, June 22. 1767  
Capt. Falkener is arriv’d, and came yesterday to see me, and bring my Letters. I was extreamly glad of yours, because I had none by the Packet.  
It seems now as if I should stay here another Winter, and therefore I must leave it to your Judgment to act in the Affair of your Daughter’s Match as shall seem best. If you think it a suitable one, I suppose the sooner it is compleated, the better. In that case, I would only advise that you do not make an expensive feasting Wedding, but conduct every thing with Frugality and Oeconomy, which our Circumstances really now require to be observed in all our Expences; For since my Partnership with Mr. Hall is expired, a great Source of our Income is cut off; and if I should lose the Post Office, which among the many Changes here is far from being unlikely, we should be reduc’d to our Rent and Interest of Money for a Subsistence, which will by no means afford the chargeable Housekeeping and Entertainments we have been used to; for my own Part I live here as frugally as possible not to be destitute of the Comforts of Life, making no Dinners for any body, and contenting my self with a single Dish when I dine at home; and yet such is the Dearness of Living here in every Article, that my Expences amaze me. I see too by the Sums you have received in my Absence, that yours are very great, and I am very sensible that your Situation naturally brings you a great many Visitors which occasion an Expence not easily to be avoided, especially when one has been long in the Practice and Habit of it: But when People’s Incomes are lessened, if they cannot proportionably lessen their Outgoings, they must come to Poverty. If we were young enough to begin Business again, it might be another Matter; but I doubt we are past it; and Business not well managed ruins one faster than no Business. In short, with Frugality and prudent Care  we may subsist decently on what we have, and leave it entire to our Children: but without such Care, we shall not be able to keep it together; it will melt away like Butter in the Sunshine; and we may live long enough to feel the miserable Consequences of our Indiscretion.  
I know very little of the Gentleman or his Character, nor can I at this Distance. I hope his Expectations are not great of any Fortune to be had with our Daughter before our Death. I can only say, that if he proves a good Husband to her, and a good Son to me, he shall find me as good a Father as I can be: but at present I suppose you would agree with me that we cannot do more than fit her out handsomely in Cloaths and Furniture, not exceeding in the whole Five Hundred Pounds, of Value. For the rest, they must depend as you and I did, on their own Industry and Care: as what remains in our Hands will be barely sufficient for our Support, and not enough for them when it comes to be divided at our Decease.

Sally Franklin is well; her Father who had not seen her for a twelve month, came lately and took her home with him for a few Weeks to see her Friends; he is very desirous I should take her with me to America.  
I suppose the blue Room is too blue, the Wood being of the same Colour with the Paper, and so looks too dark. I would have you finish it as soon as you can, thus. Paint the Wainscot a dead white; Paper the Walls blue, and tack the gilt Border round just above the Surbase and under the Cornish. If the Paper is not equal Coloured when pasted on, let it be brush’d over again with the same Colour: and let the Papier machée musical Figures be tack’d to the middle of the Cieling; when this is done, I think it will look very well.  
Who is the Mrs. Morris you mention, as Mother to Dr. Rush[?] I am glad my Recommendations were of any Service to him.  
I am glad to hear that Sally keeps up and increases the Number of her Friends. The best Wishes of a fond Father for her Happiness always attend her. I am, my dea

 LoNDON, 22 June, 1767  
$5e MY DEarCHILD, Capt Falconeris arrived, and  
came straight to see me and bring me letters. I  
was extremely glad of yours, because I had  
 none by the packet. it soemt now asitI should  
 stay here another winter, and therefore I must  
ave it to your indgment to act in the affair of  
 our daughters match as shall seom bost if  
rou think it is a suitable one I suppose the  
a tooner it is completed the better. in that case  
s I would advise that you do not make an expen  
t sive feasting wedding, but conduct everything  
 with frugality and economy, which our circum  
os stances now require to be observed in all our  
S0 axpenses; for since my partnership with Mr.  
32e Hall is expired a great source of our income is  
btre gut off, and if I should leave the Tost offce  
d which among the many changes here is far  
atee from being unlikely, we should bo reduced  
to our rents and intemst of money for a sub  
 e e e  e e o  
 chargeable housekeeping and entertainmonts  
we have been used to.  
 For my own part, I live here as frugally as  
e o a o te o  
life making no dianers for anybodr, and con  
$3 tonting myself with a single dish when I dine  
at home. And yet, such is the dearness of liy  
ing here in every article, that  
ing here in every article, that my exponses  
amare me. I see, too, by the sums you have  
received in my absence that yours are very  
at, and I am very sensible that your situa  
&quot;tion naturally brings you a great many visit  
naturally brings you a great many visite  
ors, which occasion an expense not easlly to  
be avoided, espocially when one has been long  
in the practice and habit of it. But when peo­  
e e   te o­  
portionately lessen their outgoings, they must  
come to poverty. If we were young enough to  
t begin business again it might be another mat­  
ter; but I doubt we are passed it, and business  
 not well managed ruins one faster than no bus­  
 iness. In short with frugality and proper care  
1ls we may subsist decently on what we have, and  
leave it entire to our children; but without  
such care we shall not be able to keep it to  
gether; it will melt awav like butter in the  
I sunshine, and we may live long enough to feel  
the miserable consequences of our indiscretion  
 I know verr little of the gentleman or his  
 character, nor can I at this distance. I hope  
 his expectations are not great of any fortune  
 to be had with our daughter before our death  
I can only sar that, if he proves a good hus  
band to her and a good son to me, he shall find  
 me as good a father as I can be but at present  
4 I suppose you would agree with me, that we  
 cannot do more than fit her out handsomely in  
 clothes and furniture, not exceeding in the  
 whole 2500 of value. For the rest they must  
I depend as you and I did, on their own industry  
Es092? and care, as what remains in our hands will be  
 barely sufficient for our support and not  
s enough for thom when it cones to be divided  
 at our deceas
