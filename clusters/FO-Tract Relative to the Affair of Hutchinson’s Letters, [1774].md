. It has long appeared to me that the only true British Politicks were those which aim’d at the Good of the Whole British Empire, not those which sought the Advantage of one Part in the Disadvantage of the others. Therefore All Measures of procuring Gain to the Mother Country arising from Loss to her Colonies, and all of Gain to the Colonies arising from or occasioning Loss to Britain, especially where the Gain was small and the Loss great; every Abridgement of the Power of the Mother Country where that Power was not prejudicial to the Liberties of the Colonists, and every Diminution of the Priviledges of the Colonists, where they were not prejudicial to the Welfare of the Mother Country, I in my own Mind condemned as improper, partial, unjust, and mischievous, tending to create Dissensions, and weaken that Union, on which the Strength, Solidity, and Duration of the Empire greatly depended.

) into the Nature of the Connection between Britain and the Colonies, I became convinced, that the Bond of their Union is not the Parliament but the King. That in removing to America, a Country out of the Realm, they did not carry with them the Statutes then existing; for if they did, the Puritans must have been subject there to the same grievous Acts of Conformity, Tithes, Spiritual Courts, &amp;c. which they meant to be free from, by going thither; and in vain would they have left their native Country and all the Conveniencies and Comforts of its improved State, to combat the Hardships of a new Settlement in a distant Wilderness, if they had taken with them what they meant to fly from, or if they had left a Power behind them capable of sending the same Chains after them, to bind them in America. They took with them, however, by Compact, their Allegiance to the King, and a Legislative Power for the making a new Body of Laws, with his assent, by which they were to be governed. Hence they became distinct States, under the same Prince, as Scotland and England were before the Union, as Ireland is, as Jersey, Guernsey, and Hanover are, governed each by its own Laws, and by the same Sovereign; having each the Power of Granting their own Money to that Sovereign, and the Privilege of not being taxed but by their own Representatives.

Those as little acquainted with Law as I was, (who indeed never before had a Suit of any kind) may wonder at this as much as I did.

I do not understand this, unless it be for the Encouragement of Business.  
My Answer upon Oath was, That the Letters in question were given to me, and came into my Hands as Agent for the House of Representatives of the Province of Massachusetts Bay; that when given to me I did not know to whom they had been addressed, no Address appearing upon them; nor did I know before that any such Letters existed; that I had not been for many Years concern’d in Printing; that I did not cause the Letters to be printed, nor direct the doing it; that I did not eraze any Address that was [interlined: might have been] on the Letters, nor did I know that any other Person had made such Erazure; that I did as Agent to the Province transmit, (as I apprehended it my Duty to do) the said Letters to one of the Committee with whom I had been directed to correspond, inasmuch as in my Judgment they related to Matters of gr

inquiry into the nature of the connection be­  
tween Britain and the colonies, I am con­  
vinced that the foundation is not the Parlia­  
ment, but the king. That in removing to  
America, a country out of the realm, they  
did not carry&#x27; with them the statutes then  
existing, for, if they did, the Puritans must  
have been subject there to the same griev­  
, qus,. act of conformity, tithes, spiritual  
courts, etc., which they became free from  
by. going thither. In vain would they have  
left their native country and all the con­  
veidences and comforts of its improved  
state to come to the hardships of a new  
settlement in a distant wilderness if they  
had taken with them what they intended to  
fly from, or if they had left a power behind  
them capable of sending the same chains  
after them to bind them in America. They  
tock with them, however, by compact, their  
allegiance to the king and a legislative low­  
er for the making of a new body of laws  
with his assent, by which they were to be  
governed. Hence they became distinct  
tntva united as Ireland Is to the crown,  
but not to the realm, and governed by their  
own laws, though with the same sovereign  
and having eacii the right of granting its  
own money to that sovereign.  
This reasoning was essentially adopted,  
by all of those who denied the supremacy  
of the English Parliament. As we shall  
see, they did not refine it very much, but  
were satisfied to rest their opposition on  
the general proposition that taxation with­  
out representation was in violation of their  
rights as Englishmen. The early charters  
treated the settlers as adventurers, and

It has long appeared to me that the only true  
British policy was that which aimed at the good  
of the whole British empire, not that which sought  
the advantage of one part in the disadvantage of  
the others; therefore all measures of procuring  
gain to the mother country arising from loss to  
her colonies, and all of gain to the colonies aris-  
ing from or occasioning loss to Britain, especially  
where the gain was small and the loss great, every  
abridgment of the power of the mother country,  
where that power was not prejudicial to the  
liberties of the colonists, and every diminution  
of the privileges of the colonists, where they  
were not prejudicial to the welfare of the mo-  
ther country, I, in my own mind, condemned  
as improper, partial, unjust, and mischievous,  
tending to create dissensions, and weaken that  
union on which the strength, solidity, and dura-
