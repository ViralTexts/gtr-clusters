**The Value of Lemons**  
  
Somebody who appears to know all about it writes positively that it will draw the sting of the hot weather, not only for this time, but for months to come, to understand the right use of lemons. Most people know the benefit of a lemonade before breakfast, but few know how it is more than doubled by taking another at night also. The way to get the better of all bilious systems without blue pill or quinine, is to take juice of one, two or three lemons, as the appetite craves, in as much ice water as makes it pleasant to drink, without sugar, just before going to bed. In the morning on rising, or at least half an hour before breakfast, take the juice of one lemon in a goblet of water. This will clear the system of humors and bile with mild efficacy, without any of the weakening effects of calomel or Congress water. People should not irritate their stomachs by eating lemons clear; the powerful acid of the juice, which is almost corrosive, infallibly produces inflammation after awhile, but properly diluted, so it does not burn or draw the throat, it does its full medicinal work without harm, and taken when the stomach is clear of food has oppor­tunity to work on the system thor­oughly.

his bride cannot be expected yet to en­

A good deal has been said lately  
through the papers about tho health­  
fulness of lemons. The latest advice  
bow to use them so they will do tho  
most good runs as follows: Most peo­  
ple know tho benefit of lemonade be­  
fore breakfast, but few know how it is  
more than doubled by taking another  
at night also. The way to get tho bet­  
ter of a bilious system without blue  
pills or quinine is to take tho juice of  
one, two or throe lemons, as the appe­  
tite craves, in as much ice water as it  
is pleasant to drink, without sugar, be­  
fore going to bed. In the morning on  
rising, or at least half an hour before  
breakfast, tako the juice of ono lemon  
in a goblet of water. That will clear  
the system of humors and bile, with  
mild efficacy, without any of tho  
weakening effects of calomel or Con­  
gress water. People should not irri­  
tate tho stomach by eating the lemons  
clear; the powerful acid juice, which  
is almost corrosive, infallibly produces  
inflammation after a while; but prop­  
erly diluted, so that it does not burn  
or draw tho throat, it does its full  
medicinal work without harm, and
