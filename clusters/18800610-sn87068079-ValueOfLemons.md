**The Value of Lemons**  
  
Somebody who appears to know all about it writes positively that it will draw the sting of the hot weather, not only for this time, but for months to come, to understand the right use of lemons. Most people know the benefit of a lemonade before breakfast, but few know how it is more than doubled by taking another at night also. The way to get the better of all bilious systems without blue pill or quinine, is to take juice of one, two or three lemons, as the appetite craves, in as much ice water as makes it pleasant to drink, without sugar, just before going to bed. In the morning on rising, or at least half an hour before breakfast, take the juice of one lemon in a goblet of water. This will clear the system of humors and bile with mild efficacy, without any of the weakening effects of calomel or Congress water. People should not irritate their stomachs by eating lemons clear; the powerful acid of the juice, which is almost corrosive, infallibly produces inflammation after awhile, but properly diluted, so it does not burn or draw the throat, it does its full medicinal work without harm, and taken when the stomach is clear of food has oppor­tunity to work on the system thor­oughly.

As the hot summer weather is upon  
us, it is well to understand  
that the  
right use of lemons may be

A I em­

anl the  
benefits will be Increased by repeating  
the dose at night.  
A medical authority affirms that the  
way to get the better of all bilious  
symptoms without pill or quinine,  
is to take the juice of one, two or  
three lemons as the appetite craves,  
in as much ice-water as makes it  
pleasant to drink, without sugar, just  
before going to bed. Iir the morning  
on rising, or at least a half hour before  
breakfast, take the juice of one lemon  
in a goblet of water. This will clear  
the system of humors and bile, with  
mild efficacy, &quot; without any of the  
weakening effects of medicines.  
People should not irritate their  
stomachs by eating lemons clear, the  
powerful acid of the juice, which is  
almost corrosive, infallibly produces  
intlamation after awhile, but properly­  
diluted, so that it does not burn or

Eating LemonS.  
A good deal has been said through the pa­  
pers about the healthfulness of lemons. The  
latest advice as to how to use them so they will  
do the most good runs as follows: Most peo­  
ple know the benefit of lemonade before break­  
fast, but few know how it is more than dou­  
bled by taking another at night, alse. The  
way to get the better of a bilious system with­  
out blue pills or quinine, is to take the juice  
of one, two or three lemons, as the appetite  
craves, in as much ice-water as makes it pleas­  
ant to drink, without sugar, before going to  
bed. In the morning on rising, or at least  
half an hour before breakfast, take the juice  
of one lemon in a goblet of water. This will  
clear the system of humors and bile, with  
mild efficacy, without any of the weakening  
eflects of calomel or Congress water. People  
should not irritate the stomach by eating lem­  
ons clear; the powerful acid of the juice,  
which is almost corrosive, infallibly produces  
inflammation after a while, but properly i­  
luted, so that it does not burn or draw the  
throat, it does its full medicinal work without  
harm, and when the stomach is clear of food

BENEFIT OF LEMONADE.  
Somebody, who appears to know  
all about it, writes positively that it  
will draw the sting out of hot  
weather, not only for this time, but  
for months to come, to understand  
the right use of lemons. Most peo­  
ple know the benefit of lemonade  
before breakfast, but few know how  
it is more than double by taking at  
night also. The way to get the bet­  
ter of a billious system without blue

The Beauty of the Lemon.  
&quot;v&quot;  
A few years ago the drink known as  
&quot; sour seltzer,&quot; -or seltzer and lemon &quot;  
was uninvented. It is growing more and  
more popular every day ; and it is, well  
that it is. Nothing else, is so cooling  
nothing else cools so quickly and with  
such lasting effect. It seems that lemon  
is a better drug than it used to get credit  
for. We are told that the way to get the  
better of a bilious system&#x27; withPut bluo  
pill or quinine is to take the juice of one,  
two or three or more lemons, as the appe­  
tite craves, in as much ice-water as makes  
it pleasant to drink without sugar befpro  
going to bed. , In the morning on rising,  
or least half an our before breakfast,  
take the juice of one lemon in a goblet of &#x27;  
water. This will clear the system 6f hu­  
mors and bile with mild efficacy, without  
any of tke weakening effects of calomel  
or Congress water. People should not ir­  
ritate the stomach by eating lemons clear ;  
the, powerful acid of the juice, which is  
almost corrosive, infallibly produces infla­

Benefit of Lemons.  
Most people know the benefit of lemon­  
ade before breakfast, but few know how it  
is more than doubled by taking another  
at night, also. The way to get the better  
of a bilious system without blue pills or  
quinine, is to take the juice of one, two or  
three lemons, as the appetite craves, in as  
much ice-water as to make it pleasant to  
drink, without sugar, before going to bed.  
In the morning on rising, or at least half  
an hour before breakfast, take the juice of  
one lemon in a goblet of water. This will  
clear the system of humors and bile, with  
mild efficacy, without any of the weaken­  
ing effects of Congress water. People  
should not irritate the stomach by eating  
the lemons clear; the powerful acid of the  
juice, which is almost corrosive, infallibly  
produces ioflamation after a while; but  
properly diluted, so that it does not burn  
or draw the throat, it does its full medical  
work without harm, and when the stomach  
is clear of food has abundant opportunity

HOW TO USE LEMONS.   
A good deal has been said through  
the papers lately about the healthful­  
ness of lemons. The latest advice as  
to how to use them so they will do the  
most good runs as follows: “ Most  
people know the benefit of lemonade  
before breakfast, but few know how it  
is more than doubled by taking one at  
night also. The way to get the better  
of a bilious system without blue pills  
or quinine is to take the juice of one,  
two or three lemons, as the appetite  
craves, in as much ice-water as makes  
it pleasant to drink, without sugar, be­  
fore going to bed. In the morning, on  
rising, or an hour before ,breakfast,  
take the juice of one lemon in a goblet  
or water. This will clear the system  
of humors and bile, with mild efficacy,  
without any of the weakening ten­  
dency of calomel or congress water.  
People should not irritate the stomach  
by eating the lemon clear; the power­  
ful acid of the juice, which is almost  
corrosive, infallibly produces inflamma­  
tion after a while, but properly dilu­  
ted, so that it does not burn or draw  
the throat, it does its full medical work  
without any harm, and when the  
stomach is clear of food has abundant  
opportunity&#x27; to work on the system  
thoroughly.

Eating Lemons.—a good deal has been  
said through the papers lately about the  
health-fuluess of lemons. The latest ad­  
vice as to how to use them so that they will  
do the most good runs as follows:  
Most people know the benefit of a lem­  
on before breakfast, but few know how it is  
more than doubled by taking another at  
night, also. The way to get the better of  
a billious system without blue pills or qui­  
nine, is to take the juice of one, two or  
three lemons as the appetite craves, in as  
much ice-water as makes it pleasant to  
drink, without sugar, before going to bed.  
In the morning on rising, or at least half  
an hour before breakfast, take the juice of  
one lemon in a goblet of water. This will  
clear the system of humors and bile, with  
mild efficacy, without any of the weaken­  
ing effects of calomel or congress water.  
People should not irritate the stomach by  
eating lemons clear; the powerful acid of  
the juice, which is almost corrosive, infal­  
» libly produces inflammation after a while,  
but properly diluted, so that it does not  
burn or draw the throat, it does its full  
, medicinal work without harm, and when  
, the stomach is clear of food has abundant  
opportunity to work on the system thor­  
oughly.

CURE FOR BILIOUSNESS­  
The way to get the better of the bilious  
system without blue pills or quinine is to  
take the juice of one, two or three lemons,  
as appetite craves, in as much water as  
makes it pleasant to drink without sugar,  
before going to bed. In the morning, on  
rising, at least half an hour before break­  
fast, take the juice of one lemon in a gob­  
let of water. This will clear the system  
of humor and bile with efficiency, without  
any of the weakening effects of calomel.  
People should not irritate the stomach by  
eating lemons clear ; the powerful acid of  
the juice, which is always most corrosive,  
invariably produces inflammation after a  
while, but properly diluted, so that it does  
not burn or draw the throat, it does its  
medical work without harm, and, when  
the stomach is clear of food, has abundant  
opportunity to work over the system thor­  
oughly.—Medical News.
