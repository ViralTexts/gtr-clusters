the typographical unions of the state.  
  
THE Neat Printer says California has been trying the plan of the  
state printing text books for the public schools, and it does not seem to  
work very well. The books are considered not well printed, and it is  
charged that the state superintendent has tried to work into the hands of  
the private text book publishers. The people of the state are con-  
siderably exercised over the matter, and have arranged for an indignation  
meeting.
