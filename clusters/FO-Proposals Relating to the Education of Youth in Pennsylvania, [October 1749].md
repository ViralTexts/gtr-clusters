Mr. Locke says, p. 234. “When your Son can write well and quick, I think it may be convenient not only to continue the Exercise of his Hand in Writing, but also to improve the Use of it further in Drawing; a Thing very useful to a Gentleman on several Occasions; but especially if he travel; as that which helps a Man often to express in a few Lines well put together, what a whole Sheet of Paper in Writing would not be able to represent and make intelligible. How many Buildings may a Man see, how many Machines and Habits meet with, the Ideas whereof would be easily retain’d, and communicated by a little Skill in Drawing; which being committed to Words, are in Danger to be lost, or at best but ill retained in the most exact Descriptions? I do not mean that I would have him a perfect Painter; to be that to any tolerable Degree, will require more Time than he can spare from his other Improvements of greater Moment. But so much Insight into Perspective and Skill in Drawing, as will enable him to represent tolerably on Paper any Thing he sees, except Faces, may, I think, be got in a little Time.”

I would therefore advise all Gentlemen to learn perfectly Merchants Accounts; and not to think ’tis a Skill that belongs not to them, because it has received its Name, and has been chiefly practis’d by Men of Traffick.” p. 316.

, speaking of Grammar, p. 252. says, “That to those the greatest Part of whose Business in this World is to be done with their Tongues, and with their Pens, it is convenient, if not necessary, that they should speak properly and correctly, whereby they may let their Thoughts into other Mens Minds the more easily, and with the greater Impression. Upon this Account it is, that any sort of Speaking, so as will make him be understood, is not thought enough for a Gentleman. He ought to study Grammar, among the other Helps of Speaking well, but it must be The Grammar of his Own Tongue, of the Language he uses, that he may understand his own Country Speech nicely, and speak it properly, without shocking the Ears of those it is addressed to with Solecisms and offensive Irregularities. And to this Purpose Grammar is necessary; but it is the Grammar only of their own proper Tongues, and to those who would take Pains in cultivating their Language, and perfecting their Stiles. Whether all Gentlemen should not do this, I leave to be considered, since the Want of Propriety and Grammatical Exactness is thought very misbecoming one of that Rank, and usually draws on one guilty of such Faults, the Imputation of having had a lower Breeding and worse Company than suits with his Quality. If this be so (as I suppose it is) it will be Matter of Wonder, why young Gentlemen are forc’d to learn the Grammars of foreign and dead Languages, and are never once told of the Grammar of their own Tongues. They do not so much as know there is any such Thing, much less is it made their Business to be instructed in it. Nor is their own Language ever propos’d to them as worthy their Care and Cultivating, tho’ they have daily Use of it, and are not seldom, in the future Course of their Lives, judg’d of by their handsome or awkward Way of expressing themselves in it. Whereas the Languages whose Grammars they have been so much employed in, are such as probably they shall scarce ever speak or write; or if upon Occasion this should happen, they should be excused for the Mistakes and Faults they make in it. Would not a Chinese, who took Notice of this Way of Breeding, be apt to imagine, that all our young Gentlemen were designed to be Teachers and Professors of the dead Languages of foreign Countries, and not to be Men of Business in their own.” Page 255. the same Author adds, “That if Grammar ought to be taught at any Time, it must be to one that can speak the Language already; how else can he be taught the Grammar of it? This at least is evident from the Practice of the wise and learned Nations among the Antients. They made it a Part of Education to cultivate their own, not foreign Tongues. The Greeks counted all other Nations barbarous, and had a Contempt for their Languages. And though the Greek Learning grew in Credit amongst the Romans towards the End of their Commonwealth, yet it was the Roman Tongue that was made the Study of their Youth: Their own Language they were to make Use of, and therefore it was their own Language they were instructed and exercised in.” And p. 281. “There can scarce be a greater Defect (says he) in a Gentleman, than not to express himself well either in Writing or Speaking. But yet I think I may ask the Reader, whether he doth not know a great many, who live upon their Estates, and so, with the Name, should have the Qualities of Gentlemen, who cannot so much as tell a Story as they should, much less speak clearly and persuasively in any Business. This I think not to be so much their Fault as the Fault of their Education.” Thus far Locke.

 the Precepts I have mentioned. Hath the Child arrived to six or seven Years of Age, he mixes with a Herd of ill-bred Boys at School, where under the Pretext of Teaching him Latin, no Regard is had to his Mother Tongue. And what happens? What we see every Day. A young Gentleman of eighteen, who has had this Education, Cannot Read. For to articulate the Words, and join them together, I do not call Reading, unless one can pronounce well, observe all the proper Stops, vary the Voice, express the Sentiments, and read with a delicate Intelligence. Nor can he speak a Jot better. A Proof of this is, that he cannot write ten Lines without committing gross Faults; and because he did not learn his own Language well in his early Years, he will never know it well. I except a few, who being afterwards engaged by their Profession, or their natural Taste, cultivate their Minds by Study. And yet even they, if they attempt to write, will find by the Labour Composition costs them, what a Loss it is, not to have learned their Language in the proper Season.

g Letters  
  
‡This Mr. Locke recommends, Educ. p. 284. and says, “The Writing of Letters has so much to do in all the Occurrences of human Life, that no Gentleman can avoid shewing himself in this Kind of Writing. Occasions will daily force him to make this Use of his Pen, which, besides the Consequences that, in his Affairs, the well or ill managing it often draws after it, always lays him open to a severer Examination of his Breeding, Sense and Abilities, than oral Discourses, whose transient Faults dying for the most Part with the Sound that gives them Life, and so not subject to a strict Review, more easily escape Observation and Censure.” He adds,  
  
“Had the Methods of Education been directed to their right End, one would have thought this so necessary a Part could not have been neglected, whilst Themes and Verses in Latin, of no Use at all, were so constantly every where pressed, to the Racking of Childrens Inventions beyond their Strength, and hindring their chearful Progress by unnatural Difficulties. But Custom has so ordained it, and who dares disobey? And would it not be very unreasonable to require of a learned Country Schoolmaster (who has all the Tropes and Figures in Farnaby’s Rhetorick at his Finger’s Ends) to teach his Scholar to express himself handsomely in English, when it appears to be so little his Business or Thought, that the Boy’s Mother (despised, ’tis like, as illiterate for not having read a System of Logic or Rhetoric) outdoes him in it?  
  
“To speak and write correctly, gives a Grace, and gains a favourable Attention to what one has to say: And since ’tis English that an Englishman will have constant Use of, that is the Language he should chiefly cultivate, and wherein most Care should be taken to polish and perfect his Stile. To speak or write better Latin than English, may make a Man be talk’d of, but he will find it more to his Purpose to express himself well in his own Tongue, that he uses every Moment, than to have the vain Commendation of others for a very insignificant Quality. This I find universally neglected, nor no Care taken any where to improve young Men in their own Language, that they may thoroughly understand and be Masters of it. If any one among us have a Facility or Purity more than ordinary in his Mother Tongue, it is owing to Chance, or his Genius, or any Thing, rather than to his Education, or any Care of his Teacher. To mind what English his Pupil speaks or writes, is below the Dignity of one bred up among Greek and Latin, tho’ he have but little of them himself. These are the Learned Languages, fit only for Learned Men to meddle with and teach: English is the Language of the illiterate Vulgar. Though the Great Men among the Romans were daily exercising themselves in their own Language; and we find yet upon Record the Names of Orators who taught some of their Emperors Latin, tho’ it were their Mother Tongue. ’Tis plain the Greeks were yet more nice in theirs. All other Speech was barbarous to them but their own, and no foreign Language appears to have been studied or valued amongst that learned and acute People; tho’ it be past Doubt, that they borrowed their Learning and Philosophy from abroad.  
  
“I am not here speaking against Greek and Latin. I think Latin at least ought to be well understood by every Gentleman. But whatever foreign Languages a young Man meddles with, that which he should critically study, and labour to get a Facility, Clearness and Elegancy to express himself in, should be his own; and to this purpose he should daily be Exercised in it.”  
  
To the same Purpose

The first of these recommends it to the Study of grown Men, the latter makes me think it the fittest for a young Lad, who as soon as he is instructed in Chronology, and acquainted with the several Epochas in Use in this Part of the World, and can reduce them to the Julian Period, should then have some History put into his Hand. Educ. p. 276.  
  
Mons. Rollin complains, that the College Education in France is defective in Teaching History; which he thinks may be made of great Advantage to Youth. This he demonstrates largely in his Belles Lettres, to the Satisfaction of all that read the Book. He lays down the following Rules for Studying History, viz. 1. To reduce the Study to Order and Method. 2. To observe what relates to Usages and Customs. 3. To enquire particularly, and above all Things, after the Truth. 4. To endeavour to find out the Causes of the Rise and Fall of States, of the Gaining or Losing of Battles, and other Events of Importance. 5. To study the Character of the Nations and great Men mentioned in History. 6. To be attentive to such Instructions as concern Moral Excellency and the Conduct of Life. 7. Carefully to note every Thing that relates to Religion. Vol. 3. p. 146.

 them, and point out their Fitness or Necessity, naturally lead one, as it were by the Hand, to take Notice of them. One who is persuaded and moved by a Speech, and heartily admires its Force and Beauty, will with Pleasure enter into a critical Examination of its Excellencies; and willingly lay up in his Mind the Rules of Rhetoric such an Example of Eloquence plainly suggests.

History will also give Occasion to expatiate on the Advantage of Civil Orders and Constitutions, how Men and their Properties are protected by joining in Societies and establishing Government; their Industry encouraged and rewarded, Arts invented, and Life made more comfortable: The Advantages of Liberty, Mischiefs of Licentiousness, Benefits arising from good Laws and a due Execution of Justice, &amp;c.

‡“After this, they are to dive into the Grounds of Law and legal Justice; deliver’d first and with best Warrant by Moses; and as far as human Prudence can be trusted, in those celebrated Remains of the antient Grecian and Roman Lawgivers, &amp;c.” [Milton,] p. 382.  
  
“When he has pretty well digested Tully’s Offices, says Mr. Locke, p. 277. and added to it Puffendorff de Officio Hominis &amp; Civis, it may be seasonable to set him upon Grotius, de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, or which perhaps is the better of the two, Puffendorff de Jure naturali [naturae] &amp; Gentium; wherein he will be instructed in the natural Rights of Men, and the Original and Foundations of Society, and the Duties resulting from thence. This general Part of Civil Law and History are Studies which a Gentleman should not barely touch at, but constantly dwell upon, and never have done with. A virtuous and well-behaved young Man, that is well versed in the general Part of the Civil Law (which concerns not the Chicane of private Cases, but the Affairs and Intercourse of civilized Nations in general, grounded upon Principles of Reason) understands Latin well, and can write a good Hand, one may turn loose into the World, with great Assurance that he will find Employment and Esteem every where.”

When Youth are told, that the Great Men whose Lives and Actions they read in History, spoke two of the best Languages that ever were, the most expressive, copious, beautiful; and that the finest Writings, the most correct Compositions, the most perfect Productions of human Wit and Wisdom, are in those Languages, which have endured Ages, and will endure while there are Men; that no Translation can do them Justice, or give the Pleasure found in Reading the Originals; that those Languages contain all Science; that one of them is become almost universal, being the Language of Learned Men in all Countries; that to understand them is a distinguishing Ornament, &amp;c. they may be thereby made desirous of learning those Languages, and their Industry sharpen’d in the Acquisition of them. All intended for Divinity should be taught the Latin and Greek; for Physick, the Latin, Greek and French; for Law, the Latin and French; Merchants, the French, German, and Spanish: And though all should not be compell’d to learn Latin, Greek, or the modern foreign Languages; yet none that have an ardent Desire to learn them should be refused; their English, Arithmetick, and other Studies absolutely necessary, being at the same Time not neglected.

hilosophy, says, “That much of it falls within the Capacity of all Sorts of Persons, even of Children. It consists in attending to the Objects with which Nature presents us, in considering them with Care, and admiring their different Beauties, &amp;c.

“I say that even Children are capable of Studying Nature, for they have Eyes, and don’t want Curiosity; they ask Questions, and love to be informed; and here we need only awaken and keep up in them the Desire of Learning and Knowing, which is natural to all Mankind. Besides this Study, if it is to be called a Study, instead of being painful and tedious, is pleasant and agreeable; it may be used as a Recreation, and should usually be made a Diversion. It is inconceivable, how many Things Children are capable of, if all the Opportunities of Instructing them were laid hold of, with which they themselves supply us.  
  
“A Garden, a Country, a Plantation, are all so many Books which lie open to them; but they must have been taught and accustomed to read in them. Nothing is more common amongst us than the Use of Bread and Linnen. How seldom do Children know how either of them are prepared, through how many Operations and Hands the Corn and Flax must pass, before they are turned into Bread and Linnen? The same may be said of Cloth, which bears no Resemblance to the Wool whereof it is formed, any more than Paper to the Rags which are picked up in the Streets: And why should not Children be instructed in these wonderful Works of Nature and Art which they every Day make Use of without reflecting upon them

“a careful Master may in this Way enrich the Mind of his Disciple with a great Number of useful and agreeable Ideas, and by a proper Mixture of short Reflections, will at the same Time take Care to form his Heart, and lead him by Nature to Religion.”  
  
Milton also recommends the Study of Natural Philosophy to Youth, Educ. p. 380. “In this,” says he, “they may proceed leisurely from the History of Meteors, Minerals, Plants and living Creatures, as far as Anatomy; Then also in Course might be read to them out of some not tedious Writer, the Institution of Physick; that they may know the Tempers, the Humours, the Seasons, and how to manage a Crudity; which he who can wisely and timely do, is not only a great Physician to himself, and to his Friends, but also may at some Time or other save an Army by this frugal and expenseless Means only; and not let the healthy and stout Bodies of young Men rot away under him for want of this Discipline, which is a great Pity, and no less a Shame to the Commander.”

And here will be an Occasion of inciting and enabling them hereafter to improve the Tillage of their Country, to recover the bad Soil, and to remedy the Waste that is made of Good; for this was one of Hercules’ Praises.” Educ. p. 379.  
  
Hutcheson [i.e., Fordyce] (Dialogues on Educ. 303, 2d Vol.) says, “Nor should I think it below the Dignity or Regard of an University, to descend even to the general Precepts of Agriculture and Gardening. Virgil, Varro, and others eminent in Learning, tho’t it not below their Pen——and why should we think meanly of that Art, which was the Mother of Heroes,

Courage, says an excellent Writer, in an ill-bred Man has the Air, and escapes not the Opinion of Brutality; Learning becomes Pedantry; Wit, Buffoonery; Plainness, Rusticity; and there cannot be a good Quality in him which Ill-breeding will not warp and disfigure to his Disadvantage.” Tur

The Idea of what is true Merit, should also be often presented to Youth, explain’d and impress’d on their Minds, as consisting in an Inclination join’d with an Ability to serve Mankind, one’s Country, Friends and Family; which Ability is (with the Blessing of God) to be acquir’d or greatly encreas’d by true Learning; and should indeed be the great Aim and End  
  
†To have in View the Glory and Service of God, as some express themselves, is only the same Thing in other Words. For Doing Good to Men is the only Service of God in our Power; and to imitate his Beneficence is to glorify him. Hence Milton says, “The End of Learning is to repair the Ruins of our first Parents, by regaining to know God aright, and out of that Knowledge to love him, to imitate him, to be like him, as we may the nearest by possessing our Souls of true Virtue.” Educ. p. 373. Mr. Hutcheson [i.e., Fordyce] says, Dial. V. 2. p. 97. “The principal End of Education is, to form us wise and good Creatures, useful to others and happy ourselves. The whole Art of Education lies within a narrow Compass, and is reducible to a very simple Practice; namely, To assist in unfolding those Natural and Moral Powers with which Man is endowed, by presenting proper Objects and Occasions; to watch their Growth that they be not diverted from their End, or disturbed in their Operation by any foreign Violence; and gently to conduct and apply them to all the Purposes of private and of public Life.” And Mr. Locke (p. 84. Educ.) says, “’Tis Virtue, then, direct Virtue, which is to be aim’d at in Education. All other Considerations and Accomplishments are nothing in Comparison to this. This is the solid and substantial Good, which Tutors should not only read Lectures and talk of, but the Labour and Art of Education should furnish the Mind with, and fasten there, and never cease till the young Man had a true Relish of it, and plac’d his Strength, his Glory, and his Pleasure, in it.” And Mons. Rollin, Belles Lettres, Vol. 4. p. 249. to the same Purpose, “If we consult our Reason ever so little, it is easy to discern that the End which Mas

‘To write and speak correctly, gives a grace, and gains a fa-  
vorable attention to what one has to say: and since it is English  
that an English gentleman will have constant use of, that is the  
language he should chiefly cultivate, and wherein most care  
should be taken to polish and perfect his style. To speak or  
write better Latin than English, may make a man be talked of, but  
he will find it more to his purpose, to express himself well in  
his own tongue, that he uses every moment, than to have the  
vain commendation of others for a very insignificant quality.  
This I find universally neglected, nor no care taken any where  
to improve young men in their own language, that they may  
thoroughly understand and be masters of it. If any one among  
us have a facility or purity more than ordinary in his mother  
tongue, it is owing to chance, or his genius, or any thing, rather  
than his education, or any -care of his teacher. ‘To mind what  
English his pupil speaks or writes, is below the dignity of one  
bred up amongst Greek and Latin, though he have but little of  
them himself. These are the learned languages fit only for  
learned mento meddle with and teach; English is the language  
of illiterate vulgar: though yet we see the polity of some of our  
neighbors hath not thought it beneath the public care to promote  
and reward the improvement of their own language. Polishing  
and enriching their tongue is no small business amongst them; it  
hath colleges and stipends appointed it, and there is raised  
amongst them a great ambition and emulation of writing correct-  
ly: and we see what they are come to by it, and how far they  
have spread one of the worst languages possibly in this part of  
the world, if we look upon it as it was in some few reigns back

wards, whatever it be now. The great men among the Romans  
were daily exercising themselves in their own language; and  
we find yet upon record, the names of orators, who taught some  
of their emperors Latin, though it were their mother tongue.  
  
Tis plain the Greeks were yet more nice in theirs; all other  
speech was barbarous to them but their own, and no foreign  
language appears to have been studied or valued amongst that  
learned and acute people; though it be past doubt that they bor-  
rowed their learning and philosophy from abroad.  
  
I am not here speaking against Greek and Latin; I think they  
ought to be studied, and the Latin at least understood well by  
every gentleman. But whatever foreign languages a young  
man meddles with (and the more he knows the better) that which  
he should critically study, and labor to get a facility, clearness,  
and elegancy to express himself in, should be his own, and to  
this purpose he should daily be exercised in it.’  
  
In another place he says, ‘ There can scarce be a greater de-  
fect in a gentleman, than not to express himself well either  
in writing or speaking. But yet I think, I may ask my reader,  
whether he doth not know a great many, who live upon their  
estates, and so, with the name, should have the qualities of  
gentlemen, who cannot so much as tell a story as they should,  
much less speak clearly, and persuasively in any business.  
This I think not to be so much their fault as the fault of their  
education; for I must without partiality do my countrymen this  
right, that where they apply themselves, I see none of their  
neighbors outgo them. They have been taught rhetoric, but  
yet never taught how to express themselyes handsomely with

2, Others there are, the greatest part of whose business in  
this world is to be done with their tongues and with their pens;  
and to those it is convenient, if not necessary, that they should  
speak properly and correctly, whereby they may let their thoughts  
into other men’s minds the more easily and with the greater  
impression. Upon this account it isythat any sort of speaking,  
so as will make him be understood, is not thought enough for  
a gentleman. He ought to study grammar amongst the other  
helps of speaking well; but it must be the grammar of his own  
tongue, of the language he uses, that he may understand his  
own country speech nicely, and speak it properly, without shock-  
ing the ears of those it is addressed to, with solecisms and offen-  
sive irregularities. And to this purpose grammar is necessary:  
but itis the grammar only of their own proper tongues, and to  
those only who would take pains in cultivating their language, and  
in perfecting their styles.. Whether all gentlemen should not do  
this, I leave to be considered, since the want of propriety and  
grammatical exactness, is thought very misbecoming one of  
that rank and usually draws on one guilty of such faults the  
eensure of having had a lower breeding and worse company than  
suits with his quality. If this be so, (asI suppose it is) it will  
be matter of wonder why young gentlemen are forced to learn  
the grammars of foreign and dead languages, and are never  
once told of the grammar of their own tongues: they do not so  
much as know there is any such thing, much less is it made their  
business to be instructed in it. Nor is their own language ever  
proposed to them as worthy their care and cultivating, though

comes to propose to himself the study of any thing that shall re-  
quire it; which brings me to the other part of the inquiry, viz.  
When grammar should be taught? To which, upon the premised  
grounds, the answer is obvious, viz.  
  
That if grammar ought to be taught any time, it must be to  
one that can speak the language already: how else can he be  
taught the grammar of it? This at least is evident from the  
practice of the wise and learned nations amongst the ancients.  
They made it a part of education to cultivate their own,  
not foreign tongues. The Greeks counted all other nations  
barbarous, and had a contempt for theirlanguages. And though  
the Greek learning grew im credit amongst the Romans, towards  
the end of their commonwealth, yet it was the Roman tongue  
that was made the study of their youth: their own language they  
were to make use of, and therefore it was their own language

‘The study of nature scarcely requires any thing but eye-sight,  
and is therefore adapted to every capacity and even to children.  
It consists in attending to the objects presented to us by nature,  
in contemplating them with attention, and admiring their various  
beauties; but without searching out their causes, which properly  
belongs to the science called Physics.  
  
The study of natural history (if it can be called a study) in-  
stead of being tedious and irksome is pleasant and agreeable;  
it may be used as a recreation, and should generally be made  
a diversion. It is inconceivable how many things children are  
capable of learning, did we improve every opportunity of in-  
structing them with which they themselves furnish us. &lt;A _ gar-  
den, a field, a house, may be considered as so many books lying  
open before them ; but they must be taught and accustomed  
to read them. Nothing is more common than bread and  
linen, yet how few children know how either of them are _pre-  
pared, or through how many hands corn and flax must pass be-

time,” says our own Locke, “ it must be to one that can eek

“ But, more particularly, to determine the proper season for  
grammar, I do not see how it can reasonably be made any one’s  
study, but as an introduction to rhetoric. When it is thought  
time to put any one upon the care of polishing his tongue, and  
of speaking better than the illiterate, then is the time for him

ference to which all things, great and small, are to be  
planned and conducted, we cannot for an instant lose  
sight of the life and immortality brought to light in the Gos-  
pel. “ The end of learning,” says Milton, “is to repair the  
ruins of our first parents by regaining to know God aright,

faith, makes up the highest perfection.” And we believe the

at once fallen, and capable of restoration.

besides the eyes, and for this reason, falls within the capacity of  
all sorts of persons, and even of children. It consists in attend-  
ing to the objects with which nature presents us, — in consid-  
ering them with care, and admiring their different beauties, but  
without searching out their secret causes, which properly belong  
to the physicks of the learned.  
  
I say, that even children are capable of it, for they have  
eyes and don’t want curiosity; they ask questions and love to  
be informed ; and here we need only awaken and keep up in  
them the desire of learning and knowing, which is natural to all  
mankind. Besides, this study, if it is to be called a study,  
instead of being painful and tedious, is pleasant and agreeable ;  
it may be used as a recreation, and should usually be made a  
diversion. It is inconceivable how many things children are  
capable of, if all the opportunities of instructing them were laid  
hold of which they themselves supply us.  
  
A garden, a country, a palace, are all so many books which  
lie open to them; but they must have been taught and accus-  
tomed to read in them. Nothing is more common amongst us  
than the use of bread and linen. How seldom do children  
know how either of them are prepared,—through how many  
operations and hands the corn and the flax must pass before  
they are turned into bread and linen. The same may be said  
of cloth, which bears no resemblance to the wool whereof it is  
formed, any more than paper to the rags which are picked up

committed to words, are in danger to be lost, or at best but ill retained in the  
most exact descriptions? Ido not mean that I would have your son a perfect

gentleman can spare from his other improvements of greater moment; but so

2. Others there are, the greatest part of whose business in this world is to be  
done with their tongues, and with their pens; and to those it is convenient, if  
not necessary, that they should speak properly and correctly, whereby they  
may let their thoughts into other men’s minds the more easily, and with the  
greater impression. Upon this account it is, that any sort of speaking, so as  
will make him be understood, is not thought enough for a gentleman. He  
ought to study grammar, amongst the other helps of speaking well; but it must  
be the grammar of his own tongue, of the language he uses, that he may under-  
stand his own country speech nicely, and speak it properly, without shocking  
the ears of those it is addressed to with solecisms and offensive irregularities.  
And to this purpose grammar is necessary; but it is the grammar only of their  
Own proper tongues, and to those only who would take pains in cultivating  
their language, and in perfecting their styles. Whether all gentlemen should  
not do this, I leave to be considered, since the want of propriety, and gram-  
matical exactness, is thought very mis-becoming one of that rank, and usually  
draws on one guilty of such faults the censure of having had a lower breeding,  
and worse company than suits with his quality. If this be so, (as I suppose it

is,) it will be matter of wonder, why young gentlemen are forced to learn the  
grammars of foreign and dead languages, and are never once told of the gram-  
mar of their own tongues: they do not so much as know there is any such  
thing, much less is it made their business to be instructed in it. Nor is their  
own language ever proposed to them as worthy their care and cultivating,  
though they have daily use of it, and are not seldom in the future course of  
their lives judged of, by their handsome or awkward way of expressing them-  
selves in it. Whereas the languages whose grammars they have_been so much  
employed in, are such as probably they shall scarce ever speak or write; or, if  
upon occasion this should happen, they shall be excused for the mistakes and  
faults they make in it. Would not a Chinese, who took notice of this way of  
breeding, be apt to imagine, that all our young gentlemen were designed to be  
teachers and professors of the dead languages of foreign countries, and not to  
be men of business in their own

 out of the  
Roman and Greek writers, I think he may attain without studying the gram-  
mars of those tongues, and, by bare reading, may come to understand them  
sufficiently for all his purposes. How much farther he shall at any time be  
concerned to look into the grammar and critical niceties of either of these  
tongues, he himself will be ablé to determine, when he comes to propose to  
himself the study of any thing that shall require it. Which brings me to the  
other part of the inquiry, viz.:—  
  
“When grammar should be taught?”  
  
To which, upon the premised grounds, the answer is obvious, viz. :—  
  
That if grammar ought to be taught at any time, it must be to one that can  
speak the language already: -how else can he be taught the grammar of it?  
This, at least, is evident from the practice of the wise and learned nations  
amongst the ancients. They made it a part of education to cultivate their own,  
not foreign tongues. The Greeks counted all other nations barbarous, and had  
a contempt for their languages. And, though the Greek learning grew in credit  
amongst the Romans, towards the end of their commonwealth, yet it was the  
Roman tongue that was made the study of their youth: their own language  
they were to make use of, and therefore it was their own language they were  
instructed and exercised in.  
  
But more particularly to determine the proper season for grammar; I do not  
see how it can reasonably be made any one’s study, but as an introduction to  
rhetoric: when it is thought time to put any one upon the care of polishing his  
tongue, and of speaking better than the illiterate, then is the time for him to be  
instructed in the rules of grammar, and not before. For grammar being to  
teach men not to speak, but to speak correctly, and according to the exact rules  
of the tongue, which is one part of elegancy, there is little use of the one t

178. As nothing teaches, so nothing delights, more than history. The first  
of these recommends it to the study of grown men; the latter makes me think  
it the fittest for a young lad, who, as soon as he is instructed in chronology, and  
acquainted with the several epochs, in use in this part of the world, and can  
reduce them to the Julian period, should then have some Latin history put into

wherever he begins, chronology will keep it from confusion; and the pleasant-  
ness of the subject inviting him to read, the language will insensibly be got,  
without that terrible vexation and uneasiness which children suffer where they

which a gentleman should not barely touch at, but constantly dwell upon, and  
never have done with. A virtuous and well-behaved young man, that is well

disputing. Truth is to be found and supported by a mature and due considera-  
tion of things themselves, and not by artificial terms and ways of arguing:  
these lead not men so much into the discovery of truth, as into a captious and  
fallacious use of doubtful words, which is the most useless and most offensive  
way of talking, and such as least suits a gentleman or a lover of truth of any  
thing in the world.  
  
There can scarce be a greater defect in a gentleman, than not to express him-  
self well, either in writing or speaking. But yet, I think, I may ask my reader,  
whether he doth not know a great many, who live upon their estates, and so,  
with the name, should have the qualities of gentlemen, who can not so much  
as tell a story as they should, much less speak clearly and persuasively in any  
business? This I think not to be so much their fault, as the fault of their edu-  
cation; for I must, without partiality, do my countrymen this right, that where  
they apply themselves, I see none of their neighbors outgo them. They have  
been taught rhetoric, but yet never taught how to express themselves hand

tern, whether for business or conversation. The writing of letters has so much  
to do in all the occurrences of human life, that no gentleman can avoid showing  
himself in this kind of writing: occasions will daily force him to make this use  
of his pen, which, besides the consequences, that, in his affairs, his well or ill  
managing of it often draws after it, always lays him open to a severer examina-  
tion of his breeding, sense, and abilities, than oral discourses; whose transient  
faults, dying for the most part with the sound that gives them life, and so not  
subject to a strict review, more easily escape observation and censure.  
  
ENGLISH.  
  
Had the methods of education been directed to their right end, one would  
have thought this so necessary a part, could not have been neglected, whilst  
themes and verses in Latin, of no use at all, were, so constantly every where  
pressed, to the racking of children’s inventions beyond their strength, and hin-  
dering their cheerful progress in learning the tongues, by unnatural difficulties.  
But custom has so ordained it, and who dares disobey? And would it not be  
very unreasonable to require of a learned country schoolmaster (who has all the  
tropes and figures in Farnaby’s rhetoric at his fingers’ ends,) to teach his scholar  
to express hifnself handsomely in English, when it appears to be so little his  
business or thought, that the boy’s mother (despised, it is like, as illiterate, for  
not having read a system of logic and rhetoric,) outdoes him in it?  
  
To write and speak correctly, gives a grace, and.gains a favorable attention  
to what one has to say; and, since it is English that an English gentleman will  
have constant use of, that is the language he should chiefly cultivate, and  
wherein most care should be taken to polish and perfect his style. To speak  
or write better Latin than English, may make a man be talked of; but he would  
find it more to his purpose to express himself well in his own tongue, that he  
uses every moment, than to have the vain commendation of others for a very

insignificant quality. This I find universally neglected, and no care taken any  
where to improve young men in their own language, that they may thoroughly  
understand and be masters of it. If any one among us have a facility or pu-  
rity more than ordinary in his mother tongue, it is owing to chance, or his  
genius, or any thing, rather than to his education, or any care of his teacher.  
To mind what English his pupil speaks or writes, is below the dignity of one  
bred up amongst Greek and Latin, though he have but little of them himself.  
These are the learned languages, fit only for learned men to meddle with and  
teach; English is the language of the illiterate vulgar; though yet we see the  
policy of some of our neighbors hath not thought it beneath the public care to  
promote and reward the improvement of their own language. Polishing and  
enriching their tongue, is no small business amongst them; it hath colleges and  
stipends appointed it, and there is raised amongst them a great ambition and  
emulation of writmg correctly; and we see what they are come to by it, and  
how far they have spread one of the worst languages, possibly in this part of

selves in their own language; and we find yet upon record the names of ora  
tors, who taught some of their emperors Latin, though it were their mother

It is plain the Greeks were yet more nice in theirs; all other speech was bar-

studied or valued amongst that learned and acute people; though it be past  
doubt, that they borrowed their learning and philosophy from abroad.

MERCHANTS’ ACCOUNTS. ,  
  
Merchants’ accounts, though a science not likely to help a gentleman to get  
an estate, yet possibly there is not any thing of more use and efficacy to make  
nim preserve the estate he has. It is seldom observed, that he who keeps an  
account of his income and expenses, and thereby has constantly under view the  
course of his domestic affairs, lets them run to ruin; and I doubt not but many  
a man gets behind-hand before he is aware, or runs further on, when he is once

When he can write well and quick, I think it may

Value of a Knowledge of the Grammar of the  
Mother Tongue.  
  
2. Others there are, the greatest part of whose  
business in this world is to be done with their tongues  
and with their pens; and to those it is convenient, if  
not necessary, that they should ‘speak properly and  
correctly, whereby they may let their thoughts into  
other men’s minds the more easily, and with the  
greater impression. Upon this account it is, that any  
sort of speaking, so as will make him to be under-  
stood, is not thought enough fora gentleman. He  
ought to study grammar amongst the other he!ps of  
speaking well, but it must be the grammar of his own  
tongue, of the language he uses, that he may under-  
stand his own country speech nicely, and speak it pro-  
perly, without shocking the ears of those it is addressed  
to, with solecisms and offensive irregularities. And  
to this purpose grammar is necessary: but it is the  
grammar only of their own proper tongues, and to  
those only who would take pains in cultivating their  
language, and in perfecting their styles. Whether all  
gentlemen should not do this, I leave to be con-  
sidered, since the want of propriety and grammatical  
exactness, is thought very misbecoming one of that  
rank, and usually draws on one guilty of such faults  
the censure of having had a lower breeding and worse  
company than suits with his quality. If this be so,  
(as I suppose it is) it will be matter of wonder why  
young gentlemen are forced to learn the grammars of  
foreign and dead languages, and are never once told  
of the grammar of their own tongues: they do not so  
much as know there is any such thing, much less is it  
made their business to be instructed in it. Nor is  
their own language ever proposed to them as worthy  
their care and cultivating, though they have daily use  
of it, and are not seldom, in the future course of their  
lives, judged of by their handsome or awkward way of  
expressing themselves in it. Whereas the language  
whose grammars they have been so much employed  
in, are such as probably they shall scarce ever speak  
or write ; or if, upon occasion, this should happen,  
they shall be excused for the mistakes and faults they  
make in it. Would not a Chinese, who took notice  
of this way of breeding, be apt to imagine, that all  
our young gentlemen were designed to be teachers  
and professors of the dead languages of foreign  
countries, and not to be men of business in their  
own

when he comes to propose to himself the study of  
anything that shall require it. Which brings me to  
the other part of the inquiry, viz—  
  
‘When Grammar should be Taught?’  
  
To which, upon the premised grounds, the answer  
is obvious, viz—  
  
That if grammar ought to be taught at any time, it  
must be to one that can speak the language already;  
how else can he be taught the grammar of it? This,  
at least, is evident from the practice of the wise and  
learned nations amongst the ancients, They made it  
a part of education to cultivate their own, not foreign  
tongues. The Greeks counted all other nations bar-  
barous, and had a contempt for their languages. And,  
though the Greek learning grew in credit amongst the  
Romans, towards the end of their commonwealth, yet  
it was the Roman tongue that was made the study of  
their youth; their own language they were to make  
use of, and therefore it was their own language they  
were instructed and exercised in,  
  
But, more particularly to determine the proper  
season for grammar, I do not see how it can reason-  
ably be made anyone’s study, but as an introduction  
to rhetoric: when it is thought time to put anyone  
upon the care of polishing his tongue, and of speak-  
ing better than the illiterate ; then is the time for him  
to be instructed in the rules of grammar, and not  
before. For grammar being to teach men not to  
speak, but to speak correctly, and according to the  
exact rules of the tongue, which is one part of  
elegancy, there is little use of the one to him that ha

e of an education in connection with things  
rests, however, not so much in the amount of  
information obtained as in the training which  
such education affords. Knowledge thus gained  
is full and exact as, ¢g., when the study of  
Geology is pursued mainly by an examination of  
typical hand specimens, and by the microscopical  
inspection of thin sections of rock, in order to  
determine their crystalline structure, and when  
also the arrangement of the strata is viewed  
during series of Geological excursions. How  
rich and full is the knowledge thus gained by the  
side of that acquired by reading alone. ]  
  
There can scarce be a greater defect in a gentleman,  
than not to express himself well, either in writing or  
speaking. But yet, I think, 1 may ask my reader,  
whether he dues not know a great many, who live  
upon their estates, and so, with the name, should have  
the qualities of gentlemen, who’cannot so much as tell  
astory as they should, much less speak clearly and  
persuasively in any business. This I think not to be

Had the methods of education been directed to  
their right end, one would have thought this, so  
necessary a part, could not have been neglected ;  
whilst themes and verses in Latin, of no use at all,  
were so constantly everywhere pressed, to the racking

hindering their cheerful progress in learning the  
tongues by unnatural difficulties. But custom has so

not be very unreasonable to require of a learned

teach his scholar to express himself handsomely in  
English when it appears to be so little his business or

ne that would be  
informed in the principles, and precepts of virtue, for  
the conduct of his life.  
  
[Right action stimulated by the example of  
those surrounding the pupil, and rendered habitual  
by frequent practice, is enjoined by Locke as being  
of more worth than the conduct which is regu-  
lated by rules dogmatically taught and which is  
fostered by the mere love of reputation. In  
school discipline it is necessary to bear in mind  
that the higher motives to right action can only  
be appealed to in the later school-days. Cicero’s  
De Officiis is a study in moral conduct. ]  
  
Civil rule and history.  
  
When he has pretty well digested Tully’s Offices,  
and added to it Puffendorf de officio hominis et civis,  
it may be seasonable to set him upon Grotius de jure  
belli et pacis, or, which perhaps is the better of the two,  
Puffendorf de jure naturali et gentium, wherein he will  
be instructed in the natural rights of men, and the  
original and foundations of society, and the duties  
resulting from thence. This general part of civil law  
and history, are studies which a gentleman should not  
barely touch at, but constantly dwell upon, and never  
have done with. A virtuous and well-behaved young  
man, that is well versed in the general part of the civil  
law (which concerns not the chicane of private cases,  
but the affairs and intercourse of civilized nations in  
general, grounded upon principles of reason) under-  
stands Latin well, and can write a good hand, one may  
turn loose into the world, with great assurance that he  
will find employment and esteem everywhere
