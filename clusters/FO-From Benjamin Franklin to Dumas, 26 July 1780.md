I wrote to Mrs: De Neuville by the last Post in answer to theirs of the 14th. I hope they received my Letter. It signified that I would accept the Bills drawn on M. Laurens. I find by a Vote of Congress on the 4th of March, that they then stopt drawing, and I am informed no more Bills have been issued since. I could not relish those Gentlemen’s Proposal of Mortaging all our Estates for the little Money Holland is likely to lend us. But I am obliged to them for their Zeal in our Cause.  
I received and thank you for the Protest relating to the Election of the Coadjutor.  
You seem to be too much affected with the taking of Charlestown. It is so far a Damage to us as it will enable the Enemy to exchange a great Part of the Prisoners we had in our hands, otherwise their Affairs will not be much advanced by it. They have successively been in Possession of the Capitals of 5 Provinces, viz. Massachusetts Bay, Rhode island, Pennsylvania, New York and Georgia; but were not therefore in Possession of the Provinces themselves. New-York and Georgia still continue their Operations as free States; and so I Suppose will S. Carolina. The Cannon will be recover’d with the Place; if not, our furnaces are constantly at work in making more. The Destroying of our Ships by the English is only like shaving our Beards, which will grow again. Their Loss of Provinces is like the Loss of Limbs which can never again be united to their Body.  
I was sorry to hear of your Indisposition. Take care of yourself. Honey is a good thing for Obstructions in the veins. I hope your Health is by this Time re-established.  
I am less committed than you imagine in the affair between Jones &amp; Landais. The latter was not dispossessed by me of his Command, but quitted it. He afterwards took into his head to resume it, which the former’s too long stay at Paris gave him an Opportunity of effecting. Capt. Jones is going in the Ariel frigate to America, where they may Settle their Affairs as they can.  
The Capt. Cornu of Dunkerque, who occasioned the Loss of our Dispatches, is himself taken by the English.— I have no doubt of the Truth of what Mr. White told you about the facility with which the Tax was collected.—  
  
That same Baron de Wulffen has not pleased me, having left little Debts behind him unpaid, tho’ I furnished him with 20 Guineas. As he had been with his Brother at Venlo before he saw you where he might get Money. I wonder at his borrowing of you.  
I thank you for the Vote of Congress you send me dated the 23d March.— I imagine 484 went in that Vessel to 533, and may have been detained there for Convoy.  
Your Dispatches by M. Gillon are in the Alliance, which sailed the 7th. or 9th. Instant.  
This will be delivered to you by his Excellency John Adams Esqr. whom I earnestly recommend to your best Civilities. He has never been in Holland and your Counsels will be of use to him.  
My best Wishes attend you, being ever Dear Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servt.

Passy, Fuly 28, 1780.  
Dear Sir,  
  
I wrote to Messrs. De Neufville by the last  
post in answer to theirs of the 14th, I hope they  
received my letter, it signified that I could ac-  
cept the bills,drawn on Mr. Laurens. I find by  
a note of Congress on the 4th of March, that  
they then stopt drawing, and I am informed no  
more bills have been issued since. I could noi  
relish those gentleman’s proposals of mortgaging  
all our estates, for the littke money Holland is  
likely tolend us. But I am obliged to them for  
their zeal in our cause.  
  
I received and thank you for the protest re-  
lating to the election of the coadjutor. You seem  
to be too much affected with the taking of  
Charleston. It is so far a damage to us, as it  
will enable the enemy to exchange a great part  
of the prisoners we had in our hands, otherwise  
their affairs will not be much advanced by it.  
They have successively been in possession of the  
capitals of five provinces, viz» Massachusetts  
bay, Rhode-Island, Pennsyivania, New-York, and  
Georgia; but were not therefore in possession  
of the provinces themselves. New-York and  
Georgia still continue their operations as free  
states, and so I suppose will S. Carolina. The  
cannon will be recovered with the place ; if not,  
our furnaces are constantly at wok in making  
more. The destroying of our ships by the Eng-  
lish, is only like shaving our beards which will  
grow again. ‘Their loss. of provinces, is like the  
loss of limb, can never again be united to their  
body. I was sorry to hear of your indisposition.  
Take care of yourself. Honey is a good thing

by the English. I have no doubt of the truth of  
what Mr. White told you about the facility with  
  
  
  
| which the tax was collected.  
  
That same Baron de Wulffen has not pleased  
me, having left little debts behind him unpaid,  
though I furnished him with twenty guineas.  
As he had been with his brother at Verlo, before  
he saw you, where he might get money, I won-  
der at his borrowing of you.  
  
I thank y.ou for the vote of Congress you send  
me, dated the 23d ef March. I imagine 484,  
went in that vessel to 535, and may have been de-  
tained there for convoy.  
  
Your dispatches hy M. Gillon, are in the Alli-  
ance, which sailed the 7th or 9th instant.  
  
This will be delivered to you by his Excellency  
John Adams Esqr. whom I earnestly recom-  
mend to your best civilities. He has never been  
in Holland, and your counsels will be of use to  
him.  
  
My best wishes attend you, being  
ever, dear Sir, your most obedient  
and most humble servant.  
B. FRANKLIN

ton, and the disasters of that period in both the  
Carolinas might well have cast a gloom of despon-  
dency over the prospects of the colonies and filled  
the best friends of the country with doubt and  
alarm. Franklin, however, was not of the num-  
ber of those fearful ones. Writing from Paris to  
to a friend in America he says, :  
  
* You seem to be too much affected with the loss  
of Charlestown. The enemy’s affairs will not be  
much advaneed by it. They have successively  
been in possession of the capitals of five provinces,  
but were not therefore in possession of the pro-  
vinces themselves. The cannon will be recovered  
with the place ; if not, our furnaces are constantly  
at work in making more. The destroying of our  
  
‘ships by the English is only like shaving our beards,  
  
which will grow again: their loss of provinces is  
like the loss of a limb, which can never again be  
united to their body.”
