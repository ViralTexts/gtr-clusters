Benja. Mecom writes me that he has remitted you Thirty Pounds Sterling which I am pleas’d to hear. And am glad you have not sent him the great Parcel of Books, &amp;c. which you mention he has wrote for. He is a young Lad, quite unacquainted with the World, and I fear would be much embarrass’d if he went suddenly into Dealings too deep for his Stock. The People of those Islands might buy his Books, but I know they are very dull Pay, and he would find it impracticable to collect the Money when it ought to be sent you. Pray keep him within Bounds, let him have good saleable Sortments, but small, and do not suffer him to be more than Fifty Pounds in your Debt, if so much. It is best for him to proceed gradually, and deal more as his Stock and Experience increases. I am thankful to you for prudently delaying to send what he so indiscretely wrote for, till you had advis’d me of it.
