Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along.  
Beautiful snow! it can do nothing wrong;  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek:  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel and fickle as love!  
  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one,  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by.  
It lights up the face and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around.  
The town is alive and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song;  
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by—  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye,  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go.  
Over the crest of the beautiful snow,  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;  
Fell, like the snow-flakes, from heaven—to hell!  
Fell, to be trampled as the filth of the street;  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow!  
  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face,  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters all,  
God and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh,  
For of all that is on or about me, I know,  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful snow.  
  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
How strange it would be, when the night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone!  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of this crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow coming down,  
To lie and to die in my terrible wo,  
With a bed and a shroud of beautiful snow!

&quot;ONCE I WAS PURE. 0 ! the snow, the  
beautiful snow, Filling the sky and  
earth below; Over the housetops, over  
the Street, Over the heads of the people  
you meet; Dancing, Flirting, Skimmering  
along, Beautiful snow ! it can do  
nothing wrong, Flying to kiss a fair  
lady&#x27;s cheek; Clinging to lips in a  
frolicksome freak ; Beautiful snow from  
the heavens above, Pure as an angel, and  
fickle as love! O ! the snow the  
beautiful snow ! How the flakes gather  
and laugh as they go! Whirling about in  
its maddening fun, It plays hi its glee  
with every one, Chasing, Laughing,  
Hurrying by, It lights up the-face, and  
it sparkles the eye ; And even the dogs,  
with a bark and a bound, Snap at the  
crystals that eddy around; The town is  
alive, and its heart in glow, To welcome  
the coming of the beautiful snow. How  
the wild crowd goes swazing along,  
Hailing each other with humour and song  
1 How the gay sledges, like meteors  
flash by, Bright for the moment, then  
lost to to the eye: Ringing, Swinging,  
Dashing they go Over the crust of the  
beautiful snow : Snow so pure when it  
falls from the sky, To be trampled in  
mud by the crowd rushing by; To be  
trampled and tracked by the thousand of  
feet, Till it blends with the horrible  
filth of the street. Once I was pure as  
the snow-but I fell Fell, like the snow  
flakes from Heaven to HellFell, to be  
trampled as filth in the streetFell, to  
be scoffed, to be spit on and beat J  
Pleading, Cursing, Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living, and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God ! have I fallen so low 1  
And yet I was once like this beautiful  
snow! Once I was fair as the beautiful  
snow, With an eye like its crystals, a  
heart like its glow Once I was loved for  
my innocent grace Flattered and sought  
for the charm of my face, Father,  
Mother, Sister, and all, God, and myself  
I have lost by my fall, The veriest  
wretch that goes shivering by Will take  
a wide sweep lest I wander to-nigh; For  
of all that is on or about me, I know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the  
beautiful snow. How strange it should be  
that this beautiful snow Should fall on  
a sinner with nowhere to go; How strange  
it would be when the night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my  
desperate brain Fainting, Freezing,  
Dying alone! Too wicked for prayer, too  
weak for my moan To be heard in the  
crash of the crazy town, Gone mad in  
their joy at the snow&#x27;s coming down To  
lie and to die in my terrible woe, With  
a bed and a shroud of the beautiful  
snow!

There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful snow.  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go !  
How strange it would be, when tho night comes  
again.  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone!  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow&#x27;s coming down ;  
To lie and to die in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow!

Flattered and sought for the charms of my face !

Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go I  
How strange it should be, when the night comes

The town is alive and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of the beautiful snow!  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its glow,  
Once I was loved for innocent grace  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face.  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters all,  
God and myself I have fost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shining by  
Will make a wide sweep lest I wander too nigh;  
For all that is on or above me, I know,  
There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautiful snow.  
How strange should it be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on the sinner, with nowhere to go.  
How strange it should be, when the night comes  
again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain.  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the street of the crazy town,  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down.  
To be, and so die, in my woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow.  
How wildly the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song.  
How the gay sledges, like meteors, flash by,  
Bright for the moment then lost to the eye  
Ringing, Swinging, Dancing they go,  
Over the course of the beautiful snow  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd passing by;  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow--but I fell!  
Fell like the snow-flakes from heaven to hell;  
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street;  
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,  
Pleading, Cursing, Dreading to die, A  
Selling my soul to whosoever would buy;  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God! have I lallen so low?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow

11EAUTIFUL SNOW. Oh &#x27; the snow, the  
beautiful snow, Filling the sky and the  
earth below ; Over tiie house tops, over  
the street, Over the heads of the people  
you meet, Dancing, flirting, skimming  
along ; Beautiful .snow ; it can do  
nothing wrong ; Flying to kiss a fair  
lady&#x27;s cheek, Glinging to lips in a  
frolicsome freak ; Beautiful snow from  
the heavens above, Pure as an angel,  
gentle as love 1 Oh 1 the snow, the  
beautiful snow, How the flakes gather  
and laugh as they go Whirling about in  
their maddening fan, It plays in its  
glee with everyone — Chasing, laughing,  
hurrying by, It lights on the face and  
be6parklcs the eye, And the dogs, with a  
bark and a bound, Snap at the crystals  
that eddy around — The town is alive and  
its- heart in a glow, To welcome the  
coming of beautiful suow. How widely the  
crowd goes swaying along, Hailing each  
other with humour and song 1 How the gay  
sledges like meteors flash by, Bright  
for a moment then lost to the eye !  
Hinging, swinging, dasliing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful soow —  
Snow so pure when it fiills from Uic  
sky, As- to nuike one regret to see it  
lie, To be trampled and tracked by the  
thousand* nf feet, Till it blends with  
the filth in the horrible street. Once I  
was pure as thfi snow ; but I fell, Fell  
like the snow flakes from heaven to  
hell) Fell to be trampled as filth in  
the street ; Fell to be scoffed, to be  
spit on and beat. Pleading, cursing,  
dreading to die, Selling my soul to  
whoever would buy ; Dealing in shame for  
a morsel of bread, Hating the living and  
fearing the dead. Merciful God ! Have I  
fallen so low ?— And yet I was once like

Fainting,

Dying alone,  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town.  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming

Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lip in a frolicsome freak.  
Beautiful snow from the Heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as love !  
Oh the snow, the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go  
Whirling about in the maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by ;

And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around :  
The town is alive, and it&#x27;s heart a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow !  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song,  
How the gay sledges, like meteors, ilash by,  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye ;  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go

Suow so (iure when it falls from the sky;  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands  
[of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible  
[street.  
Onee I was pure as the snow—but I fell,  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven to hell.  
Fell to be trampled as tilth 011 the street,  
Fell to be scoffed, {0 be spit 011 and beat ;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Haling the living and fearing the dead,  
Merciful God &#x27; have I fallen so low ?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow !  
Oneo I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its  
[glow ;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace,  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face!  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters, all,  
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall,  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by,  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh;  
For all that is on or above me ; I know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautiful  
[snow  
How strange it should be that this beautiful  
[snow  
Should fall ou a sinner with nowhere to go !  
How strange it should be, when the night  
(comes again.  
If the suow and the ice struck my desperate  
[brain ;  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked (&quot;or prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down,  
To lie, and to die in my terrible woe.

Over the heads of the people we meet,

Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong,  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,

To welcome the coming of beautiful snow!  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song!  
How the gay sleighs, like meteors, pass by.  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye­  
Ringing, swinging, dancing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow;  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,  
To be trampled and track&#x27;d by thousands of  
feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the terrible street.

It plays in its glee with everyone;  
Chasing—laughing—hurrying by,  
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye;.  
And the dogs with a bark and a bound  
Snap at the crystals as they eddy round;  
&#x27;The town is alive and its heart in a glow  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song;  
How the gay sleighs like meteors flash by,  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye;  
Ringing—swinging—dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow—  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd passing by,  
To be trampled and tracked by thousands oUfeet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow, but I fell,  
Fell like the snow—from heaven to hell;  
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street;  
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on nJ beat;  
Pleaduig—cursing—dreading to die,  
Selling my Snul to whoever would buy;  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread;  
Hating the living and fearing tho dead —  
Merciful God! Have 1 fallen so low!  
And yet 1 was once like tho beautiful snow,  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like »i crystal, a heart like its glow;.  
Once I was loved for my innocent, grace,  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face;  
Father—mother—sister—all,  
God and myself, I have lost by fall;  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will n.ake a wide sweep lest I wander too nigh;  
For all that is on or about me I know,  
There is nothing as nnor as the beautiful snow.  
flow strange it would be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere ta go!  
How strange it would be when the light comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain,  
If fainting—freezing—dying alone,  
Too wicked for a prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,  
(Gone mad in the joy of snow coming down),  
I should lie down and die in my teirible woe.  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow

Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over tlie housetops, over the street,  
over the heads of the people you meet. .  
, Dancing, flirting, skimming  
along—beautiful snow! it can do nothing  
wrong; Flying to kiss a fair lady s  
cheek, clinging to lips in frolicsome  
freak; Beautiful snow, from the heavens  
above—pure as an angel, gentle as love!  
Oh! the snow, tlie beautiful snow, liow

Whirling about in their maddening fun—it

Chasing, laughing, hurrying by, it  
lights on the face and sparkles tlie

in a glow, to wel come the coming of  
beautiful snow. How blithely the crowd  
goes swaying along, hail ing each other  
with humour and song. How i.ne gay  
siedges, like meteors, flash by, bright  
for a moment, then lost to the eye.  
Ringing, swinging, dashing they go, over  
the crust of the beautiful snow; Snow so  
pure, when it falls from the sky, as to  
make one regret to see it lie, To be  
trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet, till it blends with the filth iu  
the horrible street. Once I was pure as  
the snow, but I fell—fell, like the  
snowflakes. from heaven to hell; Fell,  
to be trampled as filth in the  
street—fell, to be scoffed, to be spit  
on, and heat; Pleading, cursing,  
dreading to die; selling my soul to  
whoever would buy; Dealing in shame for  
a morsel of bread; hating the living and  
fearing the dead. .Merciful God, have I  
fallen so low; and yet— 1 was once like  
the beautiful snow. Once I was fair as  
the beautiful snow, with an eye like ils

was loved for my innocent grace—flat

God and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering  
by will make a wide swoop lest 1 wander

the beautiful snow. How strange it  
should be that this beautiful snow
