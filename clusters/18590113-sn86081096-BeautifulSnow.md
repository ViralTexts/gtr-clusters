Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along.  
Beautiful snow! it can do nothing wrong;  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek:  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel and fickle as love!  
  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one,  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by.  
It lights up the face and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around.  
The town is alive and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song;  
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by—  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye,  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go.  
Over the crest of the beautiful snow,  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;  
Fell, like the snow-flakes, from heaven—to hell!  
Fell, to be trampled as the filth of the street;  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow!  
  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face,  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters all,  
God and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh,  
For of all that is on or about me, I know,  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful snow.  
  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
How strange it would be, when the night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone!  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of this crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow coming down,  
To lie and to die in my terrible wo,  
With a bed and a shroud of beautiful snow!

THE THANKSGIVING DINNER OF THE  
FIVE POINTS CHILDREN.  
  
WE engrave below one of the most interesting  
scenes of city life—the dinner which is given an-  
nually on Thanksgiving Day to the children of the  
Five Points by the Ladies’ Home Missionary So-  
ciety of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Many  
hundreds of our readers doubtless visited the build-  
ing and witnessed the happy feast of the little ones  
on Thursday last ; thousands who were not pres-  
ent read of the scene in the daily papers.  
  
Che Five Pofuts Mission was established some  
years since by some charitable ladies of New York,  
aided by their male acquaintances. A small build-

in school was held, and relief, food, clothing, and  
soap and water were freely offered to all poor chil-  
dren. The scheme was a bold one. At that time  
the Five Points were the nucleus of New York vice  
and crime. Pickpockets, burglars, prostitutes,  
murderers, and malefactors of every hue made the  
Five Points their head-quarters. They naturally  
regarded the refurmers with an evil eye. Menaces  
of vengeance against the disturbers of their peace  
were not wanting. Still the ladies who had start-  
ed the enterprise prosecuted it with unflagging  
courage, and month by month their sphere of use-  
fulness expanded. Even the very reprobates of  
the vicinity, finding that the ladies of the Mission  
sought nothing beyond the good of the children to  
whom they offered hospitality, forbore to insult  
them, and secretly wished them well. After a  
time it became obvious to the principal lady-man-  
ager, Mrs. Deuel, that the building occupied by  
the Mission was inadequate ; a more commodious  
edifice was essential to the fulfillment of the aim  
of the Mission. At a meeting of the friends of the  
enterprise this energetic lady confided her views  
to the eminent Christian and capitalist, Daniel  
Drew. He espoused them with warmth; and  
mainly through his exertions the Old Brewery  
building—the nest of some four to five hundred of  
the poorest and worst class of our population—was  
purchased by the Mission. Workmen were at once  
engaged to fit the establishment for its new uses ;  
and, in a short time, convenient school-rooms, a  
neat chapel, and suitable offices were contrived.  
At the present time the Mission is doing a world  
of good. It is one of the largest and most admir-  
able benevolent institutions in the country. Som  
  
three hundred and fifty-one children, of both sex-  
es, are educated daily in the building, and every

 solemn pages of Dr. Sancer’s book.’ Late  
the other afternoon, hurrying at night-fall for the last boat to the ‘ Cottage,’ in a  
soft, warm, clean snow-storm, we thought of these lines, and wished that we knew  
  
who wrote them:  
  
Ox! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
  
Over the heads of the people you meet ;  
Dancing,  
  
ae  
  
kimming along,  
Beautiful snow! it can do nothing wrong.  
Flying to kiss a fair lady’s cheek ;  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel, and fickle as love!  
  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by,  
It lights up the face, and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around :  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song!  
How the gay sledges, like meteors flash by,  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye:  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow :  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To 7. trampled in mud by the crowd rushing  
  
y:  
To bosremagied and tracked by the thousands  
of feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible  
street.

a9 the snow-flakes, from Heaven — to  
ell :  
  
Fell, to be trampled as filth of the street :  
  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on, and beat.

Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
  
Merciful Gop! have I fallen so low?  
  
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow!

Snow.  
  
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below ;  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along,  
Beautiful snow ! it can do nothing wrong.  
Flying to kiss a fair lady’s cheek ;  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak.  
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel, and fickle as love !  
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow !  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go !  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays iu its glee with every oue.  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by,  
It lights up the face, and it sparkles the eye ;  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around :  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coiniug ot beautiful snow.  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song !  
How the gay sledges, like meteors flash by,  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye :  
Kinging.  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow :  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
Tobe trampled in mad by the crowd rushing by:  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands  
of feet,  
Till it blends with filth in the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell :  
Fell like the snow-flakes, from Heaven—to bell:  
Fell, to be trampled as tilth of the street:  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat.  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God ! have 1 fallen so low !  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow!  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its  
glow :  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charm of my face.  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sister, all,  
God, and myself I have lost hv my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest 1 wander toouigli :  
For of alt that is on or about me, 1 know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful  
snow.  
How strange it should be that this beautiful  
snow  
Should fall on a sinner with uo where to go !  
How strange it would be, when the night comes  
again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate  
bruin !  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone!  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town,  
Gone mad in their joy at the suow’s coming  
down ;  
To lie and to die in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow !  
The ensuing exquisite little article was pre­  
pared In a mining cabin, inhabited by oue of the  
good aud true of the earth.

Hailing each other with humour and song  
1 How the gay sledges, like meteors  
flash by, Bright for the moment, then  
lost to to the eye: Ringing, Swinging,  
Dashing they go Over the crust of the  
beautiful snow : Snow so pure when it  
falls from the sky, To be trampled in  
mud by the crowd rushing by; To be  
trampled and tracked by the thousand of  
feet, Till it blends with the horrible  
filth of the street. Once I was pure as  
the snow-but I fell Fell, like the snow  
flakes from Heaven to HellFell, to be  
trampled as filth in the streetFell, to  
be scoffed, to be spit on and beat J  
Pleading, Cursing, Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living, and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God ! have I fallen so low 1  
And yet I was once like this beautiful  
snow! Once I was fair as the beautiful  
snow, With an eye like its crystals, a  
heart like its glow Once I was loved for  
my innocent grace Flattered and sought  
for the charm of my face, Father,  
Mother, Sister, and all, God, and myself  
I have lost by my fall, The veriest  
wretch that goes shivering by Will take  
a wide sweep lest I wander to-nigh; For  
of all that is on or about me, I know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the  
beautiful snow. How strange it should be  
that this beautiful snow Should fall on  
a sinner with nowhere to go; How strange  
it would be when the night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my  
desperate brain Fainting, Freezing,  
Dying alone! Too wicked for prayer, too  
weak for my moan To be heard in the  
crash of the crazy town, Gone mad in  
their joy at the snow&#x27;s coming down To  
lie and to die in my terrible woe, With  
a bed and a shroud of the beautiful  
snow!

Once I was Pure.  
The following poem we regard as one of the most  
touchingly beautiful in the language, and well worthy  
of attentive perusal by every reader:  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and earth below;  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flitting,  
Skimming along.  
Beantiful snow! it can&#x27;t do nothing wreng,  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow from the heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, as gentle as love!  
  
Oh; the snow the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun.  
It plays in its glee with every one,  
Chasing,  
Laughing.  
Hurrying by,  
It lights up the face, and it sparkles the eye!  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around.  
The town is alive and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song!  
How the gay siedges, like meteors, flash by,  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye;  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beantiful snow;  
Snow so pure when it falts from the sky,  
To be trampled in the mud by the crowd rushing  
by,  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street  
Once I was pure as the snow--but I fell!  
Fell like the snow-flakes, from heaven to hell,  
Fell to be trampled as filth of the street,  
Fell to be scoffed to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading.  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy.  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead;  
Merciful Godl have I faller so low?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair like the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its glow,  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face;  
Father.  
Mother,  
Sisters, all,  
iod, and myself I have lost by my fall:  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by,  
Will take a wide sweep, least I wander to nigh  
Fot all that is on or above me, I know,  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautifu  
show  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with now here to gol  
How strange it should be, when the night comas  
again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate  
brain  
Fainting,  
Freezing.  
Dying alone,  
To wicked for prayer to weak for my moan  
To be heard in my crazy town.  
ione mad in the jey of the snow coming down,  
To lie and to die in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beantiful snow.

And yet I was once like this beautiful snow!  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow ;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charm of my face.  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters all,  
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh;  
For of all that is on or about me, I know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful snow.  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go !  
How strange it would be, when tho night comes  
again.  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone!  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow&#x27;s coming down ;  
To lie and to die in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow!

ThE SnOW.  
Since the publication  
en nothing equal to the following poem  
Hood, we have seen  
in point of smooth versification, flowing tythm and  
touching pathos. The plaintive wail of a woman&#x27;s lost  
honor will bring tears to every sensitive breast. The au­  
thor and subject of the piece was an actress of some repu­  
tation, who formerly lived in St. Louis in great style and  
magnificence. She was connected by marriage with some  
of the first people of the country, and to those who knew  
her the poem will be doubly attractive--a woman of great  
genius and surparsing beauty, fallen from her proud es­  
tate, paints her own soul and left the world see the re­  
morse written upon it in such terrible letters.Erchange.  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow.  
Filling the sky and earth below;  
Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet.  
Dancing.  
Flirting.  
Skimming along;  
Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong,  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow frem the heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as love!  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go  
Whiling about in the maddening fun.  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chacing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by;  
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye,  
And the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow!  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song!  
How the gay sledges, like meteors, flash by,  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye  
Ringing,  
Swingin  
Dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow:  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowds rushing by,  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow--but I fell!  
Fell like the snow-flakes from heaven to hell:  
Fell to be trampled as filth of the street;  
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading,  
Cureing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread.  
Hating the living and fearing the dead;  
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
Vith an eye like its crystal, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face!  
Father.  
Mother,  
Sisters, all.  
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall;  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by,  
Will make a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh;  
For all that is on or above me I know,  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautiful snow.  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
How strange it should be, when the night comes  
again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my derperate brain.  
Painting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town.  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down,  
To be, and so die in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow.

The Snow.   
[Since the publication of the Bridge of Sighs, by  
Hood, we have seen nothing to equal the following  
poem in point of smooth versification, flowing  
rhythm and touching pathos. The plaintive wail of  
woman’s lost honor will bring tears to every sensi­  
tive breast. The author and subject of the piece  
was an actress of some reputation in the States, and  
who formerly lived in St. Louis in great style and  
magnificence. She was connected by marriage with  
some of the first people of the country, and to those  
who knew her the poem will be doubly attractive;  
a woman of great genius and surpassing beauty,  
fallen from her proud estate, paints her own soul  
and lets the world see the remorse written upon it in  
such terrible letters -.—Montreal Transcript.}

How strange it should be that this beautiful enow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go I  
How strange it should be, when the night comes  
again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain.  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked for a prayer, too weak for a mogi &#x27;  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town  
Gona mad irvSArfs jy of the snow coming down,  
To be, anJae, in my terrible woe,

Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along—  
Beautiful snow? it can do no wrong!  
Flying to kiss a fair lady’s cheek;  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome Ireak;  
Beautiful snow from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel, and tickle as love.  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Cheering,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by,  
It lights upon the face, and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around;  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of the beautiful suow.  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song!  
How the gay sledges like meteors pass by.  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye;  
Kinging,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow!  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;  
To be (racked and trampled by the thousands of  
feel!  
Till it blends in the filth of the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven - to hell;  
Fell, to be trampled as filth in the street;  
Fell, to be scoffed at, to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die;

Haling the living, fearing the dead.

GSince the publication of the &quot;Bridge of  
Sighs,&quot; by Hood, we have seen nothing equal  
to the following poem in point of smooth  
versification, flowing rhythm, and tonching  
pathos. The plaintive wall of a woman&#x27;s  
lost honor will bring tears to every sensitive  
breast:  
On! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and earth below  
Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the peoplo you meet.  
Dancing,  
Flirting.  
Skimming along;  
Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong,  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow from the heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as love!  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go,  
Whirling al out in the maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by;  
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye,  
And the dogs, with a hark and a bound,

How strange it should he, when the night comes

If the snow and the ice struck my, desperate

Fainting,  
Freezing.  
Dying alone.  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan,

Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down,  
To lie, and so die in my terrible woe,

THE SNOW.  
Since the publication of the &quot;Bridge of Sighs,&quot;  
by Hood, we have seen nothing equal to th  
following poem in point of smooth versifica­  
tion, flowing rythm and touching pathos. The  
plaintive wail of a woman&#x27;s lost honor will  
bring tears to every sensitive breast. The au­  
thor and subject of the piece was an actress  
of some reputation, who fermerly lived in St.  
Louis in great style and magnificence. She  
was connected by marriage with some of the  
  
first people of the country, and to thoss who  
  
doubly

For all that is on or above me I know  
There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautiful  
snow.  
How strange it should be that this beautiful  
snow  
Should fall on a sinner nowhere to go !  
How strange it should be, when the night  
comes auain,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate  
brain,  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone.  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming

To be so and die in my terrible woe,

Once I Was Pure.  
  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
the sky and earth below;  
Over the bouNefion , „ over the street, •  
°ye; the heads of the people you meet,  
Dancing,  
Siz :ram ing along,  
Beautiful snow! It can do nothing wrong  
Flying to kiss n fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging o 1; ps in a froliesmne freak;  
Beatrt/ col snow float the Heaven above,  
Pare as an:int:et, prat le as love!  
  
Oh! the snow, toe beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
\Vhirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one;  
Chasing  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by,  
It lights up the face, and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dugs with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around ;  
The town is alive, and its heart In a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow!  
  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song;  
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by,  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye;  
Ringing,  
  
Swinging,  
  
Dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow;  
Snow scipure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by ;  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet,  
Till It blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I tell!  
Fell like the snow flakes from Heaven to hell;  
Fell to be trampled as filth of the street;  
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and heat;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead;  
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow.  
  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face;  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters, all,  
God, and myself I have lost by my fall;  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh;  
For all that is on or above me, I know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautiful  
snow.  
  
now strange it should be that this beautiful  
  
snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere logo!  
How strange it should be, when the night comes  
again,  
If the snow and the lee struck my desperate  
brain;  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying atone;  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for moan  
To be heard in the crazy town,  
pone mad in the Joy of the snow coining down;  
To lie and to die in my terrible woe,  
&#x27;ith a bed and a shroml, of the healthful snow

alive and its heart in a glow, To  
welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
How widely the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humour and song!  
How the gay sledges like meteors flash

they go, Over the crust of the beautiful  
snow— Snow so pure when it falls from  
the sky, As to make one regret to see it  
lie, To be trampled and tracked by the  
thousands of feet, Till it blends with  
the filth in the horrible street. Once I

I know, There is nothing so pure as the  
beautiful snow. How strange it should be  
that this beautiful snow Should fall on  
a sinner with nowhere to go ! How  
strange it should be when the night  
comes again, If the snow and the ice  
struck my desperate brain, Fainting —  
Freezing— Dying alone, Too wicked for  
prayer, too weak for a moan To be heard  
in the streets of the crazy town, Gone  
mad in the joy of snow coming down ; To  
be and to die in my terrible woe, With a  
bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow.  
Helpless and foul as the trampled snow,  
Sinner, despair not ! Christ stoopeth

_ . . -r, : sxl  
In the early part of the Avar, one  
dark Saturday morning in the dead of  
printer, there died at the&#x27; Commercial  
Hospital, Cincinnati, a young woman over  
whose head only two-and-twenty sum­  
mers had passed. She had once been  
possessed of an enviable share of beauty:  
had been, as she herself said, “flattered  
and sought for the charms of her face,  
but, alas! upon her fair brow had long  
been written that terrible word—prosti­  
tute ! Once the pride of respectable par­  
entage, her first wrong step was the  
small beginning of the “same old story  
over again,” which has been the only.  
life-history of thousands. Highly edu­  
cated and accomplished in manners, she  
might have shone in the best of society.  
But the evil hour that proved her ruin  
was but the door from childhood; and  
having spent a young life in disgrace  
and shame, the poor mendless one died  
the melancholy death of a broken heart­  
ed outcast.  
Among her personal effects was found,  
in manuscript, the “Beautiful Snow,”  
which was immediately carried to Enos  
B. Reed, a gentleman of culture and  
literary tastes, who was at that time  
editor of the National Union. In the  
columns of that paper, on the morning  
following the girl’s death, the poem ap­  
peared in print for the first time. r,Whejt  
the paper containing the poem came out  
on Sunday morning, the body of the vic­  
tim had not yet received burial. The  
attention of Thomas Buchanan Read, *  
one of the first American poets, was soon  
directed to the newly published lines,  
who was so taken with the stirring . pa­  
thos, that he immediately followed the  
corpse to its final resting plaoe.  
&#x27; Such are the .plain facts concerning  
her whose “Beautiful Snow” will long  
be regarded as one of the brightest gems  
in American literature.

Snow.  
Ob ! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and earth below .  
Over the house tops, over the street,  
Over t he head of the people you meet,  
Dancing,  
Flirting ;  
Skimming along :  
Beautiful snow ! it can do 110 wrong,  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lip in a frolicsome freak.  
Beautiful snow from the Heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as love !  
Oh the snow, the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go  
Whirling about in the maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by ;  
It lights on the face and sparkles the eye !  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around :  
The town is alive, and it&#x27;s heart a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow !  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song,  
How the gay sledges, like meteors, ilash by,  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye ;  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow :  
Suow so (iure when it falls from the sky;  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands  
[of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible  
[street.  
Onee I was pure as the snow—but I fell,  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven to hell.  
Fell to be trampled as tilth 011 the street,  
Fell to be scoffed, {0 be spit 011 and beat ;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Haling the living and fearing the dead,  
Merciful God &#x27; have I fallen so low ?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow !  
Oneo I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its  
[glow ;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace,  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face!  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters, all,  
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall,  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by,  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh;  
For all that is on or above me ; I know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautiful  
[snow  
How strange it should be that this beautiful  
[snow  
Should fall ou a sinner with nowhere to go !  
How strange it should be, when the night

If the suow and the ice struck my desperate  
[brain ;  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked (&quot;or prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down,  
To lie, and to die in my terrible woe.

&#x27; BEAUTIFUL SNOW.  
[ln the early part of the American war, one ‘dark  
Saturday morning in the dead of winter, there died at  
the Commercial Hospital, Cincinnati, a young woman  
over whose head only two-and-twenty summers had  
passed. She had once been possessed of an enviable  
share of beauty, had been, as she herself said, “fiat­  
tered and sought for the charms of her face;” but,  
alas! upon her fair brow had long been written that  
terrible word—fallen! Once the pride of respectable  
parentage, her first wrong step was the small begin­  
ing of the ““same old story over again,” which has been  
‘the only life-history of thousands. Highly educated  
and accomplished in manners, she might have shone  
in the best of society. But the evil hour that proved  
her ruin was out the door from childhood; and hav­  
ing spent a young life in shame, the poor friendless  
one died the melancholy death of a hroken-hearted  
outeast.  
Among her personal effects was found, in manu­  
script, the “Beautiful Snow,” which was immediately  
carried to Enos B. Reed, a gentleman ofculture and lit  
erary tastes,iwho was at that time editor of the National  
Union. In the culumns of that paper, on the morning  
following the girl’s death, the poem appeared in print  
for the first time. When the paper containing the ‘  
poem came out on Sunday morning, the body of &amp; ~,  
victim had not yet received burial, The attention o.  
Thomas Buchanan Reede, one of the best American  
poets, was soon directed to the newly published lines,  
who was so taken with their stirring pathos, that he |  
immediately followed the corpse to its final resting ‘  
place. |  
Such are the plaiu facts concerning her whose “Beau- 1  
tiful Snow” will long beregarded as one of the highest |  
gems in American literature.] |  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow, |

Too wicked for Fruyer. too weak for a moan  
To be heard in the streets of the brazen town  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down;  
To be and to die in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of beautiful snow.  
Helpless and foul as the trampled snow,  
Sinner, desgair not! Chrigt stoopeth low  
To rescue the soul that is lost in sin,  
And raise it to life and enjoyment again.  
Gronnins—Bleeding—Dying for thee,  
The erucified hung on the cursed tree!

“Is there mercy for me&#x27;! Will he heed my weak

Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow,

had long been written that terrible word—  
FALLEN ! Ounce the pride of respectable pa­  
rentage, her first wrong step was the “small  
beginning” of the *‘same old story over again,”  
which has been the only life-history of thou­  
sands. Highly educated and accomplishad in  
wmanners, she might have been a leading star  
of the most brilliant and refined society.—  
“Might have been,” did we say I—  
“Of all the words of tongue or pen,  
The saddest are these—it might have been!”  
But the evil hour that proved her ruin was out  
the door from childbood ; and having spent a  
young life in shame, the poor friendless one  
died the melancholy death of a broken hearted  
outeast.  
Among her personal effects was found, in  
manuzcript, the “Beautitul Snow,” which was  
immediately carried to Euos B. Reed, a gentle­  
wan of culture and literary taste, who was at  
that time editor of the National Union. In the  
colmmus of that paper, on the morning follow­  
ing the girl&#x27;s death,the poewm uppeared in print  
for the first time. When the paper containing  
the puem came eut on Sunday morning, the  
body of the poor unfortanate woman had not  
yet received burial. The attention of Thomas  
Buchanan Read one of the best American  
poets, was soon directed to the newly publish­  
ed lines, who was so taken with their stirring  
pathos, that he immediately tollowed the corpse  
to its final resting.  
Such are the plain facts concerning her  
whose “Beautiful Snow” will long be regard

EEAUTIFUL SNOW.  
  
In the early part of the American  
war, one dark Saturday morning in  
the dead of winter, there died at the  
Commercial Hospital, Cincinnati, a  
young woman over whose head only  
two-and-twenty summers had passed  
he had once been possessed of an en  
viable share of beauty, had been, as  
she herself said, &quot;flattered and sought  
for the charms of her face; but alas!  
pon her fair brow had long been writ-  
ten that terrible word--fallen! Once  
the pride of respectable parentage, her  
first wrong step was the small begin-  
ing of the &quot;same old story over again,&quot;  
which has been the only life-history  
of thousands. Highly educated and  
accomplished in manners, she might  
have shone in the best society. But  
the evil hour that proved her ruin was  
out the door from childhood; and hav  
ing spent a young life in shame, the  
poor friendless one died the melan  
choly death of a broken-hearted out­  
cslinong her personal effects was  
found, in manuscript the &quot;Beautiful  
Snow,&quot; which was immediately car­  
ried to Enos B. Reed, a gentleman of  
culture and literary tastes, who was at  
that time editor of the National  
Union. In the columns of that paper,  
on the morning following the girl&#x27;s  
death, the poem appeared in print for  
the first time. When the paper con­  
taining the poem came out on Sunday  
morning, the body of the victim had  
not yet received burial. The atten­  
tion of Thomas Buchanan Read, one  
of the best American poets, was soon  
directed to the newly published lines,  
who was so taken with their stirring  
pathos, that he immediately followed  
the corpse to its final resting place.  
Such are the plain facts concerning  
her whose &quot;Beautiful Snow&quot; will long  
be regarded as one of the highest gems  
of American literature.  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and earth below,  
Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing--Flirting--Skimming along,  
Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong:  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lips in frolicksome freak:  
Beautiful snow from heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as lve!  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go,  
Whirling about in maddening fun:  
Chasing--Laughing- Hurrying by.  
It lights on the face, and it sparkles the eye;  
And the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals as they eddy around:  
The town is alive and its heart is a-glow  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow!  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song:  
How the gay sleighs like meteors flash by,  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye;  
Ringing- Swinging- Dashing they go  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow:  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled and tracked by thousands of  
fect.  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible  
street.  
Once I was pure as the snow, but I fell,  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven to hell;  
Fell to be trampled as filth on the street.  
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading- Cursing- Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy;  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God, have I fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow-  
How strange it should be that this beautiful  
snow  
Shoald fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
How sicane it shonld he whan t  
comes again,  
if the snow and the ice struck by desperate  
o wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan  
be heard in the streets of the brazen town  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming  
down;  
To be and to die in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of beautiful snow.  
Helpless and foul as the trampled snow,  
inner, despair not! Christ stoopeth low  
To rescue the soul that is lost in sin,  
And raise it to life and enjoyment again.

Beautiful Snow.  
[In the early part of the late war, one dark  
Saturday morning in the dead of winter,  
there died at the Commercial Hospital in  
Cincinnati a young woman twenty-two years  
of age. She was very beautiful and had once  
been, as she says, &quot;flattered and nought for  
tbe charms of her face,&quot; but alas! upou her  
fair brow had long been written that terrible  
word &quot;fallen.&quot;  
Among her personal effects was found in  
manuscript the &quot;Beautiful Snow&quot; which was  
at once recognized as a literary gem.]  
Oh ! the enow, the beautitul snow

Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;

goes swaying along, Hailing each other  
with humour and song; How the gay  
sleighs like meteors flash by, Bright  
for a moment, then lost to the eye.  
Kinging-swinging-dashing they go, Over  
the crust of the beautihil snowSnow so  
pure when it falls from the sky As to  
makd&#x27;one regret to see it lie, To be  
trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet, Till it blends with the filth in  
the horrible street. Once I was pure as  
the snow-but I fell! Fell like the  
snowflakes from heaven to hell, Fell to  
be trampled as filth in the street, Fell  
to be scoffed, spit on, and beat.  
Pleading-cursing-dreading to die ;  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy;  
Dealing in shame for a morse1 of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God, have I fallen so low. And  
yet I was once like the beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like a crystal and a heart  
like its glow; Once I was loved for my  
innocent grace, Flattered and sought for  
the charms of my face! Father, mother,  
and sisters all, God and myself, I have  
lost by my fall; The veriest wretch that  
goes shivering by Will make a wide sweep  
lest I wander too nigh. For ail that is  
on or before me, I know There&#x27;s nothing  
so pure as the beautiful snow. How  
strange it should be that this beautiful  
snow Should fall on a sinner with  
nowhere to go ! How strange it should be  
when the night comes again If the snow  
and the ice struck my desperate brain !  
Fainting-freezing-dying alone ! Too  
wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy  
town, Gone mad in the joy of the snow  
coming down! To be and to die in my  
terrible woe, With a bed and a shroud of  
the beautiful snow. Helpless and foul as  
the trampled snow, Sinner, despair not!  
Christ Btoopeth low To rescue the soul  
that is lost in its sin, And to raise it  
to life and enjoyment again; Groaning-  
bleeding-dying for thee, The Crucified  
hung on the accursed tree ! HiB accents  
of mercy fell soft on thine ear. Is  
there mercy for me? Will He heed my weak  
prayer ? Oh God ! in the stream that for  
sinners did flow, Wash me and I shall be  
whiter than snow.

## [POETRY. "BEAUTIFUL SNOW."](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/162335570)

#### From _Adelaide Observer (SA : 1843 - 1904)_

#### 1899-04-08 &middot; [Adelaide, South Australia](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adelaide)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

BEAUTIFUL SNOW,&quot; un repiy. to a  
correspondent in-a borne paper, the  
following story of this poem—which is  
regarded as one of tlie brightest gems  
in American literature—is given;—In  
the., early part of the war, one dark  
Saturday morning in&#x27; the dead ol winter,  
there died at the Commercial- Hospital,  
Cincinnati, a young woman, over whose  
head only two-and-twenty summers had  
passed. &gt; She had once been possessed of  
an enviable share of beauty—had been, as  
she .herself said, &quot;flattered and sought  
for the charms of her face;&quot; hut, alas,  
upon her fair brow had long been written  
the terrible word—fallen! Once the  
-pride hi respectable parentage, ber  
first wrong step was the small beginning  
of the &quot;same old story over again,&quot;  
which has been the. only, life history  
of thousands. Highly educated and  
accomplished in manrcrs, she might have  
shone in the best of society. But the  
evil hour that proved her ruin was but  
the door from childhood; and having  
spent a young life in disgrace and shame  
the poor friendless one died the  
melancholy death of a&#x27; broken-hearted  
outcast. Among her personal effects was  
found in manuscript the &quot;Beautiful  
Snow,&quot; which was immediately carried to  
a gentleman ot culture and literary  
taste, who was at that time Editor of  
the &quot;National Union.&quot; In the columns of  
that paper on the morning following the  
girl&#x27;s death the poem&#x27; appeared in  
.print for the first time. Allien the  
paper containing the poem came-out on  
Sunday morning the body of the victim  
had not yet received burial. The  
attention of one of the first American  
poets was soon directed to the newly  
published lines, who was so taken with  
their stirring pathos that he  
immediately followed the corpse to its  
final resting-place.!  &quot;BEAUTIFUL SNOW.&quot;  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over tlie housetops, over the street,  
over the heads of the people you meet. .  
, Dancing, flirting, skimming  
along—beautiful snow! it can do nothing  
wrong; Flying to kiss a fair lady s  
cheek, clinging to lips in frolicsome  
freak; Beautiful snow, from the heavens  
above—pure as an angel, gentle as love!  
Oh! the snow, tlie beautiful snow, liow  
the flakes gather and.laugh as&#x27;tliey go,  
Whirling about in their maddening fun—it  
plays, in its glee, with every one;  
Chasing, laughing, hurrying by, it  
lights on the face and sparkles tlie  
eye; And the dogs, with a bark and a  
bound, snap at the crystals that eddy  
around— The town is alive and its heart  
in a glow, to wel come the coming of  
beautiful snow. How blithely the crowd  
goes swaying along, hail ing each other  
with humour and song. How i.ne gay  
siedges, like meteors, flash by, bright  
for a moment, then lost to the eye.  
Ringing, swinging, dashing they go, over  
the crust of the beautiful snow; Snow so  
pure, when it falls from the sky, as to  
make one regret to see it lie, To be  
trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet, till it blends with the filth iu  
the horrible street. Once I was pure as  
the snow, but I fell—fell, like the  
snowflakes. from heaven to hell; Fell,  
to be trampled as filth in the  
street—fell, to be scoffed, to be spit  
on, and heat; Pleading, cursing,  
dreading to die; selling my soul to  
whoever would buy; Dealing in shame for  
a morsel of bread; hating the living and  
fearing the dead. .Merciful God, have I  
fallen so low; and yet— 1 was once like  
the beautiful snow. Once I was fair as  
the beautiful snow, with an eye like ils  
crystal and heart like its glow. Once I  
was loved for my innocent grace—flat  
tered and sought, for the charms of my  
face. Father, mother, sister, and all,  
God and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering  
by will make a wide swoop lest 1 wander  
loo nigh. For all that is on or above  
me, I know there is nothing so pure as  
the beautiful snow. How strange it  
should be that this beautiful snow  
should fall on a sinner, with nowhere to  
go. How strange it should bS, when night  
comes again, if the snow and the ice  
struck my desperate brain. Fainting,  
freezing, dying alone; too wicked for  
prayer, loo weak for a moan To be heard  
in the streets of the crazy town; gone  
mad in the joy of the snow coming down—  
To lie, and to die, in my terrible woe,  
with a bed and a shroud of the beautiful  
snow. Helpless and foul as the trampled  
snow; sinner, despair Jiol; Christ  
stoopeth low To rescue the soul that is  
lost in its sin, and raise it to life  
and enjoyment again Groaning, bleeding,  
dying for thee; the Crucified hung on  
the accursed tree; His accents of mercy  
fall soft on -thine ear—Is there mercy  
for me?—Will he heed my prayer? 0 God!  
in the stream that for sinners doth  
flow, wash me, and 1 shall be whiter  
than snow

BEAUTIFUL SNOW.&#x27; lln reply to a  
correspondent in a bom* aper, tbe  
following story of this poem— which is  
regarded as one of tbe brightest gems in  
American li»»r9,nrM ? 1^ -rii-»n- ? In  
fh» .firlV n»rt ftf llw war, one dark  
Saturday miming in the dead o! winter,  
there died at the Commercial Hospital,  
Cincinnati, a young woman, over whose  
bead only two-and-Utoty cummers had  
passed. SI* had once been possessed of  
an enviable share of beauty— had been,  
as »he herself said, &#x27;nattered and  
sought tor the charms of her face;&#x27; but,  
alas, upon her fair brow bad long been  
written the terrible word— fallen! Once  
tbe pride of respectable, parentage, her  
first wrong step was the small beginning  
of the &#x27;same old story over again.&#x27;  
which has born the only life history of  
thousands. Highly educated and  
accomplished in manrers, she might have  
shone in tbe best of society. But the  
evil hour that proved her ruin vu but  
the door from childhood; and having  
spent a young life in difgrace and shame  
the poor friendless one died the  
melancholy deatli of a broken-hearted  
outcast. Among her personal effects was  
found in manuscript the &#x27;Beautiful  
Snow,&#x27; which waa immediately carried to  
a gentleman ot culture and literary  
taste, who was at that time Editor of  
the &#x27;National Union.&#x27; In the columns of  
that paper on the morninj following the  
girl&#x27;s death the poem appeared in print  
Ior the irct time. When the paper  
containing the poem came out on Sunday  
morning tbe body of the victim bad not  
yet received burial. The attention of  
one of the first American poet* was soon  
directed to tbe newly published line*,  
who was so taken with tbeir stirring  
pathos that be immediately followed tbe  
corpse to iu final resting-pUce.1  1  
&#x27;BEAUTIFUL SNOW.&#x27; Oh! the snow, tbe  
beautiful snow! filling the efcy and the  
earth below; Over the housetop*, over  
the street, over the beads of the people  
you meet. , Daseing, flirting, skimming  
along— beautiful snow! it can do nothing  
wrong; Flying to U.«s a Uir lady&#x27;s  
cheek, dinging to lips in frolicsome  
freak; -Beautiful snow, from the heavens  
above— pun as an angel, gentle as love!  
Oh! the snow, tbe beautiful snow, how  
the flakes gather and laugh as they go.  
Whirling about in thtif maddening fun—  
it plays. In iu gl?e, with every one;  
Chasing, laughing, hurrying by, it  
lights en the :&#x27;jce and iparkles tbe  
eye; And the dogs, with a bark and a  
bound, snap at tbe crystals that eddy  
kround— Tike town Is alive and its heart  
in a glow, to welcome tbe coming of  
&#x27;beautiful snow. How blithely the crowd  
goes aravinf alone, hailing each other  
with humour and song. How tne gay  
sledges, like meteor*, Huh by, bright  
for a moment, then lost to the eye.  
Ringing, ?&#x27; swinging, dashing they go,  
over the crust of the beautiful snow;  
Snow so pure, when it falls from the  
sky, as to make one regret to see it  
lie, To be trampled and tracked by tbe  
thousands of feet, till it blends with  
the filth in the nor&#x27; rible street. Once  
I was pure as the mow, but I fell— fell,  
like the snownakes. from heaven to hell;  
Fell, to he trampled as filth in tbe  
street— tell, to be scoffed, to be spit  
on. and beat; Pleading, cursing,  
dreading to die; selling my soul to  
whoever would buy: ? Dealing in shame  
tor a morsel of bread; hating the living  
and fearing the dead. Merciful God, have  
I fallen so low; and yet— I was one*  
like the beautiful snow. Once I was fair  
as the beautiful snow, with an eye like  
it* crystal and heart like it* glow.  
Once I was loved tor my innocent grace—  
fiat-tered and sought, for the charms ot  
my face. Father, mother, sister, and  
all, God and myself, I hava lost by my  
falL The veriest wretch that goes  
shivering by will make a wide swoop lest  
I wander too nigh. For all that is on or  
above me, I know there is nothing so  
pure as the beautiful snow. How strange  
it should be that this beautiful snow  
should fall on a sinner, with nowhere,  
to go. How strange it should be, when  
night comes again, if the now and tbe  
ice struck my desperate brain. Fainting,  
treexing, dying alone; too wicked for  
prayer, too weak for a moan To be heard  
in the streets ot the craar town; gone -  
mad in the joy of the snow coming downTo  
lie; and to die, in my terrible woe,  
with a bed and a shroud of the beautiful  
snow. Helpless and fool as tbe trampled  
snow; sinner, despair not; Christ  
stoopeth low To rwcue the soul that is  
lost in its sin, and raise it to life  
and enjoyment again— Oroaning, Weeding,  
dying for thee; the Cradled ? hung on  
the accursed tree: ?it accent* of mercy  
tall soft ea thine ear-Is there mercy  
tor met— Will he need my pcayert O God!  
in the stream that tor sinners dc*h
