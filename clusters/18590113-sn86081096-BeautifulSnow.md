Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along.  
Beautiful snow! it can do nothing wrong;  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek:  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel and fickle as love!  
  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one,  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by.  
It lights up the face and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around.  
The town is alive and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song;  
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by—  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye,  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go.  
Over the crest of the beautiful snow,  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;  
Fell, like the snow-flakes, from heaven—to hell!  
Fell, to be trampled as the filth of the street;  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow!  
  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face,  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters all,  
God and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh,  
For of all that is on or about me, I know,  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful snow.  
  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
How strange it would be, when the night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone!  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of this crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow coming down,  
To lie and to die in my terrible wo,  
With a bed and a shroud of beautiful snow!

O! the snow, the beautiful snow, Filling  
the sky and tbe earth below; Over the  
housetops, over tbe street, Over the  
heads of the people you meet; Dancing,  
Flirting, Skimming along. Beautiful  
snow! it can do nothing wrong: Flying to  
kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek; Clinging to  
lips in a frolicsome freak; Beautiful  
snow from the heavens above, Pure as an  
angel and fickle as love! O! the snow,  
the beautiful snow! How the flakes  
gather and laugh as they go; Whirling  
about in its maddening ton, It plays in  
its glee with every one. Chasing,  
-Laughing,  Hurrying by. It lights up  
the face and it sparkles the eye; And  
even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around;  
The town is alive, and its heart in a  
glow, To welcome the coming of the  
beautiful snow. How the wild crowd goes  
swaying along, Hailing each other with  
humour and song! How the gay sledges  
like meteors flash by, Bright for the  
moment then lost to the eye; Singing,  
Swinging, Dashing they go Over the crust  
of the beautiful snow; Snow so pure when  
it falls from the sky, To be trampled iu  
mud by the crowd rushing by, To be  
trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet, Till it blends with the horrible  
filth of the street. Once I was pure as  
the snow — but I fell — Fell, like tbe  
snow-flakes, from Heaven to HellFell, to  
be trampled as filth in the streetFell,  
to he scoffed, to be spit on, and beat;  
Pleading, Cursing, Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living, and fearing tbe dead.  
Merciful God, have I fallen so low? And  
yet I was once like this beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart  
like its glow; Once I was loved for my  
innocent grace — Flattered and sought  
for the charms of my face: Father,  
Mother, Sister, and all, God, and  
myself, I have lost by my fall; The  
veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep lest I wander too  
nigh; . For of all that is on or about  
me I know There is nothing that&#x27;s pure  
but tbe beautiful snow. How strange it  
should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to

desperate brain! How strange it would be  
when the night comes again Fainting,  
Freezing, Dying alone! Too wicked for  
prayer, too weak for my moan To be heard

Oh &#x27; the snow, the beautiful snow.  
Killing the sky and earth below :  
Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet.  
Dancing.  
Flirting.  
t-kimming along;  
Beautiful snow &#x27; it can do no wrong,  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek.  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow from the Heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as love !  
Oh the snow, the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and luugh as they go !  
Whirling about in its maddening fun.  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chasing,  
Laughing.  
Hurrying by;  
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye !  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around ;  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow.  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow !  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song !  
How the gay sledges, like meteors, flash by.  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye;  
Ringing,  
Swinging.  
Dashing they go.  
Over the crust of the beautitul snow ;  
Snow so pure when it talis from the sky.  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,  
To be trampled and tracked by thousands of feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell!  
Fell like the snow-flakes, from Heaven to hell !  
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street;  
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat:  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die.  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy ;  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
lilting the living and fearing the dead;  
Merciful Cod ! have I fallen so low  
And yet 1 was once like the beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow;

For all that is on or above me. I know,

How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go  
How strange it should be, when night comes again  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain,  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone.  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan.

Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along—  
Beautiful snow? it can do no wrong!  
Flying to kiss a fair lady’s cheek;  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome Ireak;  
Beautiful snow from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel, and tickle as love.  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Cheering,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by,  
It lights upon the face, and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around;  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of the beautiful suow.  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song!  
How the gay sledges like meteors pass by.  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye;  
Kinging,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow!  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;  
To be (racked and trampled by the thousands of  
feel!  
Till it blends in the filth of the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven - to hell;  
Fell, to be trampled as filth in the street;  
Fell, to be scoffed at, to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die;  
Selling my soul to whoever wonld buy;  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Haling the living, fearing the dead.  
Merc it nl God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet, I was once like this beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow.  
With an eye like itscrystais, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face;  
Father,  
Mother.  
Sister, all,  
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by;  
Will lake a wide sweep, !est I wander 100 nigh;  
For all that is on or about me, I know  
There’s nothing that’s pure but the beautiful snow;  
How strange it should be that the beautiful snow,  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go.  
How strange it would be when the night comes  
again  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain;  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow’s coming down;  
So lie and to die in my terrible woe.  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful suow!

Snow so pure when it falls from the sky.  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd  
rushing by,  
To be trampled and trackwl by the  
thousands of feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the hor­  
rible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow but I fell !  
Fell like the snow-flakes, from heaven  
to hell;  
Fell, to be trampled as tilth in the street ;  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living, and fearing the dead ;  
Merciful God I have I fallen so low !  
And yet I was once like the beautiful  
snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like the crystal, a heart  
like its glow ;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace.  
Flattered and sought for the charms of  
my face I  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters, all,  
God and myself, I&#x27;ve lost by my fall ;  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering  
by,  
Will make a wide swoop lest I wander  
too nigh ;  
For nil that is on, or above me, I know.  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beau­  
tiful snow.  
How st range it should be that this beau­  
tiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere  
to go !  
How Btrange it should be, when tho  
night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my des­  
perate brain,  
Fuinting, g  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked for prayer, &quot;too weak for a  
moan  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy  
town  
Gone mad in tbe joy of the snow coming  
down, ,  
To be, and so die, in my terrible woo,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beauti­  
ful snow.

Beautiful snow ! beautiful snow !  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the house tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet,  
  
Dancing, flirting, and skimming along ;  
  
Beautiful snow ! oh, it can do no wrong—  
Flying to kiss the fair lady’s cheek,  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak ;  
Beautiful snow, from the heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gent&#x27;e as love!  
  
Beautiful snow ! beautiful snow !  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in their maddening fun ;  
It plays in its glee with every one—  
Chasing, laughing— hurrying all by ;  
It lights on the face, and it sparkles the eye,  
And the dogs with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around—  
‘The town is alive and its heart aglow,  
To welcome the coming of the beautiful snow!  
  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song !  
How the gay sleighs, like meteors flash by,  
3right for the moment, then lost to the eye !  
Ringing, swinging, dancing they go  
Over the icy crest of the beautiful snow:  
Snow so pure, when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd passing by,  
To be trampled and tracked by thousands of feet,  
‘Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
Once she was pure as the snow, but she fell!  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven to hell;  
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street ;  
Fell to be scoffed at, to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading and cursing—dreading to die ;  
Selling her soul to whoever would buy ;  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living, and fearing the dead:  
Merciful God! has she fallen so low?  
And yet she was once like the beautiful snow !  
  
Once she was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its glow;  
Flattered and sought for the charms of her face !  
Father and mother, brother, sister and all—  
God and herself, she lost by her fall.  
The vilest wretch that goes shivering by,  
Makes a wide swoop, lest she wander too nigh ;  
For all there was on or about her, she knew  
There was nothing sg pure as the beautiful snow!  
  
How strange it is that the beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
Strange it would be, when the night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice strike her desperate brain ;  
Fainting and freezing—dying al! alone—

Hinging, swinging, dasliing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful soow —  
Snow so pure when it fiills from Uic

pure when it falls from the sky As to

feet, Till it blends with the filth in

Dealing in shame for a morse1 of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God, have I fallen so low. And  
yet I was once like the beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like a crystal and a heart  
like its glow; Once I was loved for my  
innocent grace, Flattered and sought for  
the charms of my face! Father, mother,  
and sisters all, God and myself, I have  
lost by my fall; The veriest wretch that  
goes shivering by Will make a wide sweep  
lest I wander too nigh. For ail that is  
on or before me, I know There&#x27;s nothing  
so pure as the beautiful snow. How  
strange it should be that this beautiful  
snow Should fall on a sinner with  
nowhere to go ! How strange it should be  
when the night comes again If the snow  
and the ice struck my desperate brain !  
Fainting-freezing-dying alone ! Too  
wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy  
town, Gone mad in the joy of the snow

Orer the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet,  
Dancing, Whirling, Skimming Along.  
Beautiful snow 5 it. can do no wrong;  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lips in frolicsome freak ;  
Beautiful snow from Heaven above, Pure

lights on the face, and it sparkles the  
eye ; And the dogs, with a bark and a  
bound, Snap at the crystals as they eddy  
around ; The town is alive, and its  
heart in a glow, To welcome the coming  
of beautiful snow ! How wild the crowd  
goes swaying along, Hailing each other  
with buinor and song ; How the gay  
fileighs. like meteors flash |by, Bright  
for the moment, then lost to the oyc.  
Ringing — Swinging — Das h in g they go,  
Over the orust of the beautiful snow ;  
Snow so pure wben it falls from ,the

Hell! Fell, to be trampled, a« filth on
