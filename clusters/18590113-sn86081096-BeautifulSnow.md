Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along.  
Beautiful snow! it can do nothing wrong;  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek:  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel and fickle as love!  
  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one,  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by.  
It lights up the face and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around.  
The town is alive and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song;  
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by—  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye,  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go.  
Over the crest of the beautiful snow,  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;  
Fell, like the snow-flakes, from heaven—to hell!  
Fell, to be trampled as the filth of the street;  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow!  
  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face,  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters all,  
God and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh,  
For of all that is on or about me, I know,  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beautiful snow.  
  
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
How strange it would be, when the night comes again,  
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone!  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of this crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow coming down,  
To lie and to die in my terrible wo,  
With a bed and a shroud of beautiful snow!

Oh! the snow, the beautiful a now,  
Filling- the sky and the earth below j  
Oyer the housetop*, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet ;  
Dancing&#x27;, &#x27;  
Flirting1,  
? Skimming&#x27; along,  
Beautiful eoow ! it cou do nothing wrong.  
Flying- to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s check ;  
Clinging to lipb in a frolicsome freak,  
Beautiful snow, lrom the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel, and as fickle as love 1  
Oh ! the snow, the beautifulsnow !  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go !  
Whirling about In its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with everyone.  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by.  
It lights up the face, and it sparkles the eye:  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound.  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around :  
Th ?town is alive, and its heart in a glow.  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along.  
Hailing each other with humor and song,  
IIow the gay sledges, like meteors flash by,  
Bright&#x27;for a moment, then lost to the eye :  
Ringing,  
Swinging-, *  
Dashing- they go  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow :  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled iu mud by thecrowd rushing by ;  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of  
feet,  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow?but I fell:  
Fell, like the snow-flakes, front Heaven?to hell :  
Fell, to be trampled as filth of the street ;  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on, and beat.  
Pleading,  
Cursing-,  
Dreading to die,  
Sellingmy foul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living-and fearing- the dead.  
Mercilul God ! have I fallen so low ?  
And yet 1 was once like this beautiful anow !  
Oncc I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its glow :  
Oncc 1 was loved for my innocent grace?  
Flattered and sought lor the charm of my face.  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sister, nil  
Cod, and myself I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh :  
For of all that is on or a bout ine, 1 know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but ihebeautiful snow.  
now strange it should be that thia beautiful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with no where to go !  
How strange it would be, wncn the night comes  
again,  
If the enow and the ice struck my desperate brain !  
Fainting, 5  
Freezing,  
Dying alone I  
Too kicked for prayer, to weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at ihe snow&#x27;s coming down ;  
To lie and to die in my terrible woe,

Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below;  
Over the housetops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people you meet;  
Dancing,  
Flirting,  
Skimming along—  
Beautiful snow? it can do no wrong!  
Flying to kiss a fair lady’s cheek;  
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome Ireak;  
Beautiful snow from the heavens above,  
Pure as an angel, and tickle as love.  
Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow!  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!  
Whirling about in its maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Cheering,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by,  
It lights upon the face, and it sparkles the eye;  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around;  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of the beautiful suow.  
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song!  
How the gay sledges like meteors pass by.  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye;  
Kinging,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow!  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by;  
To be (racked and trampled by the thousands of  
feel!  
Till it blends in the filth of the horrible street.  
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell;  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven - to hell;  
Fell, to be trampled as filth in the street;  
Fell, to be scoffed at, to be spit on and beat;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die;  
Selling my soul to whoever wonld buy;  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Haling the living, fearing the dead.  
Merc it nl God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet, I was once like this beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow.  
With an eye like itscrystais, a heart like its glow;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face;  
Father,  
Mother.  
Sister, all,  
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall.  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by;  
Will lake a wide sweep, !est I wander 100 nigh;  
For all that is on or about me, I know  
There’s nothing that’s pure but the beautiful snow;  
How strange it should be that the beautiful snow,  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go.  
How strange it would be when the night comes

If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain;  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan  
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town.  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow’s coming down;  
So lie and to die in my terrible woe.

How the gay sledges, like meteors, Hash by  
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye—  
Ringing.  
Swinging,  
Dasliing they go,  
Over the crest of the beautiful snow—  
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rush­  
ing by.  
To ho trampled and tracked by the thou­  
sands of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible  
street.  
Once I was pure as the snow; hut I fell—  
Fell like the snow-llakes—from heaven to  
hell;  
Fell, to be tramped as the filth of the  
street;  
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on, and beat;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die;  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Hating the living and fearing the dead!  
Merciful God! have 1 fallen so low?  
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow.  
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like  
its glow;  
Chicc 1 was loved for my innocent grace,  
Flattered and sought for the charm of my  
face!  
Father,  
Alothcr,  
Sisters, all,  
God and myself, I have lost by my fall!  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by  
Will.take a wide sweep, lest I wander too  
nigh;  
For of all that is ou or about me, 1 know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure but the beau­  
tiful snow.  
How strange it should he that this beauti­  
ful snow  
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!  
How strange it would be, when the uight  
comes again.  
If the snow and the ice struck my desper­  
ate brain!  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone;  
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my  
moan  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy  
town,  
Gone mad in their joy at the snow’s coming  
down;  
To lie and to die, in my terrible woe,  
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful  
snow!

Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and the earth below !  
Over the house-tops, over the street,  
Over the heads of the people Vofc meet—  
Dancing.  
Flirting.  
Skimming along;  
Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong—  
FIving to kiss a fair lady’s cheek,  
Clinging to her lips in a’frolicksome freak —  
Beautiful snow from the heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as love!  
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow !  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go !  
Whirling about in the maddening fun,  
It play&#x27;s in its glee with every one—  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
flurrying by!  
It lights bn the face and sparkles the eve,  
And the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crvatals that eddy around—  
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,  
To welcome the coming of the beautiful suow.

Ob ! the snow, the beautiful snow,  
Filling the sky and earth below .  
Over the house tops, over the street,  
Over t he head of the people you meet,  
Dancing,  
Flirting ;  
Skimming along :  
Beautiful snow ! it can do 110 wrong,  
Flying to kiss a fair lady&#x27;s cheek,  
Clinging to lip in a frolicsome freak.  
Beautiful snow from the Heaven above,  
Pure as an angel, gentle as love !  
Oh the snow, the beautiful snow,  
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go  
Whirling about in the maddening fun,  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chasing,  
Laughing,  
Hurrying by ;  
It lights on the face and sparkles the eye !  
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around :  
The town is alive, and it&#x27;s heart a glow,  
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow !  
How wild the crowd goes swaying along,  
Hailing each other with humor and song,  
How the gay sledges, like meteors, ilash by,  
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye ;  
Ringing,  
Swinging,  
Dashing they go  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow :  
Suow so (iure when it falls from the sky;  
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,  
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands  
[of feet  
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible  
[street.  
Onee I was pure as the snow—but I fell,  
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven to hell.  
Fell to be trampled as tilth 011 the street,  
Fell to be scoffed, {0 be spit 011 and beat ;  
Pleading,  
Cursing,  
Dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,  
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,  
Haling the living and fearing the dead,  
Merciful God &#x27; have I fallen so low ?  
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow !  
Oneo I was fair as the beautiful snow,  
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its  
[glow ;  
Once I was loved for my innocent grace,  
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face!  
Father,  
Mother,  
Sisters, all,  
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall,  
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by,  
Will take a wide sweep, lest I wander too nigh;  
For all that is on or above me ; I know  
There is nothing that&#x27;s pure as the beautiful  
[snow  
How strange it should be that this beautiful  
[snow  
Should fall ou a sinner with nowhere to go !  
How strange it should be, when the night  
(comes again.  
If the suow and the ice struck my desperate  
[brain ;  
Fainting,  
Freezing,  
Dying alone,  
Too wicked (&quot;or prayer, too weak for a moan,  
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,  
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down,  
To lie, and to die in my terrible woe.  
Wit a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow.

freak; Beautiful snow, from the heavens

Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow I How  
the flakes gather and laugh as they go  
Whirling about in their maddening fun;  
It plays in its glee with every one.  
Chasing, laughing, hurrying by, It  
lights on the face and sparkles the eye;  
And the dogs, with a bark and a bound,  
Snap at the crystals that eddy around.  
The town is alive, and it&#x27;s heart&#x27;s in a  
glow, To welcome the comitng of the  
beautiful snow. How wildly the crowd  
goes swaying along, Hailing each other  
with humour and song I How the gay  
sledges like meteors flash by, Bright  
for a moment, then lost to the  
eyehIinging, swinging, dashing they go,  
Over the crust of the beautiful snow;  
Snow, so pure when it falls from the

lie, To be trampled and tracked by the  
thousands of feet Till it blends with  
the filth of the street. Once I was pure  
as the snow, but I fellFell, like the  
snow flakes, from heaven to hell. Fell,  
to be trampled as filth in the  
streetFell, to be scolled, to be spit  
on, and beat. Pleading-carsing-dreading  
to die, Selling my soul to whoever  
ivould buy; Dealing in shame for a

fearing the dead! Merciful God ! have I

in a glow, to welcome tbe coming of  
&#x27;beautiful snow. How blithely the crowd

sledges, like meteor*, Huh by, bright  
for a moment, then lost to the eye.  
Ringing, ?&#x27; swinging, dashing they go,  
over the crust of the beautiful snow;  
Snow so pure, when it falls from the

lie, To be trampled and tracked by tbe

Once 1 was pure ns the snow, but I fell;  
Fell like the snowflakes from heaven  
to hell;  
Fell to be trampled as filth on the street.  
Fell tab« scoffed, to be spit on and  
beat;  
Pleading—cursing—dreading to die,  
Selling my soul to whoever would buy.  
Dealing in shame fora morsel of bread.  
Hating the living and fearing the dead.  
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?  
And yet 1 was once like the beautiful  
snow.  
Once I was fair as tbe beautiful snow,  
With an eye like a crystal, a heart like

Once I was loved for mv innocent grace­  
Flattered and sought for the charm of

Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a

To be heard in tiie streets of the
