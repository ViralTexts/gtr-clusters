changed by adding to those taken by us as many as will make up the Compliment out of those taken by the french, with whom we have an Account since the Exchange in Holland of Those we carried in there, I wish therefore you would as was proposed clear your Prisons of the Americans who have been so long confined there. The Cartels that may arrive at Morlaix, will not be detain’d.  
You may have heard that Accounts upon Oath have been taken in America by Order of Congress, of the British Barbarities committed there. It is expected of me to make a school Book of them, and to have 35. Prints designed here by good artists and engraved each expressing one or more of the different horrid facts, to be inserted in the Book, in order to impress the minds of Children and Posterity with a deep sense of your bloody and insatiable Malice and Wickedness. Every kindness I hear of done by an Englishman to an american Prisoner makes me resolve not to proceed in the Work, hoping a Reconciliation may yet take place. But every fresh Instance of your Devilism weakens that resolution, and makes me abominate the Thought of Reunion with such a People. You my friend have often persuaded me, and I believ’d it, that the war was not theirs nor approv’d by them. But their suffering it so long to continue, and the Wretched Rulers to remain who carry it on, makes me think you have too good an Opinion of Them. ADieu my dear friend and believe me ever, Your most affectionately

nd all that his heart loves starving in  
cold and hunger on the roadside—out  
“under sentence of death,” as even  
Gladstone describes it—if tbat robbed  
and ruined man kills this murderer of  
his family, then the press loads itself  
with “assassin,” “murdererall the  
foulness of the English language is  
heaped upon the man who dares to take  
a defensive part in the chronic war ; the  
war of right against wrong; the war  
that never, never can cease so long as  
the wrong lasts and the sense of right  
remains a part of human nature.  
Franklin, when in Paris, was called on  
to have “thirty-five pictures designed  
and engraved, each expressing one or  
more of the horrid&#x27;barbarities committed  
by the British on the American people,  
to get them into the school books,, in  
order to impress the minds of children  
and posterity with a deep sense of Eng­  
land’s bloody and insatiable nature and  
wickedness.” These are Franklin’s  
words, he adds: “Every fresh in­  
stance of her devilism makes me abomi­  
nate the thought of a reunion with such  
a people.”  
We printed this matter more fully a  
week or two ago. Why d 6 we recur to  
it? Because of the shameful flunkeyism  
shown to the British consul, Archibald,  
in New York, last week. A smothering

Butler amongst them), presided over b
