§1. Non-Electrical Bodies, that have Electric Fire thrown into [or on] them, will retain it, ’till other Non-electrics, that have less, approach; and then ’tis communicated by a Snap, and becomes equally divided.  
§2. Electrical Fire loves Water, is strongly attracted by it, and they can subsist together.  
3. Air is an Electric per Se, and when dry, will not [readily] conduct the Electrical Fire; it will neither receive it, nor give it to other Bodies; otherwise, no Body surrounded by Air could be electrified positively and negatively: For should it be attempted positively, the Air would immediately take away the Overplus; or negatively, the Air would supply what was wanting.  
4. Water being electrified, the Vapours arising from it will be equally electrified; and floating in the Air, in the Form of Clouds, or otherwise, will retain that Quantity of Electrical Fire, ’till they meet with other Clouds or Bodies not so much electrified; and then will communicate as before mentioned.  
5. Every Particle of Matter electrified is repell’d by every other Particle equally electrified. Thus the Stream of an artificial Fountain, naturally dense and continual, when electrified will separate and spread in Form of a Brush; every Drop endeavouring to recede from every other Drop; but on taking out the Electrical Fire, they close again.  
6. Water being strongly electrified, (as well as when heated by common Fire) rises in Vapours more copiously: the Attraction of Cohesion among it’s Particles being greatly weakned by the opposite Power of Repulsion introduced with the Electrical Fire. And when any Particle is by any Means disengaged, tis immediately repell’d and so flies into the Air.  
7. Particles situated as A and B are more easily disengaged than C, and D, as each is held by Contact with three only; whereas C and D are each in Contact with nine. When the Surface is in Motion, Particles are continually pusht in this Situation.  
8. Friction between a Non-Electric and an Electric per Se, will produce Electrical Fire; not by creating but collecting it: For it is equally diffused in our Walls, Floors, Earth, and the whole Mass of common Matter. Thus the whirling Glass Globe, during it’s Friction against the Cushion draws Fire from the Cushion, the Cushion is supply’d from the Frame of the Machine, that from the Floor on which it stands. Cut off the Communication by thick Glass or Wax, placed under the Cushion, and no Fire can be produced, because it can not be collected.  
9. The Ocean is a Compound of Water a Non-Electric, and Salt an Electric per Se.  
10. When there is a Friction among the Parts near it’s Surface, the Electrical Fire is collected from the Parts below. It is then plainly visible in the Night. It appears at the Stern and in the Wake of every sailing Vessel; every Dash of an Oar shews it, and every Surf and Spray: In Storms, the whole Sea seems on Fire. The detacht Particles of Water, then repelled from the Electrified Surface continually carry off the Fire as it is collected; they rise and form Clouds, and those Clouds are highly electrified, and retain the Fire, ’till they have an Opportunity of communicating it.  
11. The Particles of Water rising in Vapour, attatch themselves to Particles of Air.  
12. The Particles of Air are said to be hard, round, separate and distant from each other; every Particle strongly repelling every other Particle; whereby they recede from each other, as far as common Gravity will permit.  
  
13. The Space between any three Particles equally repelling each other, will be an equilateral Triangle.  
14. In Air comprest, these Triangles are smaller; in rarified Air they are larger.  
15. Common Fire joyned with Air, increases the Repulsion, enlarges the Triangles, and thereby makes the Air specifically lighter. Such Air among denser Air will rise.  
16. Common Fire, as well as Electrical Fire, gives Repulsion to the Particles of Water, and destroys their Attraction of Cohesion; Hence common Fire, as well as electrical Fire assists in raising Vapours.  
17. Particles of Water having no Fire with them, mutually attract each other. Three Particles of cold Water then, being attatcht to the three Particles of a Triangle of Air; would by their mutual Attraction, operating against the Air’s Repulsion, shorten the Sides and lessen the Triangle; whereby that Portion of the Air being made denser, would sink to the Earth with it’s Water, and not rise to contribute to the Formation of a Cloud.  
18. But if every Particle of Water attatching itself to Air, brings with it a Particle of common Fire: the Repulsion of the Air being assisted and strengthned by the Fire, more than obstructed by the mutual Attraction of the Particles of Water, the Triangle dilates, and that Portion of Air becoming rarer and specifically lighter, rises.  
19. If the Particles of Water bring Electrical Fire when they attach themselves to Air, the Repulsion between the Particles of Water electrified, joyns with the natural Repulsion of Air, to force it’s Particles to a greater Distance, whereby the Triangles are dilated, and the Air rises, carrying up with it the Water.  
20. If the Particles of Water bring with them Portions of both Sorts of Fire, the Repulsion of the Particles of Air is still more strengthned and encreased, and the Triangles further enlarged.  
21. One Particle of Air may be surrounded by 12 Particles of Water of equal Size with itself, all in contact with it; and by more added to those.  
22. Particles of Air thus loaded, would be drawn nearer together by the mutual Attraction of the Particles of Water, did not Fire common or electrical assist their Repulsion.  
23. If Air thus loaded be comprest by adverse Winds, or by being driven against Mountains &amp;c. or condensed, by taking away the Fire that assisted it in Expanding, the Triangles, contract, the Air with it’s Water will descend as a Dew: or, if the Water surrounding one Particle of Air, comes in Contact with the Water surrounding another, they coalesce, and form a Drop, and we have Rain.  
24. The Sun supplies, (or seems to supply) common Fire to all Vapours, whether raised from the Earth or Sea.  
25. Those Vapours, which have both common and electrical Fire in them, are better supported in the Air; and may be longer supported than those which have only common Fire in them. For when the Vapours rise into the coldest Regions above the Earth, the Cold will not diminish the Electrical Fire, if it doth the common.  
26. Hence Clouds form’d by Vapours raised from fresh Waters within Land, from growing Vegetables, moist Earth &amp;c. more speedily and easily deposite their Water, having but little Electrical Fire to repel and keep the Particles separate. So that the greatest Part of the Water rais’d from the Land, is let fall on the Land again; and the Winds blowing from the Land to the Sea are dry; there being but little Use for Rain on the Sea; and to rob the Land of it’s Moisture, in Order to rain on the Sea, would not appear reasonable.  
27. But Clouds form’d by Vapours, raised from the Sea, having both Fires, and particularly a great Quantity of the Electrical, support their Water Strongly, raise it high; and, being moved by the Winds, may bring it over the Middle of the broadest Continent, from the Middle of the widest Ocean.  
28. How these Ocean Clouds, so strongly supporting their Water, are made to deposite it on the Land, where ’tis wanted, is next to be considered.  
29. If they are driven by Winds against Mountains, those Mountains being less electrified attract them; and on Contact, take away their Electrical Fire (and being cold their common Fire also). Hence the Particles close towards the Mountains and towards each other. If the Air was not much loaded, it only falls in Dews on the Mountain Tops and Sides, forms Springs, and descends to the Vales in Rivulets, which united make larger Streams and Rivers. If much loaded, the Electrical Fire is at once taken from the whole Cloud, and in leaving it, flashes brightly and cracks loudly; The Particles instantly coalescing for Want of that Fire, and falling in a heavy Shower.  
30. When a Ridge of Mountains thus dams the Clouds, and draws the Electrical Fire from the Cloud first approaching it; That which next follows, when it comes near the first Cloud now deprived of it’s Fire, flashes into it, and begins to deposite it’s own Water: The first Cloud again flashing into the Mountains. The third approaching Cloud, and all the succeeding ones, acting in the same Manner as far back as they extend, which may be over many hundred Miles of Country.  
31. Hence the continual Storms of Rain, Thunder and Lightning on the East Side of the Andes, which running North and South, and being vastly high, intercept all the Clouds brought against them from the Atlantic Ocean, by the Trade Winds, and oblige them to deposite their Water: By which the vast Rivers Amazones, La Plata and Oroonoko are form’d, which return the Water again into the same Sea, after it has fertilized a Country of very great Extent.  
32. If a Country be plain, having no Mountains to intercept the electrified Clouds, yet it is not without Means to make them deposite their Water. For if an electrified Cloud, coming from the Sea, meets in the Air a Cloud raised from the Land, and therefore not electrified; the first will flash it’s Fire into the latter, and thereby both Clouds shall be made suddenly to deposite Water.  
33. The electrified Particles of the first Cloud, close when they lose their Fire: the Particles of the other Cloud close in receiving it: in both they have thereby an Opportunity of Coalescing into Drops. The Concussion, or Jerk, given to the Air, contributes also to shake down the Water; not only from those two Clouds but from others near them. Hence the sudden Fall of Rain immediately after a Flash of Lightning.  
34. To shew this by an easy Experiment. Take two round Pieces of Pastboard, two Inches diameter: from the Center and Circumference of each of them, suspend by fine silk Threads, 18 Inches long, 7 small Balls of Wood (or 7 Peas) equal in Bigness: so will the Balls appending to each Pastboard form equal equilateral Triangles, one Ball being in the Center, and six at equal Distances from that and from each other; and thus they represent Particles of Air. Dip both Sets in Water, and some cohering to each Ball, they will represent Air loaded. Dextrously electrify one Sett, and it’s Balls will repel each other to a greater Distance, enlarging the Triangles. Could the Water, supported by the seven Balls, come into Contact, ’twould form a Drop or Drops so heavy as to break the Cohesion it had with the Balls, and so fall. Let the two Sets of Balls then represent two Clouds, the one a Sea Cloud electrified, the other a Land Cloud. Bring them within the Sphere of Attraction, and they will draw towards each other, and you will see the separated Balls close thus; The first electrified Ball that comes near an unelectrified Ball by Attraction, joyns it, and gives it Fire; instantly they separate, and each flies to another Ball of it’s own Party, one to give and the other to receive Fire, and so it proceeds thro both Sets, but so quick as to be in a Manner instantaneous. In the Collision they shake off and drop their Water which represents Rain.  
35. Thus when Sea and Land Clouds would pass at too great a Distance for the Flash, they are attracted towards each other ’till within that Distance: For the Sphere of electrical Attraction is far beyond the Distance of Flashing.  
36. When a great Number of Clouds from the Sea, meet a Number of Clouds raised from the Land, the Electrical Flashes appear to Strike in different Parts; and as the Clouds are jostled and mixed by the Winds, or brought near by the Electrical Attraction, they continue to give and receive Flash after Flash, till the Electrical Fire is equally diffused.  
37. When the Gun Barrel, in Electrical Experiments, has but little Electrical Fire in it, you must approach it very near with your knuckle, before you can draw a Spark. Give it more Fire, and it will give a Spark at a greater Distance. Two Gun Barrels united, and as highly electrified, will give a Spark at a still greater Distance. But if two Gun Barrels electrified will strike at two Inches Distance, and make a loud Snap; to what a great Distance may 10,000 Acres of Electrified Cloud strike and give its Fire, and how loud must be that Crack!  
38. It is a common Thing to see Clouds, at different Heights, passing different Ways, which shews different Currents of Air, one under the other. As the Air between the Tropics is rarified by the Sun, it rises, the denser Northern and Southern Air pressing into it’s Place. The Air so rarified and forced up, passes Northward and Southward, and must descend in the Polar Regions, if it has no Opportunity before, that the Circulation may be carried on.  
39. As Currents of Air, with the Clouds therein, pass different Ways, ’tis easy to conceive, how the Clouds passing over each other, may attract each other, and so come near enough for the electrical Stroke; and also how Electrical Clouds may be carried within Land very far from the Sea, before they have an Opportunity to strike.  
40. When the Air, with it’s Vapours raised from the Oceans between the Tropicks comes to descend in the Polar Regions, and to be in Contact with the Vapours arising there: the Electrical Fire they brought begins to be communicated, and is seen in clear Nights, being first visible where it is first in Motion, that is, where the Contact begins, or in the most Northern Part; from thence the Streams of Light seem to shoot Southerly, even up to the Zenith of Northern Countries. But tho’ the Light seems to shoot from the North Southerly, the Progress of the Fire is really from the South Northerly; it’s Motion begining in the North being the Reason that it is there first seen.  
For the Electrical Fire is never visible but when in Motion, and leaping from Body to Body; or from Particle to Particle thro’ the Air. When it passes through dense Bodies ’tis unseen. When a Wire makes Part of the Circle, in the Explosion of the Electrical Phial, the Fire tho’ in great Quantity, passes in the Wire invisibly. But in passing along a Chain, it becomes visible as it leaps from Link to Link. In passing along Leaf Gold Gilding ’tis visible: For the Leaf Gold is full of Pores. Hold a Leaf to the Light, and it appears like a Net; and the Fire is seen in it’s Leaping over the Vacancies.  
And as when a long Canal fill’d with still Water, is opened at one End in Order to be discharg’d; the Motion of the Water begins first near the opened End, and proceeds towards the close End, tho’ the Water itself moves from the close towards the opened End. So the Electrical Fire discharg’d into the Polar Regions, perhaps from a thousand Leagues Length of vapourized Air, appears first, where tis first in Motion, i.e. in the most Northern Part, and the Appearance proceeds Southward, tho’ the Fire really moves Northward.  
Sometimes the Case may be, that electrified Vapours arising from the Polar Ocean (for Cold is no Hindrance to E

would appear to shoot Northerly, for the Reasons before mentioned.  
Perhaps the Suppositions contained in this Section, may help to account for some of the Phaenomena of the Aurora Borealis.  
41. When there is great Heat on the Land in a particular Region, the Sun having shone on it perhaps several Days, while the Surrounding Countries have been screened by Clouds, the lower Air is rarified and rises, the cooler denser Air above descends; the Clouds in that Air meet from all Sides, and joyn over the heated Place; and if some are electrified, others not, Lightning and Thunder succeed, and Showers fall. Hence Gusts after Heats, and cool Air after Gusts; the Water and the Clouds that bring it, coming from a higher and therefore a cooler Region.  
42. An Electrical Spark drawn from an irregular Body at some Distance is scarce ever strait, but shews crooked and waving in the Air; So do the Flashes of Lightning; the Clouds being very irregular Bodies.  
43. As electrified Clouds pass over a Country, high Hills and high Trees, lofty Towers, Spires, Masts of Ships, Chimneys &amp;c. as so many Prominences and Points, draw the Electrical Fire, and the whole Cloud discharges there.  
44. Dangerous therefore is it to take Shelter under a single Tree during a Thunder Gust. It has been fatal to many, both Men and Beasts.  
45. It is safer to be in the open Field for another Reason. When the Cloaths are wet, if a Flash, in it’s Way to the Ground, should strike your Head, it will run in the Water over the Surface of your Body; whereas if your Cloaths were dry, it would go thro’ the Body.  
Hence a wet Rat can not be kill’d by the exploding Electrical Bottle, when a dry Rat may.  
46. Common Fire [i.e. Culinary] is in all Bodies more or less, as well as Electrical Fire. Perhaps they may be different Modifications of the same Element; Or they may be different Elements. The latter is by some suspected.  
47. If they are different Things, yet they may and do subsist together in the same Body.  
48. When Electrical Fire strikes through a combustible Body, it acts upon the common Fire contain’d in it, and puts that Fire in Motion; and if there be a sufficient Quantity of each Kind of Fire, the Body will be enflamed.  
49. When the Quantity of common Fire in the Body is small, the Quantity of electrical Fire, or the Electrical Stroke, should be greater: If the Quantity of common Fire be great, less Electrical Fire suffices, to produce the Effect.  
50. Thus Spirits must be heated before we can fire them by the Electrical Spark. If they are much heated, a small Spark will do; if not the Spark must be greater.  
51. ’Till lately we could only fire warm Vapours, bu

tation to the common Fire contained in it, as Friction we know will do.  
52. Sulphureous and inflammable Vapours arising from the Earth are easily kindled by Lightning. Besides what arise from the Earth, such Vapours are sent out by Stacks of moist Hay, Corn or other Vegetables, which heat and reek. Wood rotting in old Trees or Buildings does the same: such therefore are easily and often fired.  
53. Metals are often melted by Lightning; tho’ perhaps, not from Heat in the Lightning nor altogether from agitated Fire in the Metals.  
For as whatever Body can insinuate itself between the Particles of Metal, and overcome the Attraction by which they cohere (as sundry Menstrua can) will make the solid become a Fluid, as well as Fire, yet without heating it: So the Electrical Fire, or Lightning, creating a violent Repulsion between the Particles of the Metal it passes thro’, the Metal is fused.  
54. If you would by a violent Fire melt off the End of a Nail which is half driven into a Door; the Heat given the whole Nail before a Part would melt, must burn the Board it sticks in; and the melted Part would burn the Floor it dropt on. But if a Sword can be melted in the Scabbard, and Money in a Mans Pocket, by Lightning, without burning either; it must be a cold Fusion.  
55. Lightning rends some Bodies. The Electrical Spark will strike a Hole thro’ a Quire of strong Paper.  
56. If the foregoing Hypothesis be a true one there ought to be but little Thunder and Lightning far at Sea, or in the Islands remote from the Continent. On Enquiry, the Writer has been informed by an old Sea Captain, that they seldom meet with it on the great Ocean, till they come into Soundings. And an intelligent Person, who lived 13 Years at Bermudas, and many Years at South Carolina, says, That he has ob

dcr the other. As the air be¬  
tween’ the tropics is rarified by  
the fun, it rifes, the denfcr  
northern and fouthern air pref-  
fmg into its place. The air fo  
ratified and forced up, paffes  
northward and fouthward, and  
niuft defeend in, the polar re¬  
gions, if it has no opportunity  
before, that the circulation may  
be carried on.  
  
As currents of air, with the  
clouds therein, pafs different  
ways, it is eafy to conceive how  
the clouds, paffing over each o-  
ther may attradi each other, and  
fo come near enough for the e-  
le^lrical ilroke. And alfo how  
ele^Strical clouds may l&gt;e carried  
within land very far from the  
fea before they have an oppor¬  
tunity to llrike.  
  
When the air, with its va¬  
pours raifed from the ocean be¬  
tween the tropicks comes to  
defeend in the polar regions,  
and to be in contact with the  
.vapours ^rifing there, the elec¬  
trical fire they brought begins  
to be communicated, and is  
feen in clear, nights, being fird  
vifible where ’tis fifil in motion,  
that is, w&#x27;here the contact be¬  
gins, or in the moll northern  
part; from thence the dreams  
of light feem to fhoot fontherly,  
even up to the zenith ot nor¬  
thern countries. But though the  
light fecins to fhoot from the  
north foutherly, tlie progrefs of  
the fire is really from the fouth  
northerly, its motion beginning  
in the nortli being the realon  
that it is there firll ieen.  
  
For  
  
A P R  
  
&#x27; For the eleftrical fire is ne¬  
ver vifible but when in motion,  
and leaping from body to body,  
or from particle to particle thro’  
the air. When it paflcs thro*  
denfe bodies it is unfeen. When  
a wire makes part of the circle,  
in the explofion of the ele»!ilri-  
cal phial, the fire,- tho’ in great  
quantity, pafles in the wire in-  
vifible : but in paffing along a  
chain, it becomes vifible as it  
leaps from link to link. In  
palling along leaf-guilding it is  
vifible ; for the leaf-gold is full  
of pores ; hold a leaf to the  
light and it appears like a net;  
and the fire is leen in its leaping  
over the vacancies. — And as  
when a long canal filled with  
Hill water is opened at one end,  
in order to be difcharged, the  
motion of the water begins full  
near the opened end, and pro¬  
ceeds towards the clofe end,  
though the water itfelf moves  
from the clofe towards the open

This is fuppofed to account for  
the Aurora Borealis.  
  
When.there is great heat on  
the land, in a particular region  
(the fun having fhone on it per¬  
haps feveral days, while the fur¬  
rounding countries have been  
fereen’d by clouds) the lower  
air is rarified and rifes, the  
  
I L, 1751.&#x27; 199  
  
cooler denfer air above de-  
feends; the clouds in th.at air  
meet from all fides, and join o-  
ver the heated place; and if  
fome are eledrified, others not,  
lightening and thunder fucceed,  
and fhowers fall. Hence thun¬  
der gulls after heats, and cool air  
after gulls; the w^ater and the  
clouds that bring it, coming  
from a higher and therefore a  
cooler region.  
  
As cledrified clouds pafs over  
a country, high hills and high  
trees, lofty tow&#x27;ers, fpires, malls  
of Ihips, chimneys. Sec. as fo  
many prominences and points,  
draw the eledrical fire, and the  
whole cloud difeharges there.  
  
Dangerous, therefore, it is to  
take Ihelter under a tree during  
a thunder-gull. It has been fa¬  
tal to many, both men and  
beads.  
  
It is fafer to be in the open  
field for another rcafon. When  
the clothes are wet, if a flalh  
in its way to the ground Ihould  
llrike your head, it will run in  
the water over the furfiice of  
your body ; whereas, if your  
clothes were dry, it would go  
through the body.  
  
Hence a wet rat cannot be  
killed by the exploding elec¬  
trical bottle, when a dry rat  
may.  
  
■ Common fire is in all bodies,  
more or lefs, as w&#x27;ell&#x27; as eledri¬  
cal fire. Perhaps they may be  
different modifications of the  
fame element ; or they may be  
different elements. 1&#x27;he latter  
is by fome fufpeded.  
  
If they, are different things^

oar fhows it, and every and {pray :  
in ftorms the whole fea feems on fire.—  
The detach’d particles.of water then  
repelled from the electrified furface, con-  
tinually carry off the fire as it is collec-  
ted ; they rife and form clouds, and thofe  
clouds are highly eleétrified, and retain  
the fire *till they have an opportunity of  
communicating it.  
  
The particles of water rifing in va-  
pours, attach themfelves to particles. of  
air. One particle of air may be furround-  
ed by twelve perciaise of water of equal  
fize with itfelf,  
and by more added to thofe.-—This our  
author proves by experiment.  
  
Particles of air thus loaded would be  
drawn nearer together by the mutual  
attraction of the particles of water, did

vapours rife into the coldeft ‘region as  
bove the earth, the cold will not di:  
miriifh the eleétrical fire if it does “the  
  
Cc common.  
  
Hence clouds formed by va

from growing gyorg moift earth,  
&amp;c. more {peedily and eafily depofite  
their water, having but Vittle electrical

HE Ocean is a compound of  
Water, a Nomelefirick, and Salt,  
  
an Eleétric per /e.  
When there is a Friftion among the  
Parts near its Surface, the eleétrical F ire  
is collected from the Parts below. Te is  
  
then plainly vifible in the Night; it ap-  
hl 2 pears  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
240  
pears at the Stérn and in the Wake of  
every failing Veffel; every Dafh of an  
Oar fhows it, and every Surff and Spray :  
In Storms the whole Sea feems on Fire.  
—The detach’d Particles of Water then  
repelled from the electrified Surface,  
continually carry off the Fire as it is  
colledied ; they rife and form Clouds,  
and thofe Clouds are highly elettrified,  
and retain the Fire till they have an  
Opportunity of communicating it.  
  
‘Lhe Particles of Water rifing in Va-  
pours,  
  
Air. One Particle of Air may be fur.  
  
rounded by twelve Particles of Water of  
  
equal Size with itfelf, all in Contact with  
its and by more.added to thofe.—7 di,  
our Author proves by Experiment.  
  
Particles of Air thus loaded would be  
  
drawn nearer together by the mutual  
Attraction of the Particles of Water, did  
not the Fire, common or elecirical, aflift  
their Repulfion.  
‘ It Air thus loaded be compreffed by  
adverfe Winds, or by being driven a-  
gainft Mountains, &amp;c. or condenfed by  
taking away the Fire that affifted it in  
expanding, the Air with its Water will  
defcend as Dew;- or; if the Water fur-  
rounding one Particle of Air comes in  
Contact with the Water furrounding a-  
nother, they coalefce and form a Drop,  
and we have Rain.  
  
The Sun fupplies (or feems to fupply)  
  
common Fire to all Vapours, whether  
raifed from Earth or Sea.  
’ Thofe Vapours ‘which have both  
common and electrical Fire in them,  
are better fupported, than thole which  
have only common Fite in them. For  
when Vapours rife into the coldeft Region  
above the Earth, the Cold will not di-  
minifh the eleétrical Fire if it does the  
common. !  
  
Hence Clouds formed by Vapours  
raiied from frefh Waters within Land,  
from growing Vegetables, moift Earth,  
&amp;c. more ipeedily and eafily depofite  
their Water,» having but litle eleétrical  
Fire to repel and’ keep the Particles fe-  
parate. So that the greateft Part of the

Clouds formed by Vapours raifed from  
the Sea, having both Fires, and parti.  
cularly a great Quantity of the elettri.  
cal, {upport their Water ftrongly, raife  
it high, and being moved by Winds  
may bring it over the Middle of the  
broadeft Continent from the Middle of  
the wideft Ocean.  
  
How the Ocean Clouds, fo ftrongly  
fupporting their Water, are made to  
depofite it on the Land where ’tis wanted,  
is next to be confidered.  
  
If they are driven by Winds againg  
Mountains, thefe Mountains being lefs  
electrified attraét them, and on Conta&amp;  
take away their ele€tical Fire (and be-  
ing cold) the common Fire alfo ; hence  
the Particles clofe towards the Moun-  
tains and towards each other. Jf the  
Air be not much loaded, it only falls in  
Dews on the Mountain Tops and Sides,  
forms Springs, and defcends to the Vales  
Rivulets, which united make larger  
Sueams and Rivers. If much loaded,  
the electrical Fire is at once taken from  
the whole Cloud; and in leaving tt,  
flafhes brightly and cracks loudly; the  
Particles inftantly coalefcing for Want  
of that Fire, and falling in a heavy  
Shower.  
  
When a Ridge of Mountains thus  
dams the Clouds, and draws the electri-  
cal Fire from the Cloud firft approach-  
ing it; that which next follows, when  
it comes near the firft Cloud, now de-  
prived of its Fire, flafhes into it, and  
begins to depofite its own Watery the

tain, the third approaching Cloud, and  
all the fucceeding ones, aét in the fame

from the Ar/antick Ocean by the Trade  
Winds, oblige them to depofite their  
Waters, by which the-vaft Rivers Ama  
sons, La Plata, and Oroonoko are formed,  
which return the Water into the fame  
Sea, having fertilized a Country of great  
Extent.  
  
If a Country be plain, having no  
Mountains to intercept the electrified  
Clouds, yet is # not without Means to  
make them depofite their Water. For  
if an electrified Cloud coming from the  
Sea, meets in the Air a Cloud raifed  
from the Land, and therefore not elec-  
trifed; the firft will flafh its Fire into  
the latter, and thereby both Clouds fhall  
be made fuddenly to depofire Water.  
  
The eleétrified Particles of the firft  
Cloud clofe when they lofe their Fire ;  
the Particles of the other Cloud clofe in  
receiving it: In both, they have thereby  
an Opportunity of coalefcing into Drops.  
—-The Concuflion or Jerk given to the  
Air, contributes alfo to fhake down the  
Water, not only from thofe two Clouds,  
but from others nearthem. Hence the  
fudden Fall of Rain immediately after  
flafhes of Lightning.  
  
When a great Number of Clouds  
from the Sea meet a Number of C’ouds  
railed from the Land, the electrical  
Flathes appear to ftrike in different Parts ;  
and as the Clouds are joftled and mixed  
by the Winds, or brought near by the  
electrical: Attra&amp;tion,.. they continue to  
  
give and receive Flafh after Flafh,tll the  
  
electrical Fire is equally diffufed.  
  
It is acommon Thing to fee Clouds  
at different Heights pafling different  
Ways, which fhews different Currents  
of Air, one under the other. As the  
Air between the Tropicks is rarefied by  
the Sun, it rifes, the denfer Northern  
and Southern Air preffing into its Place.  
The Air fo rarefied and forced up, paf-  
fes Northward and Southward, and muft  
defcend in the polar Regions, if it bas  
no Opportunity before, that the Circu-  
lation may be carried on.  
  
As Currents of Air, with the Clouds  
therein, pafs different Ways, it is ealy  
  
  
  
241  
  
Stroke. And alfo how electrical Clouds  
may be carried within Land very far  
from the Sea before they have an Op-  
portunity to ftrike.  
  
When the Air, with its Vaponrs raifed  
from the Ocean between the Tropicks,  
comes todefcend in the polar Regions,  
and to be in Contact with the Vapours  
arifing there, the elettrical Fire they  
brought begins to be communicated, and  
is feen in clear Nights, being firtt. vifible  
where ‘tis firft in Motion, that is, where  
the Contact begins, or in the moit north-  
ern Part; from thence the Streams of  
Ligh: feem to fhoot foutherly, even up  
to the Zenith of northern Countries. But  
tho’ the Light feems to fhoot from the  
North foutherly, the Progrefs of the Fire  
is really from the South northerly, its  
Motion beginning in the North being  
the Reafon that it is there firft feen. As  
when a long Canal filled with ftill Wa-  
ter is opened at one End, the Motion  
of the Water begins firft near the opened  
End, and proceeds towards the clofe  
End, though the Water itfelf moves from  
the clofe towards the open End. Thi

3s fuppofed to account for the 4urora  
  
Borealis. ,  
  
When there is great Heat on the  
Land, in a particular Region, (the Sun  
having fhone on it feveral Days, while  
the furrounded Countries: have been  
fcreen’d by Clouds) the lower Air is ra-  
refied and rifes, the cooler denfé Air  
above defcends; the Clouds in-that Air  
meet from all Sides, and join over the  
heated Place; and if fome are eleétri-  
fied, others not, Lightening and. Thun-  
der fucceed, and Showers fall. . Hence  
Thunder gufts after Heats, and cool  
Air after Gufts; the Water and the  
Clouds that bring it, coming from a  
higher and therefore a cooler Region.  
  
As ele&amp;trified Clouds pafs over a Coun-  
try, high Hills and high Trees, lofty  
Towers, Spires, Mafts of Ships, Chim-  
neys, &amp;c, as fo many Prominenees and  
  
Points,  
  
  
  
  
  
242  
  
Points, draw the eleétrical Fire, and  
the whole Cloud difcharges there.  
  
Dangerous, therefore, it is to take  
Shelter under a ‘I&#x27;ree during a Thunder-  
guft. It is fafer to be in the open Field  
for another Reafon. When the Cloaths  
are wet, if a Flafh in its Way to the  
Ground fhould ftrike your Head, it will  
run in the Water over the Surface of  
your Body; whereas, if your Cloaths  
were dry, it would go through the  
Body. Hence a wet Rat cannot be  
killed by the exploding eleétrical Bottle,  
when.a dry Rat may.  
  
When theelettrical Fire ftrikes through  
a Body, it aéts upon the common Fire  
contained ia it, and puts that Fire in  
Motion; and if there be a fufficient  
Quantity of each Kind of Fire, the Body  
will be inflamed.

Metals are often melted by Lighten-

Lightening, nor aliogether from agitated  
Fire in the Metals.—For as whatever  
Body can infinuate itfelf between the  
Particles of Metal, and overcome the  
Attraction by which they cohere, (as  
fundry Menftrua can) will make the So-  
lid become a Fluid, as well as Fire, yet

being made denfer, would fink to the earth with its water, and:  
not rife to.contribute to the formation of a cloud.  
  
18. That, on the contrary,. if every particle of water at+  
taching itfelf to air, brings with it a particle of common fire,  
the repulfion of the air being affifted and ftrengthened by the  
fire, more than obftructed by the mutual attraction of the  
particles of water, the triangledilates, and that portion of air

19. That if the particles of water bring electrical fire when:  
they attach themfelves to air, the repulfion between the par-:

air, to force its particles to a greater diftance; whereby the  
triangles are dilated, and the air rifes, carrying up with it the  
water.

or by being driven againft mountains, &amp;c. or condenfed  
by taking away the fire that affifted in its expanding, the tri-  
angles contract, the air, with its water, will defcend as a dew;  
or if the water furrounding one particle of air comes in con-  
tact with the water furrounding another, they coalefce and

electrical fire to repel and keep the particles feparate; fo that  
the greateft part of the water raifed from the land, is let fall  
on the land again, and winds blowing from the land to the  
fea are dry-  
  
27. That, on the contrary, clouds formed by vapours raifed  
from the fea, having both fires, and particularly a great quan-  
tity of the electrical, fupport their water ftrongly, raife it  
high, and, being moved by winds, may bring it over the  
middle of the broadeft continent, from the middie of the  
wideft ocean.  
  
28. That if thefe clouds are driven by winds againft moun-  
tains, thefe mountains, being lefs electrified, attraé&amp; them,  
and on contact take away their electrical fire (and being cold,  
the common fire alfo:) hence the particles clofe towards the  
mountains, and towards each other. If the air was not much  
loaded, it only falls in dews on the mountain-tops and fides,  
forms fprings, and defcends to the vales in rivulets, which  
  
united, make larger ftreams and rivers. If much loaded, the  
electrical fire is at once taken from the whole cloud; and im  
leaving it, flafhes brightly, and cracks loudly; the particles  
inftantly coalefcing for want of that fire, and falling in a hea-  
vy fhower. .  
  
29. That when a ridge of mountains thus dams the clouds,  
and draws the eleétrical fire from the cloud firft approaching  
it, that which next follows, when it comes near the firft cloud,  
now deprived of its fire, flafhes into it, and begins to depo-  
fite its own water; the fir(t cloud again flafhing into the moun-  
tains; the third approaching cloud, and all the fucceeding  
ones, ating in the fame manner as far back as th:y extend,  
which may be ever many hundred miles of country.  
  
30. Hence the continual ftorms of rain, thunier, and lighten-  
ing in the eaft fide of the Andes, which running north and  
fouth, and being vaftly high, intercept all the clouds brought  
again{ft them from the Atlantic ocean by the trade winds, and  
oblige them to depofite their waters; by which the vatt ri-  
versAmazons, La Plata, Oroonoko are formed, which return the  
water into the fame fea, after having fertilized a country of  
yery great extent.  
  
31. That if a country be plain, having no mountains to in-  
tercept the electrified clouds, yet it is not without means to  
make them depofite their water. For if an eleétrified cloud  
coming from the fea, meets in the air a cloud raifed from the  
land, and therefore not electrified, the firft will! flath its fire  
into the latter, and thereby each cloud will depofite its water.

108 The MONTHLY REVIEW,  
  
32. That the electrified particles of the firft cloud clofe  
when they have loft their fire ; the particles of the other cloud  
clofe in receiving it: in both they have an ‘opportunity of  
coalefcing into drops. — T he concuflion given to the air con-  
tributes alfo to fhake down the water, not only from thofe  
two clouds, but from others near them. Hence the fudden  
fall of rain &quot;immediately after flafhes of lightning.—This our  
author has confirmed by the following experiment.  
  
‘ Take, fays he, two round pieces of pafteboard, two in-  
chesdiameter ;. from the center and circumference of each of  
them fufpend, by fine filk threads, eighteen inches long, fe-  
ven fmall balls of wood, or feven peas, equal in-bignefs ; fo  
will the balls appending to each pafteboard, form equil..teral  
triangles, one ball being in the center, and fix at equal diftan-  
ces from that,. and from each other ; and thus they reprefent  
particles of air. Dip both fets in water, and fomecohering to  
each ball, they will reprefent air loaded. Dexteroufly ele€trify  
one fet, and its balls will repel each other to a greater dif-  
tance, enlarging the triangles. Could the water, fupport-  
ed by the feven balls, come into contact, it would form a drop  
or drops fo heavy as to break the cohefion it had with the  
balls, and fo fall.— Let the two fets then reprefent-twoclouds,  
the one a fea-cloud eleétrified, the other a land-cloud. - Bring  
them within the fphere of attraction, and they will draw  
towards each other, and you will fee the feparated balls clofe  
thus; the firft electrified ball that comes near an unelec-  
trified ball by attraction, joins it, and gives it fire; inftantly  
they feparate, and each flies to another ball of its own party,  
one to give and the other to receive fire ; and fo it proceeds  
through both fets, but fo quick as to be in a manner inftan-  
tancous. In the collifion they fhake off and drop their wa-  
ter, which reprefents rain.  
  
34. That ot when fea and bial, clouds would pafs at too  
creat a diftance for the flafh, they are attracted towards each  
ether till within that diftance ; ; the fphere of elcétrical attrac-  
tion being far beyond the diftance of flafhine.  
  
35. That when a great number of clouds from the fea  
meet a number of clouds raifed from the sand, the eletrical  
flathes appear to ttrike in different parts; and as the clouds  
are joftled and mixed by the wiads, or brought near by the  
electrical attra€tion, they continue ‘to give arid receive flafh  
after flafh, till the electrical fire is equally diffufed.

in it, you mutt approach it very near before you can draw off

a fpark. Give it more fire, it will give a fpark at a greater  
diftance. Two gun-barfels united, and as highly electrified,  
will give a {park at a ftill greater diftance. But if two gun-  
barrels electrified will trike at two inches diftance, and make  
a loud f{nap, to what a great diftance may 10,000 acres of  
electrified cloud ftrike and give its fire, and how loud muft be  
that crack ! ;  
  
37. That it is a common thing to fee clouds at different  
heights paffing different ways, which fhows different currents  
of air, one under the other. As the air between the tropics  
is rarified by the fun, it rifes, the denfer northern and fouthera  
air prefling into its place. The air fo rarified and forced up,  
pafles northward and fouthward, and muft defvend in the polar  
regions, if it has no oppertunity before, that the circulation  
may be carried on.  
  
38. That as currents of air, wich the clouds therein, pals  
different ways, it is eafy to conceive how the clouds pafling  
over each other, may attract.each other, and fo come near  
enough for the eleétrical ftroke.. And alfohowelectrical clouds  
may be carried within land very far from the fea, before they  
have an opportunity to ftrike. |  
  
39. That when the air, with its vapours raifed from the  
ocean between the tropics, comes to defcend in the polar re-  
gions, and be in contact with the vapours ariling there, the  
electrical fire they brought begins to be communicated, and -  
is feen in clear nights, being firft vifible where it is firft in  
motion; that is, where the contact begins, or in the moft nor-  
thern part; from thence the ftreams of light feem to fhoot  
foutherly, even up to the zenith of northern countries. But  
tho’ the light feems to fhoot from the north foutherly, the  
progrefs of the fire is really from the fouth northerly, its mo-  
tion beginning in the north being the reafon it is there fark  
feen. Upon this principle the author accounts for the aurora  
borealis. : Spe  
  
40. That when there is a great heat on the land, in a par-  
ticular region, the lower air is rarified and rifes, the cooler  
air above defcends ; the clouds in that air meet from all fides,  
and join over the heated place; and if fome are electrified,  
ethers not, lightning and thunder fuccced, and fhowers fall.  
Hence thunder-gufts after heats, and cool air after gufts: the  
water and the clouds that bring it, coming from a higher and  
therefore a cooler region. | | i

waving in the air. So do the flathes of lightning, the clouds  
being very irregular bodies.  
  
42. That as eleCtrified clouds pafs over a country, high hills  
and high trees, lofty towers, fpires, mafts of fhips, chimneys,  
&amp;¢. as fo many prominences and points, draw the electrical  
fire, and the whole cloud difcharges there.  
  
43- That it is therefore dangerous to take fhelter under a  
tree during a thunder-guft.  
  
44. That it is fafer to be in the open field for another rea-  
fon. When the cloaths are wet, if a flafh in its way fhould  
ftrike your head, it will run in the water over the furface of  
your body ; whereas, if your cloaths were dry, it would  
through your body. Hence ajwet rat cannot be killed by the  
exploding eleétrical bottle, when a dry one may.  
  
45. That common fire is in all bodies more or lefs, as well  
as ele&amp;trical fire. Perhaps they may be different modifica-  
tions of the fame element ; or they may be different elements:  
  
46. That if they are different things, yet they may and do  
fubfift together in the fame body.  
  
47. That when an eleétrical fire ftrikes thro’ a body, it  
aéts upon the common fire contained in it, and puts that fite  
im motion ; and if there be a fufficient cuantity of each kind  
of fire, the body will be inflamed.  
  
48, That when the quantity of common fire in the body is  
fmall, the quantity of the electrical fire (or the ele€trical ftroke)  
fhould be greater: if the quantity of common fire be great,  
lefs eleétrical fire fuffices to produce the effect.  
  
49. That fulphureous and inflammable vapours arifing from  
the earth, are eafily kindled by lightning. Befides what arife  
from the earth, fuch vapours are fent out by ftacks of moift  
hay, corn, or other vegetables, which heat and reek. Wood  
rotting in old trees or buildings does the fame. Such are there  
fore eafily and often fired.  
  
50. That metals are often melted by lightning, tho’ perhaps  
not from heat in the lightning, nor altogether from agitated  
fire in the metals ——~For as whatever body can infinuate itfelf  
between the particles of metal, and overcome the attraétion  
by which they cohere (as fundry menftrua can) will make the  
folid become a fluid, as well as fire, yet without heating it:  
_ fo the ele@trical fire or lightning, creating a violent repulfion  
between the particles of the metal it pafles through, the metal  
is fufed. | “.

been attended with various sounds of  
rumbling and hissing. Mr. Stanton, a  
very learned and strict observer, soon after  
he had obtained electricity from the clouds  
offered an opinion that the Aurora Boreal­  
is is occasioned by the dashing of electric  
fire from positive clouds at a great dis­  
tance, through the upper part of the at­  
mostphcre where the resistance is least.  
Doctor Franklin supposed, that the elec­  
trical fire discharged into the polar re­  
gions from many leagues of vaporised air  
raised from the ocean between the tropics,  
accounts for the Aurora Borealis, and  
that it appears first where it is first in  
motion, namely, in the most northern part,  
and the appearance proceeds southward,  
though the fire really moves northwar

1749, Franklin said: “For, if an electrified cloud, coming from  
the sea, meets in the air a cloud raised from the land, and there-  
fore not electrified, the first will flash its fire into the latter, and  
thereby both clouds shall be made suddenly to deposit water.
