The following remarkable little poem is a contribution to the San Francisco Times, from the pen of Mrs. H. A. Deming. The reader will notice that each line is a quotation from some one of the standard authors of England and America. This is the result of a year&#x27;s laborious search among the voluminous writings of thirty-eight leading poets of the past and present. The number of each line refers to the author below:  
  
LIFE.  
  
1—Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
2—Life&#x27;s a short summer, man a flower;  
  
3—By turns we catch the vital breath and die—  
4—The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh.  
  
5—To be is better far than not to be,  
6—Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a tragedy;  
  
7—But light cares speak when mighty griefs are dumb,  
8—The bottom is but shallow when they come.  
  
9—Your fate is but the common fate of all;  
10—Unmingled joys, here, to no man befall,  
  
11—Nature to each allots his proper sphere,  
12—Fortune makes folly her peculiar care;  
  
13—Custom does not often reason overrule,  
14—And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
  
15—Live well, how long or short permit to heaven.  
16—They who forgive most, shall be most forgiven.  
  
17—Sin may be clasped so close we cannot see its face—  
18—Vile intercourse where virtue has no place;  
  
19—Then keep each passion down, however dear,  
20—Thou pendulum, betwixt a smile and tear;  
  
21—Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasures lay,  
22—With craft and skill, to ruin and betray;  
  
23—Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise,  
24—We masters grow of all that we despise.  
  
25—O, then, renounce that impious self-esteem;  
26—Riches have, wings, and grandeur is a dream.  
  
27—Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tis brave,  
28—The paths of glory lead but to the grave.  
  
29—What is ambition?—&#x27;tis a glorious cheat!—  
30—Only destructive to the brave and great.  
  
31—What&#x27;s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
32—The way to bliss lies not on beds of down.  
  
33—How long we live, not years, but actions, tell;  
34—That man lives twice who lives the first life well.  
  
35—Make, then, while yet we may, your God your friend.  
36—Whom Christians worship, yet not comprehend.  
  
37—The trust that&#x27;s given guard; and to yourself be just;  
38—For, live we how we can, yet die we must.

The following remarkable little poem  
is a contribution to the San Francisco  
Times, from the pen of Mr. H. A. Dein­  
ing. The readers will notice that each  
line is a quotation from some one of the  
standard authors of England and Amer­  
ica. This is the result of a year&#x27;s labo­  
rious search anions: the voluminous writ  
ings of thirty-eight leading poets of the  
past and present. The number of each  
line refers to the author below :  
Life.  
1 Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
a Life&#x27;s a short summer, a man ft flowery  
8 By turns wo catch the vital breath and die  
4 The cradle and the tomb, alas1, so nigh.  
6 To be Is better for than not to be,  
6 Thougb all man&#x27;s lite may seem a tragedy;  
7 But light cares speak when mighty griefs are  
dumb,  
6 The bottom ia but shallow whence they come.  
ft Your fat is but the common fate of all)  
10 Unraingled joys, here, to no man befalL  
11 Nature to each allots his proper sphere,  
12 Fortune makes folly her peculiar care;  
13 Custom does not often reason overrule,  
14 And throw a cruel siuisnin3 on a fool;  
15 Live well, how long or short permit, to heaven,  
16 They who forget most shall be most forgiven.  
17 Sin may be clasped so close we cannot see hU  
face  
18 Vilt intercourse where virtue has not place;  
19 Then keep each passion down, however dear,  
20 Thou Pendulum betwixt a smile and tear;  
21 Her seimtnl sneer?, let faithless pleasure lav.  
22 With emit and skill to ruiu and betray;  
23 Soar not to high to fill, but stoop to rise,  
24 We masters grow of all we most despite.  
25 O, then renounce that impious self-esteem;  
2ti Riches have wings and grandeur w a dream.  
27 Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tis brave,  
28 The path of glory lead but to the grave.  
29 What is ambition? tis a glorious cheat,  
86 Only destructive to the brave and great.  
81 Whnts all the gaudy glitters of a crown?  
82 The way to bliss lies not on beds of down.  
83 How long we live not rears but actions tell;  
84 That men live twice who live the first life well.  
35 Make then, while yet ye may, your God your

LIFE.  
  
1—Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour ?  
  
2—Life’s a short summer, man a flower.  
  
3- 4 turns we catch the vital breath and die—  
  
4—The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh. j  
s--To be, is better far than not to be,  
  
6—Though all man’s life may seem a tragedy ;  
  
7— But light cares speak when mighty griefs are dumb  
8-—The bottom is but shallow whence they come. ‘  
9—Your fate is but the common fate of all;  
1o—Unmingled joys here to no man befall.  
  
s1—Nature to each allots his proper sphere ;  
12—Fortune makes folly her peculiar care ;  
13—Custom does often reason overrule,  
14—And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
  
15—Live well; how long or short, permit to heaven ;  
16—They who forgive most shall be most forgiven.  
17—Sin may be clasped so close that we cannot sec its face ;  
18—Vile intercourse where virtue has no place.  
  
ssion down, however dear;  
  
19—Then keep each f :  
twixt a smile and tear.  
  
20—Thou pendulum  
  
21—Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasures lay ;  
  
2a—With craft and skill, to ruin and betray ;  
  
23—Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to raise,  
  
24—We masters grow of all that we despise.  
  
25—O, then, I r that impi self-esteem ;  
  
26—Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream.  
  
27—Think not ambition’ wise because ‘tis brave,  
  
28—The paths of glory lead but to the grave,  
  
29—What is ambition ?—’tis a glorious cheat !—  
  
30--Only destructive to the brave and great.  
  
31—What&#x27;s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
  
32—The ways of bliss lies not on beds of down.  
  
33—How long we live, not years, but actions tell ;  
  
34—That man lives twice who lives the first life well.  
  
35—Make, then, while yet we may, your God your friend,  
  
36—Whom Christians worship, yet not comprehend.  
  
37 —The trust that’s given guard, and to yourself be just;  
  
38—For, live we how we can, yet die we must.

The following very remarkable little poem is  
a contribution to the San Francisco Times from  
the pen of Mrs. H. A. Dem i ng. The reader will  
see that each line is a quotation from some one  
of the standard authors of England and Amer­

search among the voluminous writings of thir­  
ty-eight leading poets of tbe past and present.  
The number of each line refers to its author be­  
low:

The names of the authors are given below:  
1—Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
2—Life&#x27;s a short summer, man a flower.  
3—By turns we catch the vital breath and die,  
4—The cradle and the tomb, alas! so nigh.  
5—To be is better far than not to be,  
6~&#x27;Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a tragedy  
7—But light cares speak when mighty cares  
are dumb,  
8—The bottom is but shallow whence they  
come.  
9—Your fate is but the common fate of all  
10—Unmingled joys here to no man befall.  
11—Nature to each allots his proper sphere,  
12—Fortune makes folly her peculiar care  
13—Custom does often reason overrule,  
14—And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
15—Live well, how long or short, permit tc  
heaven.  
16—They  
who forgive most shall be most for­  
given.  
17—Sin may be clasped so close we can not see  
its face—  
18—Vile intercourse where virtue has not place  
19—Then keep each passion down, however  
dear  
20—Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear  
21—Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasure  
lay  
22—With  
craft and skill to ruin and betray  
23—Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise.  
24—We masters grow of all that we despise.  
25—O, then renounce that impious self-esteem •,  
26—Riches have wings, and grandeur is a  
dream.  
27—Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tis brave,  
28—The path of glory leads but to the grave.  
29—What is ambition &#x27;Tis a glorious cheat,

The following remarkable little poem is  
a contribution to the San Francisco Times  
from the pen of H. A. Doming. The  
reader will see that each line is a quota­  
tion from someone of the standard auth­  
ors of England and America. This is the  
result of years of laborious writings of 38  
leading poets of the past and present.  
The number of each refers to its author  
below.  
1. W&#x27; y all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
2. Life&#x27;s a short summer, man’s a flower.

7. But light cares speak when mighty griefs  
are dumb.

come.
