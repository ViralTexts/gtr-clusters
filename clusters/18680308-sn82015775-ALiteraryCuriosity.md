The following remarkable little poem is a contribution to the San Francisco Times, from the pen of Mrs. H. A. Deming. The reader will notice that each line is a quotation from some one of the standard authors of England and America. This is the result of a year&#x27;s laborious search among the voluminous writings of thirty-eight leading poets of the past and present. The number of each line refers to the author below:  
  
LIFE.  
  
1—Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
2—Life&#x27;s a short summer, man a flower;  
  
3—By turns we catch the vital breath and die—  
4—The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh.  
  
5—To be is better far than not to be,  
6—Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a tragedy;  
  
7—But light cares speak when mighty griefs are dumb,  
8—The bottom is but shallow when they come.  
  
9—Your fate is but the common fate of all;  
10—Unmingled joys, here, to no man befall,  
  
11—Nature to each allots his proper sphere,  
12—Fortune makes folly her peculiar care;  
  
13—Custom does not often reason overrule,  
14—And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
  
15—Live well, how long or short permit to heaven.  
16—They who forgive most, shall be most forgiven.  
  
17—Sin may be clasped so close we cannot see its face—  
18—Vile intercourse where virtue has no place;  
  
19—Then keep each passion down, however dear,  
20—Thou pendulum, betwixt a smile and tear;  
  
21—Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasures lay,  
22—With craft and skill, to ruin and betray;  
  
23—Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise,  
24—We masters grow of all that we despise.  
  
25—O, then, renounce that impious self-esteem;  
26—Riches have, wings, and grandeur is a dream.  
  
27—Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tis brave,  
28—The paths of glory lead but to the grave.  
  
29—What is ambition?—&#x27;tis a glorious cheat!—  
30—Only destructive to the brave and great.  
  
31—What&#x27;s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
32—The way to bliss lies not on beds of down.  
  
33—How long we live, not years, but actions, tell;  
34—That man lives twice who lives the first life well.  
  
35—Make, then, while yet we may, your God your friend.  
36—Whom Christians worship, yet not comprehend.  
  
37—The trust that&#x27;s given guard; and to yourself be just;

A Literary Curiosity,  
The following remarkable little poem  
is a contribution to the San Francisco  
Times, from the pen of Mr. H. A. Dein­  
ing. The readers will notice that each  
line is a quotation from some one of the  
standard authors of England and Amer­

rious search anions: the voluminous writ

SueeaeGe.  The offects of lowering  
the standard of American suffrage are  
st strikingly to be observed in what is  
taking place in California. There are  
now said to be over 130,000 Chinese on  
he Pacific slope, a large portion of whom.  
under the new or der of affairs, will be en­  
titled to vote and make laws. In addi­  
tion to this, a late msil informs us of the  
earrival of a number of Japanese in the  
Golden State, and of the fact thatea large  
future immigration of this race is antici­  
pated. Some day or other, this  
e ment of the races will excite alarm, and  
perhaps lead to bloodshed. So much for

&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t marry the best man that  
ever lived!&quot;  
And she meant it, or, what answers  
the same purpose, she thought she  
meant it. After all, how few of us ever  
really know what we do mean?  
&quot;a engaged myself once when a girl,  
and the simpleton thought he owned  
me.. I soon took that conceit out of  
himj and sent him about his business.&quot;  
The voice was now a trifle sharp.  
What wonder, with so galling a mem­  
ory?No man shall ever tyrannize over  
me-j-never! What the mischief do you  
suppose is the matter with thi3 sewing­  
machine?&quot;&quot; Annoyed at your logic, most like  
ly,&quot; said my friend, a bright-eyed young  
matron, as she threaded her needle.  
My husband is not a tyrant, Miss  
Kent.&quot;  
&quot;lam glad you are satisfied,&quot; was  
ihe laconic answer.  
It was quite evident by the expression  
of the dress-maker&#x27;s face that she had  
formed her own opinion about my  
friend&#x27;s husband, and was quite com  
petent to form and express an opinion  
on any subject.  
v. Miss Kent was a little woman, as fair  
as a girl and as plump as a robin. She  
wasn&#x27;t ashamed to own that she was 40  
years old and an old maid. She had  
earned her own living most of her life,  
aid was proud of it. Laziness was the  
one sin Mi3S Kent could not forgive.  
She was a good nurse, a faithful friend,  
and a jolly companion ; but stroke her  
the wrong way, and you&#x27;d wish you  
hadn&#x27;t in much shorter time than it  
takes me to write it. Her views on all  
subjects were strikingly original, and  
not to be combated.  
&quot;What are you going to do when you  
are oldP&quot; persisted the mistress of the  
establishment.  
&quot;What other old  
folks  
do, I sup  
pose  
&quot;But you can&#x27;t work forever.&quot;  
&quot;Can&#x27;t say that I want to.&quot;  
&quot; Now, Miss Kent, a husband with  
means, a kind, intelligent man &quot;  
&quot;I don&#x27;t want. 1 don&#x27;t want any  
man. I tell you, Mrs. Carlisle, I wouldn&#x27;t  
marry

[Mrs. H. A. DEMING, of San Francisco, is  
said to have occupied a year in hunting up  
and fitting together the following thirty-  
eight lines from thirty-eight English poets.  
The names of the authors are given below.  
How many can place them without referring  
to the key ?]  
&#x27; 1. Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
. Life’s a short summer—man a flower ;  
By turns we catch the vital breath and die.  
  
2  
  
3  
  
4. The cradle and the tomb, alas! so nigh.  
5. To be is better far than not to be,  
6  
rf  
8  
  
  
  
. Though all man’s life may seem a tragedy  
. But light cares speak when mighty griets  
are dumb,  
. The bottom is but shallow whence they  
come.  
9. Your fate is but the common fate of all ;  
10. Unmingled joys here to man befall.  
11. Nature to each allots his proper sphere—  
12. Fortune makes folly her peculiar care.  
13. Custom does often reason overrule,  
14. And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
15. Live well, how long or short, permit to  
  
heaven ;  
  
16. They who forgive most shall be most  
forgiven.  
  
17. Sin may be clasped so close we cannot  
see its fac»—  
  
18. Vile interco1rse where virtue has not  
place ;

A LITERARY CURIOSITY.  
The following very remarkable little  
poem is a contribution to the San Francisco  
Times from the pen of Mrs. H. A. Deming.  
The reader will see that each line is a  
quotation from some one of the standard  
authors of England and America. This is  
the result of a year&#x27;s laborious search among  
the voluminous writings of thirty-eight lead­

number of each line refers to its author

5. To be is better far than not to be,  
6. Though all men&#x27;s lives may ceem a trage­

Curious Life Poem.  
Mr. H. A. Deming, of San Francisco,  
is said to have occupied a year in hunt­  
ing up and fitting together the following  
thirty-eight English poems. The names  
of the authors are given below:  
1— Why all this toil for triumphs of an  
hour?  
2 Life&#x27;s a short summer man a flow­  
er.  
3By turns we catch the vital breath,  
and die—  
4 The cradle and the tomb, alas! so  
nigh.  
STo be is better far than not to  
be.  
6 Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a  
tragedy:  
7 But life cares speak when mighty  
cares are dumb.  
8— The bottom is but shallow whence  
they come  
9 Your fate is but the common fate  
of all:  
10— Uumingled joys here to no man be­  
fall.  
11— Nature to each allots his proper  
sphere.  
12— Fortune makes folly her peculiar  
care.  
13— Custom does often reason over­  
rule,  
14— And throws a cruel cunshine on a  
fool.  
15— Live well, how long or short, per­  
mit to heaven.  
17—Sin may be clasped so close we  
cannet see its face—  
IS—Vile intercourse where virtue has  
not place;  
19— Then keep each passion down,  
however dear,  
20— Thou pendulum betwixt a smile  
and a tear;  
21— Her sensual snares, let faithless  
pleasure lay  
22— With craft and skill to ruin and  
betray;  
24— Soar not too high to fall, but  
stoop to rise.  
25— We masters grow of all that we  
dispise.  
27— Riches have wings and grandeur is  
a dream.  
28— Tho path of glory leads but to the  
grave  
29— What is ambition? ’tis but a glor­  
ious cheat.  
30— Only destructive to the brave and  
great.  
31— What&#x27;s all the guady glitter of a  
crown ?  
qo TU wojr Hilda lias Tinf. nn Hnclfs

s—To be is better far than not to bo.  
B—’Though all man&#x27;s Hie may seem a tragedy;  
7 But light cares speak when mighty cares  
are dumb,  
8— The bottom is but shallow whence they  
cotne.  
I&gt;—Your fate is but the common fate of all:  
10— Unmingled joys here to no man befall.

22 With craft and skill to ruin and betray;  
23 Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise.  
24 We masters grow of all that we despise.

dream.  
27 Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tla

28— The path of glory leads but to the grave.  
29 What is ambition? &#x27;tis a glorious cheat,  
30— Only destructive to the brave and great.  
31— What’s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
32 The way to bless lies not on beds of down.

37 Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tis brave,

THE JOUiilr-  
  
A LTTSSAST CUS10S1TT.&#x27;  
A lady occupied a whole year in search  
ing for and fitting&quot; the following thirty­  
eight lines from. English and American  
poems. The whole reads almost as if  
it had been written at one time and by  
one author :  
LITE.  
1.. Why all this toil for the triumphs of  
an hour?  
2. Life&#x27;s short summer man is but a  
flower;  
3. By turns we catch the fatal breath  
and die.  
4. The cradle and the tomb, alas I so  
.nigh.  
5. To be is better far than not to be.  
6. Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a  
tragedy;  
7. But light cares speak when mighty  
grief is dumb  
S. The bottom is but shallow wheuce  
they come.  
0. Your fate is but the common fate of  
all;  
10.  
11.  
13.  
13.  
L&#x27;nmingled joy3 here no man befall.  
Nature to each allots bis proper  
sphere.  
Fortune makes folly her peculiar  
care:  
Custom does often reason over-rule,  
14. And throw a cruel sunshine on a  
fool.  
15,  
Live well how long or short permit  
to heaven.  
Those who forgive most shall be most  
forgiven.  
bin may be clasped so close we can­  
not see lis face  
Vilo intercourse where virtue has uot  
place.  
Then keep each passion however  
dear,  
Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and  
tear;  
Her sensual snares let faithless  
pleasure lay,  
With craft and skill to ruin and be­  
tray. Soar not too high to fall, but stoop  
to rise;  
We masters grow of all that we  
despise.  
Hi, then , renounce that impious  
self-esteem;  
Uichcs havo wings, and grandeur is  
a dream.  
Think not ambition wise because  
&#x27;t ies brav&#x27;.  
Tho paths of glory lead but, to the  
grave.  
Whit is ambition V &#x27;Tis hut a gloi­

How long we live, not years but

 VERITABLE POEM OF POEMS  
How a California Woman Spent Nearly a  
Year With the Bards.  
Mrs. H. A. Doming of San Francisco  
is said to have occupied a year in hunt­  
ing up and fitting together the follow­  
ing 38 lines from 38 English poets. The  
names of the authors are given below:  
1— Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
2— Life’s a short summer, man a flower.  
8—By turns we catch the vital breath and die,  
4— The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh!  
5— To be is better far than not to be,  
6— &#x27;Though all man’s life may seem a tragedy,  
7— But light cares speak when mighty cares  
are dumb—  
8— The bottom is but shallow whence they  
come.  
9— Your fate is but the common fate of all;  
10— Unmingled joys here to no man befall.  
11— Nature to each allots his proper sphere,  
12— Fortune makes folly her peculiar care.  
13— Custom does often reason overrule  
14— And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
15— Live well, how long or short permit of  
heaven,  
13—They who forgive most shall be most for  
given.  
17— Sin may be clasped so close w*e cannot see  
its face­  
18— Vile intercourse where virtue has not place.  
19— Then keep each passion down, however  
dear,  
20— Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear.  
21— Her sensual snares let faithless pleasures  
lay  
22— With craft and skill to ruin and betray.  
23— Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise,  
24— We masters grow of all that we despise.  
25— Oh, then renounce that impious self es­  
teem—  
26— Riches have wings,and grandeur is a dream.  
27— Thi nk not ambition wise because ’tis brave,  
28— The paths of glory lead but to the grave.  
29— What is ambition? ’Tis a glorious cheat,  
30— Only destructive to the brave and great.  
31— What’s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
32— The way to bliss lies not on beds of down.  
33— How long we live not years, but actions,  
tell;  
34— That man lives twice who lives the first life  
well.  
35— Make, then, while yet you may, your God  
your friend,  
36— Whom Christians worship, yet not compre­  
hend.  
37— The trust that’s given guard, and to your  
self be just,  
38— For live we how we can, yet die we must.
