The following remarkable little poem is a contribution to the San Francisco Times, from the pen of Mrs. H. A. Deming. The reader will notice that each line is a quotation from some one of the standard authors of England and America. This is the result of a year&#x27;s laborious search among the voluminous writings of thirty-eight leading poets of the past and present. The number of each line refers to the author below:  
  
LIFE.  
  
1—Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
2—Life&#x27;s a short summer, man a flower;  
  
3—By turns we catch the vital breath and die—  
4—The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh.  
  
5—To be is better far than not to be,  
6—Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a tragedy;  
  
7—But light cares speak when mighty griefs are dumb,  
8—The bottom is but shallow when they come.  
  
9—Your fate is but the common fate of all;  
10—Unmingled joys, here, to no man befall,  
  
11—Nature to each allots his proper sphere,  
12—Fortune makes folly her peculiar care;  
  
13—Custom does not often reason overrule,  
14—And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
  
15—Live well, how long or short permit to heaven.  
16—They who forgive most, shall be most forgiven.  
  
17—Sin may be clasped so close we cannot see its face—  
18—Vile intercourse where virtue has no place;  
  
19—Then keep each passion down, however dear,  
20—Thou pendulum, betwixt a smile and tear;  
  
21—Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasures lay,  
22—With craft and skill, to ruin and betray;  
  
23—Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise,  
24—We masters grow of all that we despise.  
  
25—O, then, renounce that impious self-esteem;  
26—Riches have, wings, and grandeur is a dream.  
  
27—Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tis brave,  
28—The paths of glory lead but to the grave.  
  
29—What is ambition?—&#x27;tis a glorious cheat!—  
30—Only destructive to the brave and great.  
  
31—What&#x27;s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
32—The way to bliss lies not on beds of down.  
  
33—How long we live, not years, but actions, tell;  
34—That man lives twice who lives the first life well.  
  
35—Make, then, while yet we may, your God your friend.  
36—Whom Christians worship, yet not comprehend.  
  
37—The trust that&#x27;s given guard; and to yourself be just;  
38—For, live we how we can, yet die we must.

A Literary Curiosity,  
The following remarkable little poem  
is a contribution to the San Francisco  
Times, from the pen of Mr. H. A. Dein­  
ing. The readers will notice that each  
line is a quotation from some one of the  
standard authors of England and Amer­  
ica. This is the result of a year&#x27;s labo­  
rious search anions: the voluminous writ  
ings of thirty-eight leading poets of the  
past and present. The number of each  
line refers to the author below :

The following remarkable liitle poem is a con-  
tribution to the San Francisco Times. Each line  
is a quotation from some one of the standard  
authors of England and America. It is the result  
of a search among the voluminous writings of  
thirty-eight leading poets of the past and present.  
The number of each line refers to its author below.  
  
LIFE.  
  
1—Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour ?  
  
2—Life’s a short summer, man a flower.  
  
3- 4 turns we catch the vital breath and die—  
  
4—The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh. j  
s--To be, is better far than not to be,  
  
6—Though all man’s life may seem a tragedy ;  
  
7— But light cares speak when mighty griefs are dumb  
8-—The bottom is but shallow whence they come. ‘  
9—Your fate is but the common fate of all;  
1o—Unmingled joys here to no man befall.  
  
s1—Nature to each allots his proper sphere ;  
12—Fortune makes folly her peculiar care ;  
13—Custom does often reason overrule,  
14—And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
  
15—Live well; how long or short, permit to heaven ;  
16—They who forgive most shall be most forgiven.  
17—Sin may be clasped so close that we cannot sec its face ;  
18—Vile intercourse where virtue has no place.  
  
ssion down, however dear;  
  
19—Then keep each f :  
twixt a smile and tear.  
  
20—Thou pendulum  
  
21—Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasures lay ;  
  
2a—With craft and skill, to ruin and betray ;  
  
23—Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to raise,  
  
24—We masters grow of all that we despise.  
  
25—O, then, I r that impi self-esteem ;  
  
26—Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream.  
  
27—Think not ambition’ wise because ‘tis brave,  
  
28—The paths of glory lead but to the grave,  
  
29—What is ambition ?—’tis a glorious cheat !—  
  
30--Only destructive to the brave and great.  
  
31—What&#x27;s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
  
32—The ways of bliss lies not on beds of down.

A LITERARY CURIOSITY. The following  
remarkable little poem is a contribution  
to the San Francisco from the pen of  
Mrs. H. .A. Deming. The reader will  
notice that each line is a quotation  
from some of the standard authors of  
England and America. This is the result  
of a 3&#x27;car&#x27;a &#x27;laborious search among the  
voluminous writings ol thirtyeight  
leading poets of the past and present.  
The number of each line refers to^ its  
author below: LIFE. 1. Why all this toil  
for triumphs of an hour ? 2. Life&#x27;s a  
short summer, man a flower. 3. By turns  
we catch the vital breath and die4. The  
cradle and tiie tomb, alas! so nigh. 5.  
To be, i3 better far than not to be, 6.  
Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a  
tragedy; 7. But light cares speak when  
mighty griefs are dumb, 8. The bottom is  
but shallow whence they come. 9. Your  
fate is but the common fate of all; 10.  
Unmingled joys here to no man befall.  
11. Nature to each allots its proper  
sphere; 12. Fortune makes folly  
her*peculiar care. 13. Custom does often  
reason overrule, 14. And throw a cruel  
sunshine on a fool. 15. Live well; how  
long or short, permit to Heaven ; 16.  
They who forgive most shall be most for  
given. 17. Sin may be clasped so close  
we cannot see its face 18. Vile  
intercourse, where virtue has no place.  
19. Then keep each passion down, however  
dear, 20. Thou pendulum betwixt a smile  
and tear. SI. Her sensual snares let  
faithless pleasure lay, 22. With craft  
and skill, to ruin and betray. 23. Soar  
not to high too fall, but stoop to rise;  
24. We masters grow of all that we  
despise. 25. Oh, then, I renounce that  
impious self-es teem&quot;; . 26. Riches have  
wings, and grandeur is a dream. 27.  
Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tis  
brave; 28. The paths of glory lead but  
to the grave. 29. What is ambition! &#x27;Tis  
a glorious cheat 80. Only destructive to  
the braie and great. 31. What&#x27;s all the  
gaudy glitter of a crown; 32. The way to  
bliss lies not on beds of down. 33. How  
long we live, not years, but actions

A Literary Curiosity.  
The following remarkable little poem is  
a contribution to the San Francisco Times  
from the pen of Mrs. H. A. Deming. The  
reader will notice that each line is a quota­  
tion from some one of the standard authors 1  
of England and America. This is the re- 1  
suit of a year&#x27;s search among the volumin­  
ous writing of thirty-eight leading poets of  
the past and present. The number of each  
line refers to its author below:—  
LIFE.  
1. Why all this toil for triumphs of an ■  
hour?  
2. Life&#x27;s a short summer, man a flower.  
I!. By turns we catch the vital breath and  
die—  
4. The cradle and the tomb, alas ! so nigh.  
5. To be, is lietter far than not to ho,  
(1. Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a  
tragedy;  
7. But light cares speak when mighty  
griefs are dumb  
8. The bottom is but shallow whence they  
come.  
9. Your fate is but the common fate of  
all:  
10. Unmingled joys here to no man befall.  
11. Nature to each allots its proper sphere;  
12. Fortune makes folly her peculiar care.  
13. Custom docs not often reason overrule,  
14. And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
15. Live well: how long or short, permit to  
Heaven;  
10. They who forgive most shall be most  
forgiven.  
17. Sin may bo clasped so close we cannot  
sec its face—  
-18. Vile intercourse, where virtue has no  
place.  
10. Then keep each passion down, however  
dear,  
20. Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and  
tear.  
21. Her sensual snares let faithless pleasure  
lay,  
22. W itli craft and skill, to ruin and be­  
tray.  
23. Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to  
rise;  
24. We masters grow of all that we des­  
pise.  
25. Oh, then I renounce that impious self­  
esteem ;  
2(1. Riches have wings and grandeur is a  
dream.  
27. Think not ambition wise because ‘tis  
brave;  
28. The paths of glory lead but to the  
grave.  
29. What is ambition? ‘Tis a glorious  
cheat—  
30. Only destructive to the brave and  
great?  
31. W hat&#x27;s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
32. The way to bliss lies not on beds of  
down.  
33. How long we live, not years, but actions  
tell;

2. Life’s a short summer, man a flower;   
3. By turns we catch the vital breath and die   
4. The cradle and the tomb, alas! so nigh.   
5 To be is far better than not to be,  
&lt;6. Though all man’ life seems tragedy;   
7. But light cares speak, when mighty griefs are   
dumb.   
8. The bottom is but shadow whence they comer.   
9. Your fate is but the common fate of all;   
10. Unmiiigled joys here to no man fall.   
11. Nature to each allots here proper sphere,  
1Y Fortune makes folly her peculiar care ;   
13. Custom does not often reason overrule,  
11&quot; And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.   
15. L’ve well—how long or short, permit to heaven;   
16. ibey who forgive most shall be most forgiven.   
17. Sin may be elapsed so close we cannot see it   
face &quot;&quot;   
18. Vile intercourse where virtue has not place;   
19. Then keep each passion down, however dear,   
20. Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear;   
■2l. Her sensual snares let faithless pleasure lay,   
22. With craft and skill, to ruin and betray;   
23. Soar not too high to fall, but stoep to rise;   
24. We masters grow of all that we despise.   
25. Oh, then, renounce that impious self-esteem !   
26. Riches Lave wings, and grandeur is a dream.   
27. Think not ambition wise because ’tis brave;   
28. The paths of glory lead but to the grave.   
29. What’s ambit io a? ’Tis a glorious cheat,

The following very remarkable little poem is  
a contribution to the San Francisco Times from  
the pen of Mrs. H. A. Dem i ng. The reader will  
see that each line is a quotation from some one  
of the standard authors of England and Amer­  
ica. This is the result of a year&#x27;s laborious  
search among the voluminous writings of thir­  
ty-eight leading poets of tbe past and present.  
The number of each line refers to its author be­  
low:  
LIFE.  
L Why all this toll for triumphs of an hour?  
2. Life&#x27;s a short summer, man a flower.  
3. By turns we catch the vital breath and die;  
4. The cradle and the tomb, alas! so nigh.  
5. To be is better far than not to be,  
6. Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a tragedy:  
7. But light cares speak when mighty griefs  
are dumb,  
8. The bottom is but shallow whence they  
come,  
iA\ Yoarihteis but* Che common fate of all;  
10. lTn mingled joys here no man can befall.  
11. Nature to each allots his proper sphere;  
12. Fortune makei lolly her peculiar care,  
13. Custom does often reason overrule,  
11. And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool;  
IS. Live well; how long or short, permit to  
heaven.  
10. They who forgive most shall be most for­  
given.  
17. Sin may be clasped so ciose we cannot see  
its face—  
18. Vile intercourse where virtue has no place,  
19. Then keep each passion down, however dear,  
20. Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear,  
21. Her sensual snares let faithless pleasure lay,  
22. With craft and skill to ruin and betray,  
23. Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise;  
21. We masters grow of all that we despise.  
25. Oh, then renounce that impious self esteem;  
26. Riches have wings, and grandeuris a dream,  
27. Think not ambition wise because&#x27;tls brave;  
28. The paths of glory lead bnt to the grave.  
29. What Is ambition ? &#x27;Tis a glorious cheat—

are for reforenoe to the note below:— t  
Why all this toil for triumphs of an  
hour P 2 Life&#x27;s a short summer and a man  
a Hover f 3 By turns we catch the vital  
breath and die— 4 The cradle and the  
tomb, alas, eo nigh. C To be Is better  
far than not be, 6 Though all man&#x27;s life  
inar seem a tragedy; 7 But iisht cares  
speak when mighty griefs are dumb,&#x27; 8  
The bottom is but shallow whence they  
oome 9 Your fate is but the.common fate  
of all, 10 Unmingled joys here to no man  
befell; 11 Nature to each allots bis  
proper spheie, 12 fortune makes folly  
her peculiar care. 13 Custom does often  
reason overrule, U And throw a oruol  
sunshine on a foal; 16 Lire well, how  
long or (hart permit to heaven, 16 Thoy  
who forgive moat, shall tie most for  
given. 17 8m may be clupod ao close sre

faithless pleasure lay, 22 With craft  
aod ekill to ruin and betny; 33 Soar not  
too high to fall but stoop to rise, 24  
Wo misters grow of all we most despise.  
25 O, then renounce that impious gelf-  
esteem, 26 Riches have wrongs and

A Literary Curiosity—The following re­  
markable little poem, says the New York  
Tribune was originally a contribution to  
the San Francisco Times, from the pen of  
Mrs. H. A. Deming. The readers will  
notice that each line is a quotation from  
someone of the standard authors of Eng­  
land and America. This is the result of  
much laborious search among the volum­  
inous writings of thirty eight leading  
poets of the past and present:  
LIFE.  
1. Why all this toil for the trumphs of  
an hour?  
2. Life’s a short summer, man a flower.  
3. By turns we catch the vital breath and  
die—  
4. The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh.  
5. To be is better far than not to be,  
6. Though all man&#x27;s life may seem a  
tragedy;  
7. But light cares speak when mighty  
griefs are dumb;  
8. The bottom is but shallow when they  
come.  
9. Your fate is the common fate of all;  
10. Unmlngled joy to no man here befall.  
11. Nature to each allots his proper sphere;  
12. Fortune makes folly her peculiar care;  
13. Custom does not often reason overrule,  
14. And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
15. Live well, how long or short permit  
to heaven,  
16. They who forgive most shall be for­  
given.  
17. Sin may be clasped so close we cannot  
see Its face—  
-18. Vile Intercourse where virtue has no  
place.  
19. Then keep each passion down, how­  
ever dear;  
20. Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and  
tear.  
21. Her sensual snares, let faithless pleas­  
ure lay,  
22. With craft and skill to ruin and lie  
tray;  
  
23. Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to  
rise, *  
21. We master&#x27;s grow of all that we de­  
spise.  
25. O, then, renounce that Impious self-es­  
teem ;  
29. Riches have wings, and grandeur Is a  
dream.  
27. Think not ambition wise because &#x27;tls  
brave,  
28. The paths of glory lead but to the  
grave.  
29. What is ambition?—&#x27;tls a glorious  
cheat!  
30. Only destructive to the brave and  
great,  
31. What’s all the gaudy glitter of a  
crown ?  
32. The way to bliss lies not on beds of  
down.  
33 How long we live not years, hut actions  
tell,  
34. That man lives twice who lives the first  
life well.  
35. Make. then, while yet ye may, your  
God your friend,  
36. Whom Christians worship, yet not

line of different poems, is quite interesting. It is said that  
the author spent one year in hunting up and titling together  
the lines, and quite an instructive and interesting evening  
entertainment can be had by reading the poem and letting  
each in the social gathering guess who is the author of the  
different lines. Then refer to the key given beloxx and see  
how many are right.  
A VERI TABLE I’OEM OF I‘OEMS  
1- Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?  
2 Life’s a short summer man a Hower.  
3 By turns we catch the vital breath and die.  
I The cradle and the tomb, alas! so nigh.  
s—To be is better far than not to be,  
&lt;&gt; ’Though all man’s life may seem a tragedy;  
7 But light cares speak when mighty cares are dumb.  
8- &#x27;J&#x27;he bottom is but shallow xvhen they come.  
9 Your fate is but the common fate of all:  
Hl Unmingled joys here to no man befall.  
11 Nat ure to each allots his proper sphere  
12 Fortune makes folly her peculiar care:  
13 Custom does often reason oxerrule.  
14— And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.  
15— Live xvell. hoxx long or short, permit to Heaven.  
I(l—They xx ho forgive most shall lie most forgiven.  
17 Sin may be clasped so close we cannot see its face—  
is Vile intercourse xx here virtue has not placed;  
19 T hen keep each passion down, however dear:  
20—Thou pendulum betwixt a smile ami tear:  
21 Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasure lax  
22 With craft and skill to ruin and betray;  
23 Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise  
24 We masters grow of all that we despise.  
25—Oh. then renounce that impious self-esteem;  
2(&gt; Riches have wings, and grandeur is a drcam.  
■_&#x27;« Think not ambition wise because ’tis brave  
28—The path of glory leads but to the grave.  
29 —What is ambition? Tis a glorious cheat.  
30— Only destructive to the brave and great.  
31— What’s all the gaudy glitter of a crown?  
32 The xvay to blis- lie-, not on bed- of down.  
33—How long xve live, not years, but actions tell:  
3) —That man lives twice who lives the first life well.  
35 Make. then, xvhile vet ye mav. votir God your  
friend.  
3f&gt;—Whom Christians worship, vet not comprehend.  
27—The trust that’s given guard, and to yourself be  
just:  
3s —For. live we hoxx xve can yet die xve must.
