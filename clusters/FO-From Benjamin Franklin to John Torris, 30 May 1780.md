. Passy, May 30, 1780.  
Sir,  
  
In my last of the 27th Instant, I omitted one  
thing I had intended, viz. to desire you would  
give absolute orders to your cruisers not to bring  
any ‘more Dutch vessels, though charged with  
enemy&#x27;s goods, unless contraband. All the neu-  
tral states of Europe seem at present disposed  
to change what had before been deemed the law  
of nations, to wit, that an enemy’s property may  
be taken wherever found ; and to establish a rule  
that free ships, shall make free goods. This  
rule is itself so reasonable, and of a nature to be  
so beneficial to mankind, that I cannot but wish  
it may become general, and I make no doubt,  
but that the Congress will agree to it, in as full  
an extent, as France and Spain. In the mean-

| time, and until I have received their orders on  
  
the subject, it is my intention to condemn no  
more English goods, found in Dutch vessels, un-  
less contraband ;_ of which I thought it right to  
give you this previous notice, that you may avoid  
the trouble and expense likely to arise from  
such captures, and from the detention of them  
fora decision. With great regard, and best
