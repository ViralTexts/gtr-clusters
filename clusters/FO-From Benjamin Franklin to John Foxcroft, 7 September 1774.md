Mr. Todd call’d to see me yesterday. I perceive there is a good deal of Uneasiness at the Office concerning the Delay of the Accounts. He sent me, in the Evening, to read and return to him a Letter he has written to you for this Mail. Friendship requires me to urge earnestly your Attention to the Contents, if you value the Continuance of your Appointment; for these are times of Uncertainty, and I think it not unlikely that there is some Person in view ready to step into your Shoes if a tolerable reason could be given for dismissing you. Mr. Todd is undoubtedly your Friend. But every thing is not always done as he would have it. This to yourself; and I confide that you will take it as I mean it, for your Good.  
Several Packets are arriv’d since I have had a Line from you: But I had the Pleasure of seeing by yours to Mr. Todd, that you and Mrs. Foxcroft with your little Girl, are all in good Health, which I pray may continue. I am ever, my dear old Friend, Yours most affectionately  
B Franklin

Mr. Todd called to see me yesterday. I perceive there is good  
  
deal of uneasiness at the office concerning the Delay of the Accounts. He sent  
me in the Evening to read and return to him a Letter he had written to you  
for the Mail. Friendship requires me to urge earnestly your Attention to the  
contents, if you value the Continuance of your Appointment; for these are  
times of uncertainty, and I think it not unlikely that there is some Person in  
view ready to step into your Shoes, if a tolerable reason could be given for dis-  
missing you. Mr. Todd is undoubtedly your Friend. But everything is not  
always done as he would have it. This to yourself; and I confide that you  
will take it as I mean it for your .  
  
Several packets are arrived since I have had a Line from you. But I had  
the pleasure of seeing by yours to Mr. Todd that you and Mrs. Foxcroft with  
your little Girl are all in good Health which I pray may continue.  
  
I am ever my dear old friend  
Yours most affectionately  
B. FRANKLIN.
