‘ I am not sure that in reforming the constitution which is  
sometimes talked of, it would not be better to make your great  
officers of state hereditary than to suffer the inconvenience of such  
frequent and total changes. Much faction and cabal would be  
prevented by having: an hereditary first-Lord of the Treasury, an  
hereditary Lord Chancellor, Privy Seal, President of Council,  
Secretary of State, first Lord of the Admiralty, &amp;c. &amp;c. It will not  
be said that the duties of. these offices being important, we cannot  
trust to nature for the chance of requisite talents, since we have an  
hereditary set of judges in the last resort, the House of Peers ; an  
hereditary King; and ina certain German University, an here-  
ditary professor of mathematics.’ P. 228.
