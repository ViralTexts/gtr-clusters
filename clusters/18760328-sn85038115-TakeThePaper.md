**Take the Paper**  
  
We find the following going the rounds of the press. Read, ponder, and—PAY UP! Why don&#x27;t you take the papers? they&#x27;re the life of my delight, except about election time, and then I read for spite. Subscribe, you cannot loose a cent, why should you be afraid? for cash thus spent is money lent at interest, four-fold paid. Go, then, and take the papers, and pay to-day, nor pay delay, and my word it is inferred, you&#x27;ll live until you&#x27;re gray. An old neighbor of mine, while dying of a cough, desired to hear the latest news while he was going off. I took the paper and I read of some new pills in force; he bought a box—and is he dead? no—hearty as a horse. I knew two men as much alike as e&#x27;er you saw two stumps; and no phrenologist could find a difference in their bumps. One takes the paper and his life is happier than a king&#x27;s, his children can all read and write, and talk of men and things. The other took no paper, and, while strolling through the wood, a tree fell down and broke his crown, and killed him—&quot;very good.&quot; Had he been reading all the news, at home like his neighbor Jim, I&#x27;ll be a cent that accident would not have happened him, for he who takes the paper, and pays his bill when due, can live in peace with every man, and with the printer too.

Sweets, that despairing man might t3ste,

Take the Papers.  
BY IT. P. WILLIS.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the papers ?  
They&#x27;re the life of my delight;  
Except about election time,  
And then I read for spite.  
Subscribe! you cannot lose a cent,  
Why should you be afraid ?  
For cash thus paid is money lent  
On interest four-fold paid.  
Go, then, and take the papers,  
And pay to-day, nor pay delay,  
And mind my word for its inferred;  
You&#x27;ll live until you&#x27;re gray.  
A a old neighbor of mine,  
While dying of a cough  
Desired to hear the latest news  
While he was dying off.  
I took the paper and I read  
Of some new pills in force;  
He took a box—and is he dead ?  
No—hearty as a herse.  
I knew a printer&#x27;s debtor once,  
Baked with a scorching fever,  
Who swore to pay her debt next day,  
If her distress would leave her.  
&quot;Here, Jessie, take these silver wheels,  
And pay the printer now!&#x27;&#x27;  
She slept, and slept, and then awoke,  
With health upon her brow.  
I knew two men, as much alike,  
As e&#x27;er you saw two stumps,  
And no phrenologist could find  
A difference in their bumps.  
One took the papers, and his life  
Was happier than a king&#x27;s ;  
His children all could read and write,  
And talk of men and things.  
The other took no paper, and  
While strolling through the wood,  
A tree fell down and broke his crown  
And killed him ; very good.  
Had he been reading of the news,  
At home like neighbor Jim,  
I&#x27;ll bet a cent the accident  
Would not have happened him.  
Why don&#x27;t you take the papers,  
Nor from the printers sneak;  
Because you borrow of his boy  
A paper every week.  
For he who takes the papers,  
And pays his hills when due,  
Can live in peace with God and man,  
And with the printer too.

Why should vou he afraid?  
For cash thus pail is money lint  
At intere.&#x27;t four-fold paid.  
Go, t&#x27;len. and take the pap?rv,  
And pay to-day, nor pay delay,  
And my word fur it inferred

Of some new pills m force,  
He bought a box and he is dead?  
No hearty as a horse.

A dilference to their bumps.

Is happier fhan a king&#x27;s;  
His children can all read and wnto,  
And talk of men and flings.  
The cl&#x27;icr )ok no paper, and  
While strolling thruMh the yood  
A tree fell down and broke his crown,  
And killed him &quot;very good.&quot;  
Had he been reading of the news,  
At home like neighbor Jim,

Would not have happened him.

Nor from the pi Inter sneak,  
Uecause you borrow from hi 4 hoy
