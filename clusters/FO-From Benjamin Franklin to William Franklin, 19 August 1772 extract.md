London Augt. 19: 1772  
In yours of May 14th, you acquaint me with your indisposition, which gave me great concern. The resolution you have taken to use more exercise is extremely proper, and I hope you will steadily perform it. It is of the greatest importance to prevent diseases; since the cure of them by physic is so very precarious. In considering the different kinds of exercise, I have thought that the quantum of each is to be judged of, not by time or by distance, but by the degree of warmth it produces in the body: Thus when I observe if I am cold when I get into a carriage in a morning, I may ride all day without being warmed by it, that if on horse back my feet are cold, I may ride some hours before they become warm; but if I am ever so cold on foot, I cannot walk an hour briskly, without glowing from head to foot by the quickened circulation; I have been ready to say, (using round numbers without regard to exactness, but merely to mark a great difference) that there is more exercise in one mile’s riding on horseback, than in five in a coach; and more in one mile’s walking on foot, than in five on horseback; to which I may add, that there is more in walking one mile up and down stairs, than in five on a level floor. The two latter exercises may be had within doors, when the weather discourages going abroad; and the last may be had when one is pinched for time, as containing a great quantity of exercise in a handful of minutes. The dumb bell is another exercise of the latter compendious kind; by the use of it I have in forty swings quickened my pulse from 60 to 100 beats in a minute, counted by a second watch: And I suppose the warmth generally increases with quickness of pulse.

LoNDOn, 19 August, 1772  
Dear SON: In yours of May 14 you acquaint  
me with your indisposition, which gives me  
great concern. The resolution you have taken  
to use more exercise is extremely proper, and I  
hope you will steadily perform it. It is of the  
greatest importance to prevent diseases, since  
the curing of them by physic is so very pre­  
carious.  
In considering the different kinds of exercise  
I have thought that the quantum of each is to  
be judged-of, not by time or by distance, but by  
the degree of warmth it produces in the body,  
Thus, when I observe that I am cold when I  
get into a carriage in a morning, I may ride all  
day without being warmed by it; that if on  
horseback my feet are cold, I may ride some  
hours before they become warm. But, if I am  
ever so cold on foot, I cannot walk an hour  
briskly without glowing from head to foot with  
a quickened circulation. I have been ready to  
say (using round numbers without regard to  
exactness, but merely to make a great differ.­  
ence that there is more exercise in one mile&#x27;s  
riding on horseback than in five in a coach  
and more in one mile&#x27;s walking on foot  
than in five on horseback; to which I  
may add that there is more in walking  
one mile up and down stairs than in five on a  
level floor. The two latter exercises may be  
had within doors when the weather discourages  
going abroad, and the latter may be had when  
one is pinched for time, as giving a great quan­  
tity of exercise in a handful of minutes. The  
dumb-bell is another exercise of the latter  
compendious kind. By the use of it I have  
in forty swings quickened my pulse from sixty  
to one hundred beats in a minute, counted by  
a second watch; and I suppose the warmth  
generally increases with the quickness of pulse.

tunities for outdoor exercise are greater for some of us  
  
at this season than any other; and it is a matter of  
  
which we know 20 little, and one in which there is  
  
great diversity of opinion, that the opinion of a wise  
  
man is valuable. Sparks, in his ‘‘ Life of Franklin,”  
writes :  
  
** Franklin says :  
  
***In considering the different kinds of exorcise I  
have thought that the quantum of each is to be judged  
of, not by time or by distance, but by the degree of  
warmth it produces in the body. Thus, when I observe  
if 1 am cold when I get into a carriage in the morning,  
I may ride all day without belug warmed by it ; that  
if on horseback my feet are cold, I may ride some hours  
before they become warm ; but, if I am ever so cold on  
foot, I cannot walk an hour briskly without glowing  
from head to foot by the quickened circulation—I have  
been ready to say (using round numbers without regard  
to exactness, but merely to make a great difference) that  
there is more exercise in one mile’s riding on horseback  
than five in 8 coach, and more in one mile’s walking on  
foot than in five on horseback ; to which I may add that  
there is more in walking one mile up and down atairs  
than in five on a level floor. The two latter exercises  
may be had within doors, when the weather discour-  
ages going abroad ; and the last may be had when one  
is pinched for time, as containing a great quantity of  
exercise in a handful of minutes. The dumb-bell is  
another exercise of the latter compendious kind. By  
the use of it I have in forty swings quickened my pulse  
from sixty to one hundred beats in a minute, counted
