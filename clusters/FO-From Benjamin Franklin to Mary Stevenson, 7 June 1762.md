Our Ships for America do not sail so soon as I expected; it will be yet 5 or 6 Weeks before we embark, and leave the old World for the New. I fancy I feel a little like dying Saints, who in parting with those they love in this World, are only comforted with the Hope of more perfect Happiness in the next. I have in America Connections of the most engaging kind, and happy as I have been in the Friendships here contracted, those promise me greater and more lasting Felicity. But God only knows whether those Promises shall be fullfilled.
