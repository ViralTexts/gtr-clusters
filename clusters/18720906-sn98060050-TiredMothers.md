A little elbow leans upon your knee,  
Your tired knee, that has so much to bear;  
A child&#x27;s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingers, folding yours so tight;—  
You do not prize this blessing over-much,  
You almost are too tired to pray tonight.  
  
But it *is* blessedness! A year ago  
I did not see it as I do today,—  
We are so dull and thankless; and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me,  
That, while I wore the badge of mother-hood,  
I did not kiss more oft, and tenderly,  
The little child that brought me only good.  
  
And if, some night when you sit down to rest,  
You miss this elbow from your tired knee;  
This restless, curling head from off your breast,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly;  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle in your palm again;  
If the white feet into their grave had tripped,  
I could not blame you for your heart-ache then!  
  
I wonder that mothers ever fret,  
At little children clinging to their gown;  
Or that the foot-prints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor;  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear its patter in my home once more;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart today,  
Tomorrow make a kite, to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head;—  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown;  
The little boy I used to kiss is dead!

I did not kiss more oft, and tenderly,  
The little child that brought me only good.  
And if, some night when you sit down to rest,  
You miss this elbow from your tired knee;  
This restless, carling head from off your breast,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly;  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle in your palm again;  
If the white feet into their grave had tripped,

Tired Mothers.  
A little elbow leans upon your knee  
Your tired knee that has so much to bear;  
A child&#x27;s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingers holding yours so tight!  
You do not prize the blessing overmuch  
You almost are too tired to pray to-night.  
But it is blessedness! A year ago  
I did not see it as I do to-day  
We are all so dull and thankless, and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me  
That while I wore the badge of motherhood  
I did not kiss more oft and tenderly  
The little child that brought me only good.  
And if, some night, when you sit down to rest,  
You miss the elbow from your tired knee;  
This restless curly head from off your breast;  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly;  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle in your palm again,  
If the white feet into the grave had tripped  
I could not blame you for your heart-ache then.  
I wonder so that mothers ever fret  
At their little children clinging to their gown;  
Or that the footprints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor

A little elbow leans upon your knee—  
Your tired knee that has so much to boar—  
A child’s eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair,  
P erbaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingers holding yours so tight.  
You do not prize the blessings overmuch—  
You almost are too tired to pray to-night.  
  
But It Is blossednessl Ayearago  
I did not see it a* I do to-day—  
We are all so dull and thankless, and toa slow  
To catch the sunshine till It slips away.  
And now It seems surpassing strange to me  
That while I wore the badge of motherhood  
I did not kiss more oft and tenderly  
The little child that brought me only good  
  
And if, some night, when you sit down to rest.  
You miss the elbow on your tired knee—  
This restlesscurly head from off your breast ,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly;  
If from your own the dimpled hand had slipped.  
And ne’er would nestle In your palm again.  
If the white feet into the grave had tripped—  
I could not blame you for your heartache  
then.  
  
I wonder that some mothers ever fret  
At their little children clinging to their gown;  
Or that the footprints, when the days are wet.  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
If I could find a little muddy boot.  
Or cap, or Jacket, on my chamber floor—  
If 1 could kiss a rosy, restless foot  
And hear it patter In my bouse once more;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart to day,  
To-morrow make a kite to reaoh the sky.  
There is no woman In God’s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than II  
But ahl the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head!  
My singing birdllng from its nest has flown—

RY, One Tired Mother to Another. A

tired knee Hint ha&lt; .so much lo bear : A  
child&#x27;s dj&#x27;ir eves me looking lovingly  
from underneath a t hatch of tangled  
hair. Perhaps you do not. heed the  
velvet, touch _ Of. warm, moist lingers  
folding yours so tight ; Von do not  
prize thin blessing over-much ; Vou  
almost are loo tired to pray to-night.  
IV.it. it. is biassedne-s ! A year nfro  
J did not we it as I do to-day. Wo aie  
so didl and thankles-i, and too slow To  
catch the Hiuisliijie till it slips  
away. And now it seems surpassing  
strange to me &#x27;J&#x27;liat while I wore the  
badge of motherhood I did&#x27;not. kiss move  
oft and tenderly &#x27;J&#x27;he little child that  
brought me only good. And if.noine  
night, when you hit down to rest, You  
inks the elbow from your tired knee, The  
re-tless, enrlv head from oil: vour  
breast, The lisping tongue that  
chattered constantly . If from your own  
the dimpled hnnd&lt; had flipped, And ne&#x27;er  
woiill nestle in your | lalm again ; If  
the while feel into the grave have  
tripped . I could not blame you fnrvotir  
lic.&#x27;irt-ache then. I wonder fo tlint  
inothcis fret At little children  
clinging to their gown, Or that the foot  
prinl«, when the days are wet, &quot;&quot;Are  
ever black enorgh to make them frown. If  
I could liii&#x27;t a lit tie muddy boot. Or  
cap. or jacket, on my chamber lloor; If  
I could kiss a ro-y. rcsllc-w foot. And  
hear it. palter in my home once more. If  
f could mend a broken cart to-dny. To-  
morrow make a kite to reach the sky,
