<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

A little elbow leans upon your knee,  
Your tired knee, that has so much to bear;  
A child&#x27;s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingers, folding yours so tight;—  
You do not prize this blessing over-much,  
You almost are too tired to pray tonight.  
  
But it *is* blessedness! A year ago  
I did not see it as I do today,—  
We are so dull and thankless; and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me,  
That, while I wore the badge of mother-hood,  
I did not kiss more oft, and tenderly,  
The little child that brought me only good.  
  
And if, some night when you sit down to rest,  
You miss this elbow from your tired knee;  
This restless, curling head from off your breast,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly;  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle in your palm again;  
If the white feet into their grave had tripped,  
I could not blame you for your heart-ache then!  
  
I wonder that mothers ever fret,  
At little children clinging to their gown;  
Or that the foot-prints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor;  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear its patter in my home once more;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart today,  
Tomorrow make a kite, to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head;—  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown;  
The little boy I used to kiss is dead!

Your tired knee that has so much to  
bear,  
A child&#x27;s deareyes are looking lovingly,  
Vrom underneath a thatch of tangled  
hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet  
touch  
Of warm, moist lingers folding yours  
so tight. &#x27;  
You do not prize this blessing over­  
much,You almost are too tired to pray to­  
night.Tint ill is blessedness! A year ago  
1 did not see it as do to&#x27; day.  
AVe are so dull and thankless and too  
slow  
To catch t he sunshine, till itslips away.  
And now It seems surpassing strange  
to me  
That, while I wore the badge of mother­  
hood ,  
I did not kiss more oft and tenderly,  
The little child that brought me only  
good.  
And if, some night when you sit down  
to rest,  
You miss the elbow from your tired  
knee, .  
The restless, curly head from off your  
breast.  
The lisping tongue that chattered con­  
stantly ;  
If from your own the dimpled hands  
had slipped  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle in your palm  
&#x27; again,  
If the while tleet into the grave had  
tripped  
I could not blame you for your heart­  
ache then.  
1 wonder so, that mothers ever fret  
At littlo children clinging to their  
gown;  
Or that the foot-prints, when the days  
are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them  
frown.  
If 1 could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chain her lloor,  
If I could kiss a rosy , restless foot,  
And hear it patter in my home once  
more;  
If I could mend a broken cart to-day,  
To-morrow make a kite to reach the  
sky,  
There is no woman in (iod&#x27;s world

LE elbow leans upon your knee,  
  
Your tired knee that has so much to bear ;  
A child&#x27;s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair,  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
  
Of warm, moist fingers, folding yours so tight—  
You do not prize this blessing overmuch :  
  
You almost are too tired to pray to-night.  
  
But it is blessedness! A year ago  
I did not see it as I do to-day—  
We are so dull and thankless ; and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me  
That, while I wore the badge of motherhood,  
I did not kiss more oft and tenderly  
The little child that brought me only good.  
  
And if, some night, when you sit down to rest,  
You miss the elbow from your tired knee,  
  
This restless, curling head from off your breast,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly ;  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne’er would nestle in your palm again ;  
  
If the white feet into their grave had tripped,  
I could not blame you for your headache then !  
  
I wonder sothat mothers ever fret  
At little children clinging to their gown,  
Or that the footprints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
‘If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor ;  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear a patter in my home once more ;  
  
If | could mend a broken cart to-day,  
  
To-morrow make a kite to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could say  
  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
  
Is never rumpled by a shining head ;  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown  
  
The little boy I used to kiss is dead !
