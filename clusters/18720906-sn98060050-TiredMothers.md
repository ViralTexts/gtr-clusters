A little elbow leans upon your knee,  
Your tired knee, that has so much to bear;  
A child&#x27;s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingers, folding yours so tight;—  
You do not prize this blessing over-much,  
You almost are too tired to pray tonight.  
  
But it *is* blessedness! A year ago  
I did not see it as I do today,—  
We are so dull and thankless; and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me,  
That, while I wore the badge of mother-hood,  
I did not kiss more oft, and tenderly,  
The little child that brought me only good.  
  
And if, some night when you sit down to rest,  
You miss this elbow from your tired knee;  
This restless, curling head from off your breast,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly;  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle in your palm again;  
If the white feet into their grave had tripped,  
I could not blame you for your heart-ache then!  
  
I wonder that mothers ever fret,  
At little children clinging to their gown;  
Or that the foot-prints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor;  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear its patter in my home once more;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart today,  
Tomorrow make a kite, to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head;—  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown;  
The little boy I used to kiss is dead!

MOTHERS. A little elbow leans upon your  
knee, lour tired knee that has so much  
to bear, A child&#x27;s dear eyes are looking  
lovingly From underneath a thatch of  
tanaled hair. PerhapB you do not heed  
the velvet touch Of warm, moist fingers,  
folding yours so tight; You do not prize  
this blessing over much, You are almost  
too tired to pray to-night.  
Butitishlessedne*. A year ago I did not  
Bee it as I do to-day— We were so dull  
and thankless: and too slow To catch the  
Eunshine till it slipB away. And now it  
seemB surpassing strange to me, That  
while I wore the badge of motherhood, I  
did not kiss more oft, and tenderly, The  
little child that brought me only good.  
And if, some night when you sit dawn to  
rest, You miss this little elbow from  
your knee ; This restless, curling head  
from oft your breast, This lisping  
tongue that chatters constantly; If from  
your own the dimpled hand had slipped.  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle m your palm  
again; If the white feet into their  
grave had tripped, I conld not blame you  
for your heartache then! I wonder so  
that mothers ever fret At little  
children clinging to their gown ; Or  
that the footprints, when the days are  
wet. Are ever black enough to make them  
frown. If I could find a little muddy  
boot, Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber  
floor ; If I could kiss a rosy restless  
foot, And hear its patter in my home  
once more. If I could mend a broken cart  
to-day. To-morrow make a kite to reach  
the sky, There is no woman in God&#x27;s  
world could say She was more blissfully  
content than I. But ah ! the dainty  
pillow next my own Is never rumpled by a  
shining head; My singing birdling from  
its nest is flown ; The little boy I  
used to kiss is dead

If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor—  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear it patter in my house once more;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart to-day,  
  
To morrow make a kite to reach the sky,  
There is no woman in God’s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than I!  
  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head!  
  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown—  
The little boy I used to kiss is—dead.  
  
  
  
A SECRET MARRIAGE  
  
AND  
  
ITS CONSEQUENCES.

[?] Tired Mothers. A little clbQT leans  
upon your knee— Your tired knee, that  
has so much to bear ; A child&#x27;s dear  
eyes are looking lovingly From  
underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the rclvct touch  
Of warm, moist fingers, holding you eo  
tight ; Ton do not prize this blessing  
over-much, ? Vmi are almost too timd tn  
nrar t/wniffht. But it is blessedness !  
A year ago I did not see it as I do to-  
day— We are so doll and thankless ; and  
too clow To catch the sunshine till it  
slips away. And now it seems surpassing  
ttrange to me Tnat, while I wore the  
badge of motherhood, 1 did not kiss more  
oft and tenderly The little child that  
brought me only good. And if, some  
night, when you fit down to reft, You  
miss his elbow from your tired knee ;  
This restless curling head from off your  
breast ; This lisping tongue that  
chatters constantly ; If from your own  
the dimpled hands had slipped, And ne&#x27;er  
would nestle in your palm again ; If the  
white feet into their grave had tripped,  
I coald not blame you for your heartache  
then ! I wonder so that mothers ever  
fret At little children elmffing to  
their gown ; Or that the footprints when  
the days are Tret, Are ever black enough  
to make them frown. If I could find a  
little muddy boot, Or cap, or jacket, on  
my chamber floor, If I could ki*5 a  
rosy, restless foot. And hear its patter  
in my home once more. If I could mend a  
broken cart to-day, To-morrow make a  
kite to reach the sky — There is no  
woman in God&#x27;s world would say 6he was  
more blissfully content than I. But ah !  
the dainty pillow nest my own Is never

A little elbow leans upoc your knee  
Your tired knee that has BO much to  
bear  
A childs dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch ot golden  
hair  
Perhaps you do not head the velvet touch  
Of warm moist fingers folding yours  
so tight  
You do not prize this blessing overmuch  
You almost are too tired to pray to­  
night  
But it is blesredness A year ago  
I did not see it as I do today  
We are so dull and thankless and too  
slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away  
And now it seems surprising strange to­  
me  
That while I wore the badge of mother­  
hood  
I did not kin more oft and tenderly  
The little child that brought me only  
good  
  
And if some night when you sit down to I  
rest  
You miss the elbow from your tired I  
knee  
The restless curly head from ofl your  
breast  
The lisping tonguo that chattered con­  
stantly  
If from your own the dimpled hands had  
slipped  
And neer would nestle in your palm  
again  
If the white feet into the grave had  
tripped  
I could not blame you for your heart­  
ache then  
I wonder to that mothers ever fret  
At little children clinging to their  
gOWA  
Or that the footprints when the days are  
wet  
Are over black enough to make them  
frown  
If I could find a little muddy boot  
Or cap or j ticket on my chamber floor  
If I could kiss a rosy restless foot  
And hear it patter in my house once  
more  
It I could mend a broken cart to diY  
Tomorrow make a kite to reach tha  
There sky is no woman in Godsworldcould
