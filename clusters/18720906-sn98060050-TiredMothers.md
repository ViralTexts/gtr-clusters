A little elbow leans upon your knee,  
Your tired knee, that has so much to bear;  
A child&#x27;s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingers, folding yours so tight;—  
You do not prize this blessing over-much,  
You almost are too tired to pray tonight.  
  
But it *is* blessedness! A year ago  
I did not see it as I do today,—  
We are so dull and thankless; and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me,  
That, while I wore the badge of mother-hood,  
I did not kiss more oft, and tenderly,  
The little child that brought me only good.  
  
And if, some night when you sit down to rest,  
You miss this elbow from your tired knee;  
This restless, curling head from off your breast,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly;  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne&#x27;er would nestle in your palm again;  
If the white feet into their grave had tripped,  
I could not blame you for your heart-ache then!  
  
I wonder that mothers ever fret,  
At little children clinging to their gown;  
Or that the foot-prints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor;  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear its patter in my home once more;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart today,  
Tomorrow make a kite, to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head;—  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown;  
The little boy I used to kiss is dead!

RS.  
A little elbow leans upon your knee,  
Your tired knee, that has so much to bear;  
Achild’s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingers, folding yours so tight;  
You do not prize this blessing over-much;  
You almost are too tired to pray, to-night.  
  
But it is blessedness! A year ago  
  
I did not see it as I do to-day ;  
  
We are so dull and thankless, and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away ;  
  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me,  
That, while I wore the badge of motherhood,  
I did not kiss more oft, and tenderly,  
  
The little child that brought me only good.  
  
And if, some night when you sit down to rest,  
You miss this elbow from your tired knee;  
  
This restless, curling head from off your breast,  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly ;  
Iffrom your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne’er would nestle in your palm again ;  
  
Ifthe white feet into their grave had tripped,  
Icould not blame you for your heartache then!  
  
I wonder so that mothers ever fret,  
  
At little children clinging to their gown;  
  
Or that the foot-prints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
IfI could find a little muddy boot,  
  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor;  
  
IfI could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
  
And hear its patter in my home once more;  
  
IfI could mend a broken cart to-day,  
To-morrow make a kite, to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God’s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than 1;  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
is never rumpled by a shining head ;  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown;  
The little boy I used to kiss is dead!

u do not heed the velvet touch  
Of warm, moist fingors folding yours bo  
tight;  
Ton do not prize this blesping over much,  
You are almost too tired to pray to-night.  
Bnt it is blessedness! Some years ago  
I did not see it as I do to-day  
We are so dnll and thankless; and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me,  
That while I wore the badsje of motherhood,  
I did not kiss mure oft and tenderly,  
The little child that brought me only good.  
And if some night when you sit down to rest,  
You miss the elbow from yonr tired knee ;  
This rewtless curling head from off your  
breast,  
The lisping tongue that clatters constantly :  
If from j.ur own, the dinrpled hands had  
slipped  
And ne&#x27;er wonld nestle in yonr own again,  
If the white feet into their grave had dropped,  
I could not blame you, for your Borrow  
then!  
I wonder bo that mothers ever fret,  
At little children clinging to their gown ;  
Or that the footprints when the day is wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown ;  
If I could find a littte mnddy boot.  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor,  
If I cuid kiss a rosy restless foot,  
And hear it patter in my home once more ;  
If I could mend a broken toy to-day,  
To-morrow make a kite to reach the sky  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could Bay,  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But ah ! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head ;  
My singing birdiing from its nest is flown;

And if, some night when yon sit down to

Your tired knee that has so much to bear;  
A child’s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.

If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear its patter in my house once more ;

To-morrow mend a kite to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own

My singing birdling from its nest is flown;

child’s dear eyes are looking lovingly  
  
From underneath a thatch of tangled hair.  
Perhaps you do not heed the velvet touch  
  
Of warm, moist fingers holding yours so tight  
You do not prize the blessings overmuch—  
  
You almost are too tired to pray to-night.  
  
But it is blessedness! A year ago  
I did not see it as I do to-day—  
We are so dull and thankless, and too slow  
To catch the sunshine till it slips away.  
And now it seems surpassing strange to me  
That while I wore the badge of motherhood,  
I did not kiss more oft and tenderly  
The little child that brought me only good.  
  
And if, some night, when you sit down to rest,  
You miss the elbow on your tired knee—  
  
This restless curly head from off your breast  
This lisping tongue that chatters constantly ;  
  
If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,  
And ne’er would nestle in your palm again,  
  
If the white feet into the grave had tripped—  
I could not blame you for your heartache then.  
  
I wonder that some mothers ever fret  
At their dear children clinging to their gown ;  
Or that the footprints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
If [ could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor—  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot  
And hear it patter in my house once more;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart to-day,  
To-morrow make a kite to reach the sky,  
There is no woman in God’s world could say  
  
She was more blissfully content than I!  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head !  
My singing birdling from its nest has flown—  
The little boy I used to kiss is—dead.

At little children clinging to their gown ;  
Or that the footprints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown.  
  
  
  
If I could find a little muddy boot,  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor;  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
And hear its patter in my home once more ;  
  
If I could mend a broken cart to-day  
To-morrow make a kite to reach the sky—  
There is no woman in God’s world could say  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
But, ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
Is never rumpled by a shining head;  
My singing birdling from its nest is fown—  
The little boy I used to kiss is dead !

You miss the elbow from your tired knee,  
  
This restless curling head from off your

Or that the footprints, when the days are wet,  
Are ever black enough to make them frown,  
If I could find a little muddy boot,  
  
Or cap, or jacket, on my chamber floor ;  
  
If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot,  
  
And hear its patter in my home once more ;

To-morrow make a kite to reach the sky,—  
  
There is no woman in God&#x27;s world could say  
  
She was more blissfully content than I.  
  
But ah! the dainty pillow next my own  
  
Is never rumpled by a shining head ;—
