<br/>
BY WITCH Hazel<br/>
<br/>
Every year I endeavor to make some improvement in my method of house cleaning. This spring, I made up my mind to adhere no longer to the poky old plan of my grandmother—which was to begin in the attic, and wind up in the cellar—but determined to strike out in another direction; and so, while the subject was rife in my mind, I set about executing my new plan at once although it was but the first of April, and the weather quite chilly and raw. In the first place, I had every stove moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the pictures removed from the walls, the curtains down, everything piled out on the back porch, and the carpetless halls crammed to overflowing with books, chairs, statues, feather dusters, vases, hair mattresses, parian brackets, and pillows; and while everything was in the wildest confusion, Frank came in with distended eyes.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;What on earth is all this, Hattie?&#x27; he exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Why Frank,&#x27; I replied, pausing in my efforts to reach a swaying cobweb, &#x27;we have commenced cleaning house,&#x27; and I lowered my broom, and looked straight in his face to see if he fully realized the importance of these words; but to my chagrin, he looked utterly indifferent, and brushing off some stray cobwebs which had floated down from the ceiling, on to his coat sleeve, asked impatiently, &#x27;Isn&#x27;t dinner ready?&#x27; &#x27;Dinner!&#x27; I cried; &#x27;I had no idea it was so late. I haven&#x27;t even commenced dinner yet.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Pretty state of affairs,&#x27; grumbled Frank. &#x27;I brought Ed Graham home with me.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Where is he?&#x27; I asked faintly.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;In the parlor,&#x27; replied Frank crustily. &#x27;The floor is bare; there is&#x27;n a chair or anything else for the man to sit on. I expect to find him seated on the piano. But come, Hattie,&#x27; he added, &#x27;what are you going to give us to eat?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;O, Frank,&#x27; I said coaxingly, thinking of my rought hair and the grease spot on my dress, &#x27;can&#x27;t you get your dinner down town to-day?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
Frank looked cross, and said he supposed he could, and went down to the parlor. I leaned over the banister, and when Frank opened the door, caught a glimpse of Ed roaming around the desolate room, shivering with his hands in his pockets. I watched them go through the hall heard Frank make some hateful remarks about women and house cleaning. He slammed the door violently, and I serenely resumed my sweeping, not in the least disturbed by Franks unconcealed annoyance and provoking manner. Frank was always a little unreasonable; and he was always bringing someone home to dinner when I least expected it.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, little Ted came toddling in, and wanted to help. As I was about to make a change of base, I took him with me down to the parlor, gave him a rag and a basin of water, and told him he might clean the floor. He sat down in one corner of the room, and with a face of most unearthly solemnity, at once commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Norah was up stairs, washing windows in the front chamber. Suddenly there came a loud crash, followed by a terrific yell; it sounded as if the whole house was tumbling down. &#x27;Heavens!&#x27; I exclaimed, &#x27;what can have happened.&#x27; I mounted the stairs, two steps at a time, and there beheld Norah lying full length on the floor, admist a debris of broken step ladder, pieces of glass and soap suds.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;What is the matter?&#x27; I cried to the groaning girl.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Shure, mum, I fell of the ladder the windy, an&#x27; cut myself most awful,&#x27; moaned the terrified girl.<br/>
<br/>
I helped the heavy girl to arise, bound up her lacerated arm, left her to pick up the fragments of glass and wood, and returned to the palor to find Ted scouring the piano legs with the scrubbing brush. I quickly relieved him from all further labor, bundled him up and sent him out in the yard to play.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Faith mum,&#x27; said Norah, standing in the door, &#x27;I feel so faint, an&#x27; an if I don&#x27;t make something strong I can&#x27;t work no more to-day.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Then make you some tea,&#x27; I replied.<br/>
<br/>
But Norah disdainfully said, &#x27;Shure I never could take tea; the very smill of it makes me sick.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Well, then, take some brandy,&#x27; I replied. Now I ought to have known better than to allow Norah to help herself to the brandy, but being in such a hurry to finish the parlor I could not conveniently stop. When I had occasion to go through the hall again, I paused and listened; I could hear nothing of Norah moving about, so once more I mounted the stairs. There, in the midst of the room, she sat in a rocking chair, a bucket of water stood before her, while she swayed laizily back and forth with the mop in her hand, which left a long trail of dirty water behind it.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Norah,&#x27; I cried, &#x27;didn&#x27;t I tell you to mop this floor?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Faith, mum, and I am doing it as fast as I can,&#x27; she replied.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;How can you mop sitting down?&#x27; I asked indignantly.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Get up out of that chair,&#x27; I said. Norah slowly arose and staggered against the wall.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Hie, mum, hie, yez see I&#x27;s very wake.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;You&#x27;re drunk, you had better say,&#x27; I replied.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Drunk, d&#x27;ye call it!&#x27; exclaimed Norah angrily, trying to look dignified; &#x27;drunk, after taking one tay-spoonful of brandy in a quart of water!&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Leave the room and go to bed,&#x27; I said indignantly; &#x27;to-morrow I shall dismiss you.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
After much arguing Norah finally decided to retire, and I was sole monarch of all the dirt and disorder. I surveyed the room in despair, but the word had to be done, and I seized the mop and soon finished. When I was about to descend the stairs, all tired and dirty, I heard Frank calling, &#x27;Hattie! where in the world are you?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Here,&#x27; I replied.<br/>
<br/>
Frank came up the uncarpeted stairs and tumbled over the mop. &#x27;Confound it!&#x27; he cried &#x27;the house is as dark as Egypt? Well,&#x27; he went on, &#x27;are we going supperless as well as dinnerless?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;There is no fire made,&#x27; I said, &#x27;and Norah is drunk, and I am tired to death; and—and&#x27; here I burst into tears, and sat down on the wet floor.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Why Hattie! what are you crying about! I&#x27;ll make the fire; never mind about the supper; had a capital dinner down town; come down stairs out of this damp room.&#x27; And Frank, who always got good and sorry the moment after he was cross, helped me off the floor, and down stairs into the kitchen. &#x27;Now don&#x27;t cry any more,&#x27; he said wiping the tears from my cheeks with his handkerchief; sit down, and I&#x27;ll have a fire in two minutes.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Where is Ted?&#x27; he inquired, pausing between the vigorous puffs at the fire.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;I have not seen him all afternoon. I sent him out to play, and he hasn&#x27;t been in since,&#x27; I replied.<br/>
<br/>
Frank dropped the shavings and started out in search of him. I waited and waited, and shivered with the cold, but no Frank came. I sat in the stiff-backed chair and closed my eyes. The last thing I remembered was a violent nod which pretty nearly dislocated my neck.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Hattie!&#x27; I awoke with a start. Frank was shaking me.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;You will take your death of cold; you have been fast asleep.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Where is Ted? did you find him in the cistern?&#x27; I asked dreamily.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;No,&#x27; laughed Frank, &#x27;but about as bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar, asleep like his mother.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child; he was covered with coal dust from head to foot, and was black as a negro. Frank prepared supper, while I washed Ted&#x27;s face and hands.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;How can you finish your cleaning without Norah?&#x27; he inquired.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;I am sure I don&#x27;t see how I can,&#x27; I replied as the mountains of work arose in my troubled mind. &#x27;Norah must be sent away in the morning.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
We all ate heartily of our supper, notwithstanding the eggs were fried until they were so crisp that they would break into bits if you such much as looked at them, and the toast was burnt, and the coffee not half boiled; still as I was ravenously hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After we had cleared the table and piled the dishes away to be washed in the morning, we retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken until late in the morning. Norah was dismissed, Frank went to his office, and I to my cleaning. Frank had shaken the carpets, and the parlor floor being dry, I soon had it all tacked down; then moved the chairs in, and began to dust the mantle ornaments, but O horror! I let fall one of my loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand fragments. A very bad beginning of the day, I thought sorrowfully, picking up the pieces.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Mamma,&#x27; cried a shrill voice, &#x27;I&#x27;s all jess up.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Where are you Ted?&#x27; I called.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Here,&#x27; cried Ted.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;And where is &#x27;here;&#x27; you&#x27;re in some mischief I&#x27;ll be bound.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
I heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, and a great scrambling up the attic stairs. After I had thrown the shattered pieces of my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what he was doing. What a sight met my eyes? Ted was arrayed in my violet silk, pinned up in front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my best bonnet on his head. I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted went prancing round and round in the dust and dirt of the attic; then I started after him. Of course he ran, screaming and laughing. &#x27;Take care,&#x27; I cried, but too late; he fell from the top to the bottom of the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
Rip, rip, went my violet silk; bump, bump went Ted. I flew down to the bottom of the stairs, and picked up a little insensible heap of lace, ribbons, silk, and dirt. That fall saved Ted from a good whipping. I carried him down stairs, and sprinkled him profusely with water, and camphor, until he opened his eyes; then I examined my ruined clothes. My dress was a mass of cobwebs, grease, and dust; the front width was wretchedly torn with pins; my shawl and bonnet were crushed and torn. I put them all away with a sigh of regret, and turned my attention once more to the prepetrator of this terrible deed. Just then some one knocked at the back door. On opening it I found a stout German girl on the step; she talked so broken that I could scarcely understand her, but managed to comprehend enough to know that Frank had engaged her for me. I set her to work immediately to clearn the china closet, and returned to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I heard a terrible crash in the dining room. &#x27;Heavens!&#x27; I exclaimed; &#x27;what can have happened *now*? and rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping and unclasping her hands in a heart rending manner. No wonder. She had upset the table on which all my shining glass and china was placed. Everything was literally smashed to pieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My goblets, and tea set! My fruit stands! Was there ever such a poor afflicted mortal as I? Words fail me to express my feelings at that moment. I sat down, perfectly stunned, to witness the harrowing sight of all my superb dishes swept away.<br/>
<br/>
There came another knock at the door. This time an Irish girl made her appearance. I wonder if Frank intended to send a regiment to destroy my house. However, I took her in, and the first thing I told her to do was answer the door bell, which had rung twice. I peeped through the door, which was partly open, and saw two ladies, but could not distinguish who they were.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to see yez,&#x27; said Ann, giving the door a violent push against my head.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Go tell them to excuse me,&#x27; I said, and being very dizzy from the blow, I did not notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the sitting room door open, and as the ladies came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;O mortification!&#x27; I was all rags and dirt, but had become somewhat reconciled to my misfortunes by this time.<br/>
<br/>
When Frank cmae home to supper, the hall was very dark; Ann was putting down the door mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant, and in the darkness mistook the horrid girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed and ran, and fell over a chair. Frank tore round and swore; said he would rather be in bedlam than where a woman was cleaning house; wondered why I couldn&#x27;t have the hall lighted. To all this I made no reply, but smiled grimly, being so overwhelmed with my griefs, I did not care if Frank kissed every servant girl in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning the German girl left. Probably she was fearful she would counter my frowns again. Ann remained and we proceeded to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously begun by Ann, who succeeded charmingly in breaking the globes of the chandelier, and then upsetting my gold fish. I was exasperated at this. There lay my fish on the carpet, to say nothing of the water. I believe I shook or slapped the girl. I don&#x27;t remember which. Ann was astonished at seeing me fly into such a passion that she baked up against the window, and thrust her clumsy foot through my lace curtain. This was the grand finale. I burst into tears, and so did Ann. Ted, hearing the sobs, came running in, and not knowing what to make of it, joined in and swelled the chorus. Amidst one of our loudest wails, the street door suddenly opened, and in walked my aunt Thankful, with several dozen carpet bags and bundles, prepared evidently for a long visit.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;In the name of all that&#x27;s wonderful!&#x27; she shrieked, letting all her traps fall. &#x27;What has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded, or the house on fire?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
I made no reply, but sobbed heedlessly on.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Hattie!&#x27; cried aunt Thankful in an awful voice. &#x27;Answer me immediately. What is the matter?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;My lace curtain,&#x27; I gurgled out.<br/>
<br/>
Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat down on the floor and examined it. &#x27;Silly puss,&#x27; she mumbled. &#x27;I can darn that in ten minutes.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Yes, with blue stocking yarn,&#x27; I said, and began to laugh sarcastically, and then I laughed and laughed. Ann laughed, and Ted laughed. Poor Aunt Thankful stared at us in horror, and said:<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Good Heavens! they are all stark mad;&#x27; and jumping up off the floor, she seized my arm and dragged me into the bed room, and put me to bed, then went out and locked the door, and left me alone. I went to sleep. When I awoke Aunt Thankful was sitting by my bed sewing.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Aunt Thankful,&#x27; I said, &#x27;when did you come?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Yesterday morning,&#x27; she replied.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;What time is it now?&#x27; I inquired.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Three o&#x27;clock,&#x27; answered Aunt Thankful.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;I have slept several hours then,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Was I asleep when you came?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;I should rather think not: when I came you were crazy, and I put you to bed. You slept all the rest of the day and night until this blessed minute, and if you hadn&#x27;t been put to bed you would have been in the insane asylum now.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful glared at me and said:<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;If you laugh any more I will put you into the cellar, and feed you on bread and water for a week.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
This not being a pleasant prospect, I subsided.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;You are a precious woman to clean house,&#x27; continued she. &#x27;I should have tought a child would know better than to commence in the attic and go down. Don&#x27;t know you that after you get through with the down stairs the dirt from the attic will make it dirtier than ever?&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;I never thought of that,&#x27; I answered meekly.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;And then to begin when it&#x27;s cold enough to freeze. It&#x27;s a wonder you didn&#x27;t have the lung fever, or something worse,&#x27; went on Aunt Thankful.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;I must get up and clean the attic,&#x27; I said.<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;No you won&#x27;t,&#x27; said Aunt Thankful, &#x27;for I cleaned it myself.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;Well, there are the rest of the carpets to put down.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;They&#x27;re all down.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;And the pictures.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
&#x27;All hung.&#x27;<br/>
<br/>
I gave a great sigh of relief. What would I have done if it had not been for Aunt Thankful! She had accomplished in one day what it would have taken me a week to perform; but then I never could bob round like Aunt Thankful; she seems to be made of wire. I have learned since then to take Aunt Thankful&#x27;s advice, never to commence cleaning until the weather is warm, and never to commence at the wrong end of the house.<br/>
<br/>
But it was such a mortification to think that my new plan was a total failure.—*Hearth and Home*.</td></tr></table></div><hr />

water stc od be ure her, while she swayed lazily<br/>
back and forth with the mop in her hand,<br/>
which left a long trail of dirty water behind<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
“Norah,” I cried, “didn’t I tell you to<br/>
mop this floor ?”<br/>
<br/>
* Faith, mam, and I’m doin’ it as fast as |<br/>
can,” she replied,<br/>
<br/>
“How can you mop<br/>

Leave the room and go to bed,” I said<br/>
yoantly; “to-morrow I shall dismiss<br/>
you,”<br/>
<br/>
After much arguing Norah finally decided<br/>
to retire, and J was left sole monarch of ail<br/>
the dirt and disoider, I surveyed the room<br/>
for a while in despair, but the work had to be<br/>

Frank came up the uncarpeted stirs ana<br/>

ccied, “ why is this house asdark as Egypt ?”<br/>
<br/>
&quot;he went on, “ are we to go supper-<br/>

<br/>
‘There is no fire made,” I said, “ and<br/>

<br/>
‘Why, Hattie! Hattie! what are you<br/>

about the supper; had a capital dinner down<br/>

<br/>
orry the moment after he was cross,<br/>
helped me up off the floor, and down stairs<br/>
into the kitchen, “Now don’t cry any<br/>

cheeks with his handkerchief; “sit down,<br/>

<br/>
was to answer the door bell, which had rung |<br/>
twice. I peeped through the door, which |<br/>
was partly open, and saw two ladies, but<br/>
could nut distinguish who they were.<br/>
<br/>
“Mum, there are two wimmen as wants|<br/>
to see yez,” said Ann, giving the doora<br/>
violent push against my head.<br/>
<br/>
“ Go tell them to excuse me,” I said ; and<br/>
being very dizzy from the blow, I failed to<br/>
notice that Ann, io her stupidity, had left<br/>
the sitting room door wide open, and as the}<br/>
ladies came out of the parlor, they saw me<br/>
plainly.<br/>
<br/>
“O mortification ! I was all rage and<br/>
dirt, but had become somewhat reconciled<br/>
to my misfortunes by this time.<br/>
<br/>
When Frank came up to supper, the hall<br/>
was very dark; Ann was putting down the<br/>
door mat. Frank forgot all about the new<br/>
servant, and in the darkness mistook the<br/>
horrid Irish girl for me, and kissed her. Ann<br/>
screamed and ran, and fell over a chair.<br/>
Frenk tore round and swore; said he would<br/>
rather be in vbedlam than where a woman<br/>
was cleaning house; wondered why |<br/>
cou dn’t have the hall lighted. ‘To ail this I<br/>
made no reply, but smiled grimly. Being<br/>
so overwhelmed with my griefs, 1 did not<br/>
care if Frank kissed every servant girl in<br/>
the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning the German girl left.<br/>
Probably she was fearful she would encoun-<br/>
ter my frowns again. Ann rem ined, and<br/>
we proceeded to finish our havoc. The day<br/>
was gloriously begun by Ann, who succeed-<br/>
ed charmingly in breaking the globes of the<br/>
chandelier, and then upsetting my gold fish.<br/>
I was exasperated at this. There lay my fish<br/>
on the oarpet, to say nothing of the water.<br/>
I believe I shook or slapped the girl, I don’t<br/>
remember which. Ann was so astonished at<br/>
seeing me fly into such a passion that she<br/>
backed up against the window, and thrust<br/>
her clumsy foot through my lace curtain.<br/>
This was the grand finale. I burst into<br/>
tears, and so did Ann. ‘Ted, hearing the<br/>
sobs, came running in, and not knowing<br/>
what to make of it, joined in and swelled<br/>
the chorus. Amidst one of our longest and<br/>
loudest wails, the street door suddenly flew<br/>
open, and in walked my aunt Thankful, with<br/>
several dozen carpet bags and bundles, pre-<br/>
pared evidently fer a long visit.<br/>
<br/>
“In the name of all that’s wonderfu<br/>
she shrieked, letting all her traps fall.<br/>
“What has tappened? Is Frank dead.<br/>
Ted scalded, or the houwe on fire ?”<br/>
<br/>
I made vo reply, but sobbed heedlessly<br/>
<br/>
1&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
on.<br/>
“ Hattie!” cried auyt Thankful in an<br/>
awful voice. “Answer me immediately.<br/>
What is the matter?”<br/>
<br/>
“ My lace curtain,” I gurgied out.<br/>
<br/>
Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat<br/>
<br/>
dowwiaii the floor and examined it. “ Silly<br/>
| poscrthe mumbled. “Ioan darn that in<br/>
nm minutes.”<br/>
<br/>
* Yes, with blue stocking yarn,” I said,<br/>
and began to laugh sarcastically, and then |<br/>
laughed, and laughed. Ann laughed, and<br/>
Ted laughed. Poor Aunt Thankful stared<br/>
at us in horror, and said :<br/>
<br/>
“Good Heavens! they are all stark<br/>
mad;” and jumping up off the floor, she<br/>
svized my arm and dragged me intu the bed<br/>
room, and put me to bed, then went our and<br/>
locked the door, and left me alone. I went<br/>
to sleep. When I awoke Aunt Thankful<br/>
was sy my bed sewing.<br/>
<br/>
“ Aunt Thankful,” I said, “ when did you<br/>
come ?”<br/>
<br/>
“ Yesterday morning,” she replied.<br/>
<br/>
“ What time is it now?” I inquired.<br/>
<br/>
“ Three o&#x27;clock,” answered Aunt Thank-<br/>
ful.<br/>
“I have slept several hours, then,” I said.<br/>
“ Was Lasleep when you came? ”<br/>
<br/>
“ ] should rather think Cf when I came<br/>
you were crazy, and I put You to bed. You<br/>
slept all the rest of the day and night until<br/>
this blessed minute, and if you hadn’t been<br/>
put to bed you would have been in the in-<br/>
sane asylum now.”<br/>
I began to laugh.<br/>
at me and said : :<br/>
“If you laugh any more I will put you in<br/>
the cellar, and feed you on bread and water<br/>
for a week.”<br/>
<br/>
This not being a pleasant prospect, I sub-<br/>
sided. °<br/>
<br/>
“You are a precious woman to clean house,”<br/>
continued she. “# should have thought a<br/>
child would know better than to commence<br/>
to clean right in the middle of the Louse.<br/>
You should commence in the attis and go<br/>
lown. Don’t you know that after you get<br/>
through with the down stairs the dirt from<br/>
the attic will make it all dirtier than ever ?”<br/>
<br/>
“I never thought of that,” I answered,<br/>
meekly. .<br/>
<br/>
“ And then to begin when it’s cold enough<br/>
to freeze. It’s a wonder you didn’t have the<br/>

Aunt<br/>

“I must get up and clean the attic,” I<br/>
said.<br/>

“No, you won&#x27;t,” said Aunt Thankful,<br/>
“ for I g@eaned it myself.”<br/>
<br/>
“ Weill, there are the rest of the carpets<br/>
to put down.”<br/>

Chaokful! She had accomplished<br/>

like Aunt Thankful; she seems to be made<br/>

Aunt Thankful’s advice, never to commence<br/>

never to commence at the wrong end of the<br/>

that my new plan was a total failure.<br/>

1; V WITCH HAZEL<br/>
Every year I endeavor to make some<br/>
improvement in my method of house<br/>
cleaning. This spring, I made up my<br/>
mind to adhere no longer to the poky<br/>
old plan of my grandmother? which was<br/>
to begin in the attic, and wind up in the<br/>
ocnar ? but determined to strike out io<br/>
another directibn ; and so, while the<br/>
subject was rife in my mind, I set about<br/>
executing my new projects at once, al­<br/>
though it wa? but the first of April, and<br/>
&#x27;he weather quite chilly and raw. In<br/>
the tirnt place, I bad every Hove moved<br/>
out, then every carpet taken up. all the<br/>
pictures removed from the walls, the<br/>
curtains down, everything piled out on<br/>
the back porch, and the carpetless balk<br/>
crammed to overflowing with books,<br/>
chair*, leather-dusters, vases hair-mat­<br/>
treses, parian brackets, and pillowsj<br/>
and while everything was in the wildest<br/>
confusion. Frank came in with distended<br/>
eyes.<br/>
&quot;What on farth in hII this. Hattie?<br/>
be exclaimed.<br/>
&quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing in<br/>
my efiorts to rea:h a swaying cobweb,<br/>
&quot;we have commenced cleaning house,<br/>
and I lowered my broom, and looked<br/>
straight in his face to see if he fully<br/>
realized the importance of these words ;<br/>
but to my chagrin, he looked utterly in­<br/>
different, and brushing off some stray<br/>
cobwelie which bad floated down from<br/>
the ceiling f&gt;n to his coat-sleeve, a^ked<br/>
impatiently, &quot;Isn&#x27;t dinner ready?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Dinner!&quot; I cried ; &quot;1 bad no idea it<br/>
was so late. I have n&#x27;t even com­<br/>
menced dinner yet.<br/>
? Pretty state of affairs,&quot; grumble]<br/>
Frank. &quot;1 brought Ed. Graham home<br/>
with me.&quot;<br/>
?Where is be?&quot; 1 asked faintly.<br/>
In the parlor,&quot; replied Frank, crust­<br/>
ilv. The floor is bare; there isn&#x27;t a<br/>
chair or any thing else lor the man to<br/>
sit on 1 expect I&#x27;ll find him seated on<br/>
the piano. But come, llattie,&#x27; he add­<br/>
ed, &quot;what are you going to give us to<br/>
eat ?&quot;<br/>
&quot;O, Frank,&quot; I said, coaxingly, think­<br/>
ing of my rough hair and the grease<br/>
spot on my dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your<br/>
dinner down-town to-day ?&#x27;<br/>
Frank looked cross, and said he sup­<br/>
posed he could, and went down to the<br/>
parlor. 1 leaned over the banister, and<br/>
when Frank opened the door, caught a<br/>
&quot;limpse of Ed. roaming around the<br/>
desolate room, shivering, with his hands<br/>
in his pockets. 1 watched them go<br/>
through the hall, and heard Frank<br/>
making some hateful remark about<br/>
women and house cleaning. He slam­<br/>
med the door violently, anil I serenely<br/>
resumed my sweeping, not in the least<br/>
disturbed by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed an­<br/>
novance anil provoking manner, rran ?<br/>
was always a little unreasonable ; and<br/>
he was always bringing somebody home<br/>
to dinner wlien I least expected it.<br/>
Just then, little Ted came toddling in,<br/>
and wanted to help. As I was about to<br/>
make a change of base, I took mm<br/>
with me down to the parlor, gave him<br/>
a rag and a basin of water, and told him<br/>
he might clean the floor. He sat down<br/>
in one corner of the room, and with a<br/>
face most unearthly, at once commenced<br/>
a vigerous scrubbing. Norah was up­<br/>
stairs, washing wincows in the front<br/>
chamber. Suddenly there came aloud<br/>
crash followed by a terrible yell ; it<br/>
sounded as if the whole house was<br/>
tumbling down. &quot;Heaven. 1 ex­<br/>
claimed, &quot;what can have happened.<br/>
1 mounted the stairs, two steps at a time<br/>
and there beheld Norah lying full<br/>
length ou the floor, amidst a debris of<br/>
broken step-ladder, pieces of glass, and<br/>
soapsuds. ,<br/>
&quot;What is the matter? 1 cried to the<br/>
o?roaning girl. . , , , ,<br/>
&quot;Shure, mum, I fell off the the ladder<br/>
agin the windy, an cut myself most<br/>
awful,&quot; moaned Norah.<br/>
1 helped the heavy girl to arise,<br/>
bound up her lacerated arm, left her to<br/>
pick up the fragments of glass and<br/>
wood, and returned to the parlor, there<br/>
to find Ted scouring the piano-legs with<br/>
the scrubbing-brush. 1 quickly re­<br/>
lieved him from all further labor, bun­<br/>
dled him up, and sent him out into the<br/>
vard to play.<br/>
&quot;Faith, mum,&quot; said Norah, standing<br/>
in the door, &quot;1 feel so faint, an&#x27; if I don t<br/>
be takiu&#x27; something ?lrong I cant<br/>
work no more to-day.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Then make your-elf some tea, l<br/>
reV,ut Norah disdainfully said, &quot;.Shure<br/>
1 never could stomach tajr; the very<br/>
smell of it makes me sick. . ? ,<br/>
&quot;Well, then, take some brandy, i<br/>
replied. Now, I ought to have known<br/>
better than to allow Norah to help her­<br/>
self to the brandy, but Wing in such a<br/>
hurrv to finish the parlor I could not<br/>
conveniently stop. When I had occasion<br/>
to go through the hall again, I paused<br/>
and listened ; I could hear nothing of<br/>
i Norah moving about, so once more I<br/>
mounted the stairs. There, in the mid­<br/>
dle of the room, she sat in a rockyig­<br/>
chair, a bucket of water stood before her,<br/>
while she swayed lazily back and forth<br/>

&quot;Faith, mum, and I&#x27;m doin&#x27; it as fast<br/>

we to go supperless as well as dinner­<br/>
leee ?<br/>
&#x27; fhere is no fire made, I taid, &quot;and<br/>
Norah is drunk, and I am tired to death;<br/>
and? and ? &quot; here I burst into tears,<br/>
and sat down on the wet floor.<br/>
&#x27;Why, Ilattie! Hattie! what are<br/>
you crying about ? I&#x27;ll make the tire ;<br/>
never mind about supper; had a capi­<br/>
tal dinner down town ; comedown stairs<br/>
out of this damp room.&quot; And Frank,<br/>
who always got good and sorry the<br/>
moment after he was cross, helped me<br/>
up off the floor, and down stairs into<br/>
the kitchen. &quot;Now don&#x27;t cry any<br/>
more,&quot; he said, wiping my tear-bedewed<br/>
cheeks with his handkerchief; &quot;sit<br/>
down, and 1 11 have a fire in two min­<br/>
utes.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where&#x27;s Ted ?&quot; he inquired, pausing<br/>
for breath between the vigorous nutfs at<br/>
the fire.<br/>
&quot;1 haven&#x27;t Seen him all the after­<br/>
noon. I sent him out to play and he<br/>
hasn&#x27;t been in the house since,&quot; I re­<br/>
plied.<br/>
Frank dropped the shavings and<br/>
started out in search of him. I waited<br/>
and waited, and shivered with the cold,<br/>
but no Frank came. I sat in the stifl­<br/>
backed chair and closed my eyes. The<br/>
last thing I remembered was a violent<br/>
not! which prettv nearly dislocated my<br/>
neck.<br/>
&quot;Hattie!&quot; [ awoke with a start.<br/>
Frank was shaking me.<br/>
&quot;You will take your death of cold;<br/>
you have been fast asleep.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where was Ted? did you find him<br/>
in the cistern ?&#x27;&#x27; I asked dreamily.<br/>
&quot;No, &#x27;, laughed Frank, &quot;but &quot; just<br/>
about as bad; the j&gt;Or fellow was in<br/>
the coal-cellar, asleep like his mother.&#x27;&#x27;<br/>
I rubbed my eves and looked at the<br/>
child ; he was covered with coal-duet<br/>
from his head to his feet, and as black<br/>
as a negro. Frank prepared supper<br/>
while I washed Ted&#x27;s face and hands.<br/>
&quot;How can you finish your cleaning<br/>
without Norah f he inquired.<br/>
&quot;I am sure I don&#x27;t flee how 1 can,&#x27;&#x27; 1<br/>
replied, as the mountains of work arose<br/>
in my troubled mind. &quot;Norah must be<br/>
sent away in the morning.&quot;<br/>
We all ate heartily of our supper,<br/>
notwithstanding the &quot;eggs were trie !<br/>
until they were so crisp and brittle that<br/>
they broke into bits if you so much as<br/>
looked at them, and the&quot; toast was burnt,<br/>
and the coffee not half boiled; still, as<br/>
I was ravenously hungry, it all tasted<br/>
pretty good. Alter we had cleared the j<br/>
table and piled the dishes awav to be<br/>
willed in the morning, we retired, anil<br/>
being so fatigued I did not awaken until<br/>
a late hour in the morning Norah<br/>
was dismissed, Frank went to hisotlice,<br/>
and I to my cleaning. Frank had the<br/>
carpeta shaken, and the parlor tloor<br/>
being dry, 1 soon had it all tacked down;<br/>
then moved the chairs in, and began to<br/>
dust the mantel ornaments, but, O hor­<br/>
ror! I let fall one of my loveliest vases<br/>
and shivered it into a thousand frag­<br/>
ments. A very bad beginning of the<br/>
day, I thought sorrowfully, picking up<br/>
the pieces.<br/>
&quot;Mamma, &#x27; cried a shrill voice, &quot;Is<br/>
all jess up.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where are you, Ted?&quot; I called<br/>
&quot;Here,&#x27;&#x27; cried Ted.<br/>
&quot;And where is &#x27;here&#x27; ; you&#x27;re in so ne<br/>
mischief, I&#x27;ll be bound.&#x27;<br/>
I heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, ami a<br/>
great scrambling up the attic stairs.<br/>
Atter 1 had thrown the shattered pieces<br/>
of my vase away, I ran up stairs to see<br/>
what he was doing. What a sight met<br/>
my eyes! Ted was arrayed in my vio­<br/>
let silk, pinned up in front, and trailing<br/>
far behind on the tloor, my white lace<br/>
shawl around his shoulders, and my<br/>
best bonnet on his head. I stood trans­<br/>
fixed for a moment, while Ted went<br/>
prancing round and round in the dust<br/>
and dirt of the attic; then I started after<br/>
him. Of course he ran, screaming and<br/>
laughing. &quot;Take care !&quot; I cried, but<br/>
too late; he fell from the top to the bot­<br/>
tom of the stairs.<br/>
Rip, rip, went my violet silk , bump,<br/>
bump, went Ted. &quot; I flew down after<br/>
him with my heart in my mouth, and<br/>
picked up a little insensible heap of<br/>
lace, ribbons, silk, and dirt. That fall<br/>
saved Ted a good whipping. 1 carried<br/>
him down stairs, and sprinkled him pro­<br/>
fusely with water, camphor, and eau&#x27;d*­<br/>
colonge , until he opened his eyes; then I<br/>
examined my ruined clothes.&quot; My dress<br/>
was a mass of grease, cobwebs, and<br/>
dust; the front width was wretchedly<br/>
torn with the pins; my shawl and bon­<br/>
net were crushcJ and torn. I put them<br/>
all away with a sigh of regret, and<br/>
turned my attention once more to the j<br/>
perpetrator of this terrible deed. Just<br/>
then some one knooked at the hack &#x27;<br/>
tloor. On opening it, I tound a stout&#x27;<br/>
German girl on the step; she talked so1<br/>
broken that I could ecracelv understand |<br/>
her, but managed to comprehend enough<br/>
to know that Frank had engaged her<br/>
for me. I set her to work immediately !<br/>
to clean the china closet, and returned !<br/>
to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I<br/>
heard a terrible crash in the dining­<br/>
room. &quot;Heavens!&quot; I exclaimed; &quot;what<br/>
can have happened now f and rushing<br/>
out I found the frightened girl clasping<br/>
and unclasping her hands in a heart­<br/>
rending manner. No wonder. -S.&#x27;ie<br/>
had npset the table on which all my<br/>
sbiuing glass and china was placed.<br/>
Every thing was literally smashed K&gt;<br/>
i)iec-?s. My beautiful celery glasses !<br/>
My goblets and tea-set ! My fruit<br/>
6tands! Was there ever such a poor<br/>
afflicted mortal as I ? Words fail me<br/>
to express my feelings at that moment.<br/>
I sat down, perfectly stunned, to witness<br/>
the harrowing sight of all my superb<br/>
dishes swept away.<br/>
There came another knock at the<br/>
door. This time an Irish girl made<br/>
her appearance. I wondered if Frank<br/>
intended to send a regiment to destroy<br/>
my house. However, I took her in,<br/>
and the first thing I told her to do was<br/>
to answer the door-bell, which had rung<br/>
twice. I peeped through the door, which<br/>
was partly open, an! saw two ladies,<br/>
but could not distinguish who they<br/>
were.<br/>
&quot;Mum. there is two witnmen as wants<br/>
to see yez,&quot; said Ann, giving the door<br/>
a violent push against my head.<br/>
&quot;Go tell them to excuse me,&quot; I said :<br/>
and being very dizzy from the blow, I<br/>
failed to notice that Ann, in her stupid­<br/>
ity, had left the sitting-room door wide<br/>
open, and as the ladies cams out of the<br/>
parlor, they saw me plainly.<br/>
&quot;0 mortifiaation ! &#x27; I &quot;was all rags<br/>
and dirt, btrt had become somewhat<br/>
reconciled to my misfortunes by this<br/>
time.<br/>
Whea Frank came up to sapper the<br/>

ing me fly into such a passion , that sne<br/>
backed up against the window and<br/>
thrust her clumsy foot through my lace<br/>
curtain. This was the grand finale. I<br/>
burst into tears, and ?&gt;did Ann .<br/>

not knowing what to make of it. jomaj<br/>
in and swelled the chorus. Amidst one<br/>

I made 110 reply, but sobbed hcedlet<br/>

What is the matter?&#x27;&#x27;<br/>

that in ten minutes.&quot; # ? .<br/>
&quot;Yes, with blue stocking yarn,<br/>
said, and began to laugh sarcastically,<br/>
anil then 1 laughed. Ann<br/>
Ted laughed. Poor Aunt Thankful<br/>
stared at us in horror and said:<br/>
&quot;(iood Heavens&#x27; they are all *&#x27;*rk<br/>
mad and jumping up off the floor<br/>
she seized mv arm and dragged me into<br/>
the bed-room, and put me to bed, then<br/>
went out and locked the door, and left<br/>
me alone. I went to sleep. When<br/>
awoke Aunt Thankful was sittingjby<br/>
mv bed sewing. . &#x27; .<br/>
&quot;Aunt Thankful, I *aid, when did<br/>
vou come?&quot; .... ?? ?<br/>
&quot;Yesterday morning, she replied.<br/>
&quot;What time is it now .&#x27; 1 inquired.<br/>
&quot;Three o&#x27;clock.&#x27; nnswerel Aunt<br/>
Thankful. . , . ,<br/>
&quot;1 have slept several hours, then, i<br/>
said. &quot;Was 1 asleep when you came<br/>
&quot;I should rather think not; when 1<br/>
came vou were crazy, and 1 put you to<br/>
be?l. Vou slept all the rest of the day<br/>
and night until this blessed minute, and 1<br/>
if vou hadn&#x27;t been put to bed you<br/>
would have been in the insane asylum<br/>
now. , . . .<br/>
1 began to laugh. Aunt Ihankiui<br/>
glared at me and said<br/>
&quot;If you laugh any more 1 will put you<br/>
in the cellar, and feed you on bread and<br/>
water for a week. &#x27;<br/>
This not heing a pleasant prospect 1<br/>
subsided.<br/>
&quot;You are a precious woman to clean<br/>
house,&quot; continued she. &quot;1 should have<br/>
thought a child would know better than<br/>
to commence to clean right in the mid­<br/>
dle of the house. You should com­<br/>
mence in the attic and go down. Don t<br/>
vou know that after you get through<br/>
with the down stairs the dirt from the<br/>
attic will made it all dirtier than ever?&#x27;&#x27;<br/>
&quot;I never thought of that,&quot; I answered,<br/>
meekly. . . . . .<br/>
&quot;And then to begin when its cold<br/>
enough to freeze. It&#x27;s a wonder you<br/>
didn t have the lung lever, or something<br/>
worse,&quot; went on Aunt Thankful. ^ (<br/>
&quot;1 must get up and clean the attic,<br/>
&quot;No you won&#x27;t,&#x27; said Aunt Thankful,<br/>
&quot;for I cleaned it myself.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, there are the rest of the car­<br/>
pets to put down.<br/>
&quot;They&#x27;re all down.&quot;<br/>
&quot;And the pictures.&#x27;<br/>
? &quot;All hung.&quot;<br/>
I gave a great sigh of relief. W hat<br/>
would 1 have done if it had not beeu<br/>
for Aunt Thankful! She had accom­<br/>
plished in one day what it would have<br/>
taken me a week to perform ; l?ut then<br/>
1 never could bob around like Aunt<br/>
Thankful ; she seems to he made of wire.<br/>
I have learned since then to take Aunt<br/>
Thankful s advice, never to commcnce<br/>
cleaning until the weather is warm, and<br/>
never to commence at the wrong end of<br/>
the house.<br/>
But it was such a mortification to<br/>
think that my new plan was a total<br/>
failure</td><td style="width: 50%; max-height: 75%; margin: auto; display: block;"><img src="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/wvu_deforest_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn84026847%2F0041566512A%2F1871041201%2F0347.jp2/pct:9.370200,2.654219,40.909767,95.324913/!600,600/0/default.jpg" /></td></tr></table></div><hr />

SBY WITCH HAZEL.<br/>
(From the Home Journal.J<br/>
Every year I endeavor to make some im­<br/>
&#x27; prove ment in my method of house-cleaning.<br/>
S&#x27;This spring. I made up my mind to adhere<br/>
, no longer to the poky old plan of my grand­<br/>
mo&#x27;ther-wh}h was. to begin in the attic.<br/>
. nd wind up in the cellar-but determined<br/>
to strike out in another direction; and so,<br/>
whiile the subject was rife in my mind, I set<br/>
about executing my new projects at once,<br/>
a although it was but the first of April, and the<br/>
weather quite chilly and raw, In the first<br/>
I plice, I had every stove moved out, then<br/>
every carpet taken up, all the pictures re­<br/>
moved from the walls, the curtains down,<br/>
everything piled out on the back porch,<br/>
and the carpetless balls crammpd to over­<br/>
tlowhi with bos i statues, feather­<br/>
ets and pillows ; and whire everyting was<br/>
in the wildest confusion, Frank came in<br/>
with distended eyes.<br/>
&#x27;What on earth is all, this, Hattie ?&quot; he<br/>
exclaimed.<br/>
&quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing in my<br/>
efforts to re.ach a swaying cobweb. &quot;we<br/>
have commenced cleaning house,&quot; and I<br/>
lowered my broon, and looke I straght in<br/>
his fa;r&#x27;e to see if he fully realized the imn­<br/>
poIranuce of thlese words ; but to my cha­<br/>
grin, he loaoked utterly indiffe-rent, and<br/>
brushing off some stray cobwebs which had<br/>
. flouted downa from the ceailing on to his cot­<br/>
slheeve, iaakd implatiently, &#x27;Is ;n&#x27;t dinner<br/>
ready ?&quot; &quot;Dl)ier!&#x27;&quot; I cried; &quot;*I had no ii<br/>
idea it nitas .o late. I have n&#x27;t even com- a<br/>
mencd di.nner yet.&#x27;&quot; h<br/>
&quot;lPretty state of affairs,&quot; grumbled<br/>
Frank, &quot;I brought Ed. Graham home with<br/>
me.&quot; d<br/>
&quot;Where is he ?&quot; I asked, faintly.<br/>
•&quot;In the parlor,&quot; replied Frank. crustily. a<br/>
&quot;The floor is bare; there is n&#x27;t a chair or<br/>
anything else for the tan to sit on. I ex- 01<br/>
pect I&#x27;ll find him seated on the piano. But<br/>
come, Hattie,&quot; he&#x27; added, &quot;what are you I<br/>
going to give us to eatt&quot; P&#x27;<br/>
&quot;O, Frank,&quot; I said, coaxingly, thinking d<br/>
of my rough hair and the grease-spot on<br/>
my dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your ditner down- st<br/>
town to day ?&quot;&#x27;<br/>
Frank looked cross, and said he supposed<br/>
he could, and went down to tht parlor. I<br/>
leaned over the banister, and thea Frank je<br/>
opened the door, caught a glimpse of Ed.<br/>
roaming around the desolate rdºm, shiver­<br/>
ing, with his hands in his pockets. I<br/>
watched them go through the hall, and mi<br/>
heard Frank making some hatsful remarks<br/>
about women and house-chasing. He r<br/>
slammed the door violently, an] I serenely II<br/>
resumed my sweeping, not in the least dis- as<br/>
turbed by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed annoyance do<br/>
and provoking manner. Frank was always we<br/>
a little -unreasonable , and he was alwayi fr<br/>
bringing somebody home to dianer when I -m<br/>
least expected it. an<br/>
Just then, little Ted came toddling in, ta<br/>
and wanted to help. As I vas about to pr<br/>
make a change of base, I took Jim with me dii<br/>
down to the pal.r, gave hima rag and a Of<br/>
basin of water, and told him he<br/>
the room. and with a ace o os umear y<br/>
solemnity, at once commencel a vigorous bu<br/>
scrubbing. Norah was up stairs, washing wi<br/>
windows in the front chambeo. Suddenly a<br/>
there came a loud crash, followed by a t or- sil<br/>
riSc yell; it sounded as if the whole house go<br/>
was tumbling down. &quot;Heawuns!&quot; I ex- a<br/>
claimed, &quot;what can have happened.&quot; I c<br/>
mounted the stairs, two steps ¢ atime, and op<br/>
there beheld Norah lying fall ength on the ila<br/>
floor, amidst a debris of broker step-ladder, gr<br/>
pieces of glass, and soapsuds.&#x27; e<br/>
&quot;What is the matter ?&quot; I cried to the se<br/>
<br/>
}growaning girl. . I<br/>
,&quot;Shure, I.a, I fell of it ladder agin t<br/>
the windy, an&#x27; out myseelftost awful,&quot; p<br/>
moaned Norah.<br/>
I helped the heavy girl t arise, bound q<br/>
up her ,lacerated arm, left ir to pick up t<br/>
the fragments of ghss and rood, and re- a<br/>
turned to the parlor, thenr to find Ted e<br/>
scoring the piano-legs with the scrubbing- I<br/>
brash. I quickly relieved hinfrom all fur- Ii<br/>
ther labor, bundled him upsed sent him r<br/>
out in the yard to play. b<br/>
,-Faith, mum,&quot; said Norua. standlng in<br/>
the door, &quot;*I feel so faint, at if I don&#x27;t be b<br/>
tnkin somethin&#x27; strong I cat&#x27;t work no more t<br/>
to-day.&quot; b<br/>
,*Then make yourself some tea,&quot; I re­<br/>
plied. a<br/>
But Norah disdainfully id. &quot;Shure I I<br/>
never could stomach tay; the very smill of I<br/>
it makes mo sick,&quot;<br/>
&#x27;Well. then, take some Imady,&quot; I re­<br/>
plied. Now, I ought to have knowu better<br/>
than to allow Norab to hei herselfto the<br/>
brandy, but being in such a hurry to fish a<br/>
the parlor I could not coaveietly atop. a<br/>
When I had occasion to go through the<br/>
tall again, I passed and listened ; I could<br/>
bear nothing of Norah moving about, so<br/>
once mere I mounted the stairs. There, in<br/>
the middle of the room, she sat in a rock­<br/>
ing-chair, a bucket of water stood before<br/>
her, while she swayed lazily back and forth<br/>
with the mop in her hand, which left a long<br/>
trail of diity water behind it.<br/>
&quot;Norah!&quot; I cried, &quot;did n&#x27;t I tell you to<br/>

&quot;How can you finish your clh&#x27;aing. with<br/>
out Norah ?&quot; he inquired.<br/>
&quot;I am sure I do n&#x27;t :ee htow I ca&#x27;i.&quot; I<br/>
replied, as the mIountain of work arose in I<br/>
my troubled mind. &quot;&#x27;Norah must lit&#x27; sent1<br/>
away in the morning.&quot;<br/>
We all ate heartily of our supper, nittt<br/>
withstanding the eggs were fried until thue<br/>
were so crisp and brittle that thyv hrket ,<br/>
into bits if you so much as lot.ked at tlihen,<br/>
and the toast was burnt, and the colflte t it<br/>
half boiled. still, as I was ravenously huin­<br/>
gry, it all tasted pretty good. After we<br/>
had cleared the tabe&#x27; and piled the a<br/>
dishes away to be washed in the morning.<br/>
we retired, and being so fatigued I did not ti<br/>
awaken until a late hour in the morning. f,<br/>
Norah was dismissed, Frank went to his<br/>
office, and I to my cleaning. Frank lvad si<br/>
the carpets shaken, and the parlor floor be­<br/>
ing dry, I soon had it all tacked down ; i<br/>
then moved the chairs in, and began to tl<br/>
dust the mantel ornaments, but, 0 horror! ci<br/>
I let fall one of my loveliest vases and tl<br/>
shivered it into a thousand fragments. A ait<br/>
very bad beginning of the day, I thoulght at<br/>
sorowfully, picking up the pieces. tl<br/>
&quot;Mamma,&quot; cried a shrill voice, &quot;I&#x27;s all i,<br/>
jess up.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where are you, Ted ?&quot; I called. m<br/>
.&quot;Here,&quot; cried Ted.<br/>
&quot;And where is here; you&#x27;re inlsome t,,<br/>
mischief, 141 be bound.&quot; &quot;t<br/>
<br/>
I heard Ted&#x27;s bhuckling laugh, and a 0<br/>
great scrambling up the attic stairs After<br/>
I had thrown the shatterd pieces of my vase.<br/>
away, I ran up stairs to see what he was<br/>
doing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted &#x27;1<br/>
was arrayed in my violet silk. pinned up in<br/>
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, t4<br/>
*my white lace shawl around his shoulders,<br/>
and my best bonnet on his head. I stood<br/>
transfixed for a moment, while Ted went<br/>
prancing round and round in the dust an I<br/>
dirt of the attic; then I started after him. W<br/>
Of course he&#x27;ran, scrdaming and laughing. A<br/>
p, rap, went my violet sl; bump,,<br/>
bump, went Ted. I flew down after him<br/>
with my heart in my mouth, and picked up<br/>
a little insensible heap of lace, ribbons,<br/>
silk, and dirt. - That fall saved Ted from a w<br/>
good whipping, I carried him down stairs.<br/>
and sprinkled him profusely with water,<br/>
camphor, and eas-de-cologne, until he<br/>
opened his eyes; then I examined my ru­<br/>
ined clothes. My dress was a mass of<br/>
grease, cobwebs, and dust; the front width<br/>
was wretchedly torn with the pins; my<br/>
shawl and bonnet were crashed and torn.<br/>
I put them away with a sigh of grgret. and<br/>
turned my attention once more to the per­<br/>
petrator of this terrible deed. Just then<br/>
some one kbcked at the back door. On i<br/>
opeaing it. Lfound a stout German girlpn 1<br/>
the step ; she talked so broken that I could<br/>
scarcely understand her, but managed to<br/>
oprebend enough to know that Frank. t<br/>
had engaged her for me. I set her to work<br/>
immediately to clean the china closet, and<br/>
returned to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I<br/>
heard a terrible crash in the dinning-room.<br/>
*Heavena !&#x27;&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;what can have<br/>
happened now t?&quot; and rushing out I found<br/>
the frightened girl clasping and unclasping<br/>
her hands iua heart-rending m.anner. No<br/>
wonder. She had upset the table on which<br/>
all my shining glass and china was placed.<br/>
Everything waslitesrally amashed to pieces.<br/>
My beautiful elergy glasses. My goblet-,<br/>
and tea-set! My fruitstands! Was there<br/>
ever suck a poor afflicted&quot; mortal as I ?<br/>
Words fail_ me to express my feelings at<br/>
that moment. I sat down, perfectly stut­<br/>
at ed, to witness the harrowing sight of all<br/>
my suaerb dishes swept away.<br/>
There came another knock at the door.<br/>
Thistihme s.irish girl made her appearance.<br/>
I wtndted if Frank intended to send a<br/>
regiment to destroy my house. However,<br/>
I tOok her in, and the Mrst thing I told her<br/>
to do was to answer the door=bell. which<br/>
bad rang &#x27;twioe. I peeped through the<br/>
door, which was par.ly open, and saw ladies,<br/>
but could not distinguish who they were.<br/>
&#x27; &quot;ium, there is two wimmen as wants to<br/>
see yea,&quot;said A i, ving the door a vi­<br/>

and being very - dizzy fium the blow, I<br/>
failed to notie that Ann, in.her stupidity,<br/>
had left the sitting-room door open, and as<br/>
the ladies came out of the parlor, tlhey atw<br/>
,t ý &quot; mortifiation !&quot; I was all rags and<br/>
, dirt, but had become somewhat reconciled<br/>
I to my .mbforte by this time.<br/>
When FrM ame up to suppert the hall<br/>
was very dark; Ann was putting down the<br/>
doer-mat. Frank forgot all about the new<br/>
serve$t, and in the darkness mistook the<br/>
a beri Irish girl for me, and kissed her.<br/>
mlllaImsd and rasamnd fell over a chair,<br/>
F ak tore round and swore; said he would<br/>

fall one cf my loveliest va-es and shivered<br/>
it into a thousand fragments. A very<br/>
bad beginning of&#x27; the dav, I thought sor-<br/>
rowf&#x27;ully, picking up the pieces.<br/>

1 neara jeu s enucsnng<br/>
laugh, and a<br/>
great scrambling up the attic stair<br/>
After 1 had thrown the shattered p ieces<br/>
of my vase away, l ran up stairs to see<br/>
what he was doing. What a sight met my<br/>
eyes ? Ted wes arrayed tn my violet silk,<br/>
pinned up in frcrt, and trailing far beb&#x27;nd<br/>
on the floor, my white lace !-bawl around<br/>
his shoulders, and my best bonnet on his<br/>
head. 1 steed transfixed for a moment,<br/>
while Ted went pranr.ng round and round<br/>
in the dust aDd dirt ol the attic; then I<br/>
started after him. Of ccurse he ran.<br/>
sceraming and laughing. &#x27; Take care. 1<br/>
cried,&quot; but tco late ; he fell from the<br/>
top to the bottom of the stairs.<br/>
Hip, rip, went my violet silk; bump.<br/>
dirt.<br/>
That Jail saved Ted from a good<br/>
whippiDg. I carried him down stair?, and<br/>
tprinkled him profusely with water, and<br/>
camphor, until he opened his eyes ; then I<br/>
examined my ruined clothes, My dress<br/>
. was a mass of cobwebs, grease, and dust ;<br/>
; the front width was wretchedly torn with<br/>
j<br/>
!P; my hawl and Wnet were crushed<br/>
j and torn. I put them a,l away with a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sigh of regret, and turned my attention<br/>
once more to the prepetrator of this terri­<br/>
ble deed. Just then some one knocked at<br/>
the back door. (Ju opening it I found a<br/>
a stout German g rl on the step ; she<br/>
talked so broken that 1 could scarcely un­<br/>
derstand her, but managed to comprehend<br/>
enough to know that Frank had engaged<br/>
her for me, I set her to work immediate­<br/>
ly to clean the china closet, and returned<br/>
to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I heard a<br/>
terrible crash in the dining room. Hea­<br/>
vens 1&#x27; 1 exclaimed ; &#x27;what can have hap­<br/>
pened noic&#x27;f and rushing out 1 found the<br/>
frightened girl clasping and unclasping her<br/>
hands iu a heart rending manner. No won­<br/>
der. She had upset the table on which<br/>
all my shining glass and china was placed.<br/>
Kvery thing was literally siaa.hed to pieces.<br/>
My beautiful celery glasses! My goblets,<br/>
and tea set ! My fruit stands ! Was<br/>
there ever such a peer uliilcted mortal as<br/>
I &#x27;.&#x27; Words fail n.e to express my leelings<br/>
at that moment. I sat down, perfectly<br/>
stunned, to witness the harrowing sight<br/>
of all my superb dishes swept away.<br/>
There came another knock at the door.<br/>
This time an Irish girl made her appear­<br/>
ance. 1 wonder if F&#x27;ranV intended to send<br/>
a regiment to destroy my house. How­<br/>
ever, 1 took her iD, and the first thing 1<br/>
told her to do was answer the door bell,<br/>
which had rung twice. I peeped through<br/>
the door, which was partly op en, and saw<br/>
two ladies, but could not distinguish who<br/>
they were.<br/>
Mum, tncre are two wtmiuvn as want­<br/>
to see ye,&#x27; sa.d Ann. giving the door a<br/>
violent jej-h against my head.<br/>
&#x27; Go tell thctn to excuse u.e.&quot; I said :<br/>

at us in horror, and sa.d :<br/>
Good Heaven- ! they are all -lark<br/>
mad ; &#x27; and jumping up c ti the floor, she<br/>
-cued my arm and dragged me into the bed<br/>
room, and j.ut me to ltd. then went cut<br/>

went to sleep. When I awoke Aunt<br/>
Thankful was sitting by my led sewing.<br/>
Aunt Thankful.&quot; I -aid. when did you<br/>
ce me &#x27;<br/>
Yt-teiday morning,&quot; she re-plied.<br/>
What time is it now ? &#x27; I inquired.<br/>
Three, o&#x27;clock. answered Aunt Thank­<br/>
ful.&#x27; 1 have slept several hodls then.&quot; 1 .-aid.<br/>
Was I a-ieep when y ou came ? &#x27;<br/>
1 should rather tfiink not ; when I<br/>
earn? you were cray. and I put you to bed.<br/>
You s.tp t all the rc.-t o! the day and night<br/>
until this bles.-ed minute, and if you had n&#x27;t<br/>
been p.ut to bed you would have been ia<br/>
the insane a-ylum now.&quot;<br/>
1 began to laugh. Aunt &#x27;Thankful glared<br/>
at me and said :<br/>
If you laugh any more 1 will put you<br/>
into the cellar, and feed you on bread and<br/>
water for a week.&quot;<br/>
This not being a pleasant prosp ect. I sub­<br/>
sided.You ire a pTccious woman to clean<br/>
house.&#x27; continued she. 1 should have<br/>
thought a child would know better than to<br/>
commence in the attic and go down. Don&#x27;t<br/>
vou know that after you get through with<br/>
the down stairs the dirt from the attid will<br/>
make it dirtier than ever &#x27;.&#x27; &#x27;<br/>
I never thougat of that,&quot; 1 answered .<br/>
meekly.<br/>
&#x27; And then to begin w Leu it&#x27;s cold enough<br/>
to freeze. It&#x27;s a wonder you didu&#x27;t have<br/>
the lung fever, or something worse,&quot; went<br/>
on Aunt Thankful.<br/>
I must get up and cleau the attic.&quot; I<br/>
said.<br/>
No you won&#x27;t,&quot; said Aunt Thankful,<br/>
for I c. caned il myself.&quot;<br/>
Weil, there are the rj.-t of the carpets<br/>
to put down.&#x27;<br/>
They&#x27;re ali down.&#x27;<br/>
And the pictures.&#x27;<br/>
&#x27; All hung.&#x27;<br/>
I gave a great sigh of relief. What<br/>
would 1 have done if it had not been for<br/>
Aunt Thankful ! She had accomplished in<br/>
one day what it would have taken mo a<br/>
week t perform ; but then I never could<br/>
bob round like Aunt Thankful ; she seems<br/>
to be made of wire. I have learned since<br/>
then to take Aunt Thankfu&#x27;&quot;s advice, never<br/>
to commence cleaning until the weather is<br/>
warm, and never to commence at the wrong<br/>
end of the house.<br/>
But it was such a mortification to think<br/>
that my new plan was a total failure.<br/>

Every j-cir I endeavor to nitikoKomo Im­<br/>
provement in my mellioil of house clean­<br/>

ndlierc no longer to the poky old plnn of<br/>
my grandmother which was to hegln In<br/>
tho nttlc, and wind up In the cellar but<br/>
determined to striko out In another direc­<br/>
tion j ami so, while the subject was rlfo In<br/>
my uilnd, I set about executing my new<br/>
projects at once, although it was hut tho<br/>
liri.t or April, and the weather quite chilly<br/>
and raw. In tho first place I had every<br/>
stove, nioxcd out, then overy carpot taken<br/>
up, all tho pictures removed from the walls,<br/>
tho curtains down, everything piled out In<br/>
tho back porch, and tho carpctless halls<br/>
eramnjed to overflowing with books,<br/>
( halts, statues, feather-dusters, vases, hair<br/>
luatrcstes, parian brackets, and plllous;<br/>
aud whllo everything was In tho wildest<br/>
confusion, Prank camo In with distended<br/>
eyes.<br/>
&quot;What on earth Is all this, Ilattle?&quot; ho<br/>
exclaimed.<br/>
&quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing In my<br/>
efforts to reach a swaying cobweb, &quot;wo<br/>
have commenced to clean ;houso ;&quot; and I<br/>
lowered my broom, and looked ntraight<br/>
Into his face to sco If ho realized tho Im­<br/>
portance of theso words j but to my cha­<br/>
grin he looked utterly Indifferent; and<br/>
brushing off somo stray cobwebs which<br/>
had floated down from the celling on to his<br/>
coat sleovc, asked Impatiently, &quot;Isn&#x27;t din­<br/>
ner ready?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Dinner!&quot; I cried; &quot;I had no Idea it<br/>
was so late. I bavn&#x27;t even commenced<br/>
dinner yet.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Pretty statoofaffalrs,&quot;grumhlcd Frank.<br/>
&quot;I brought Ed Oraham homo with me.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where is ho?&quot; I asked faintly.<br/>
&quot;In tho parlor,&quot; replied Frank crustily.<br/>
&quot;Tho floor Is baro ; and there Isn&#x27;t a chair<br/>
or anything clso for tho man to sit on. I<br/>
oxpect I&#x27;ll find him seated ou the piano.<br/>
Hut come, Ilattla,&quot; ho added, &quot;what arc<br/>
you going to give us to cat T&quot;<br/>
&quot;O, Frank,&quot; I said coaxlngly, thinking<br/>
of my rough hair, aud tho groasespoton<br/>
my dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your dlnnerdown<br/>
town today?&quot;<br/>
Frank looked cross, and said he suppos­<br/>
ed ho could, and went down to the parlor.<br/>
I leaned over tho baluster, and when<br/>
Frank opened tho door, caught a glimpse<br/>
of Ed roaming around tho desolate room,<br/>
shivering with his hands In his pockets. I<br/>
watched them go through tho hall, and<br/>
beard Frank mako somo hateful remarks<br/>
about .women and houso-cleanlng, llo<br/>
slammed tho door violently, and I sereno­<br/>
ly resumed my sweeping not in tho least<br/>
dlstrubed by Frank&#x27;s uncoucealed annoy­<br/>
anco and provoking manner, Frank was<br/>
always a llttlo unreasonable ; and ho was<br/>
always bringing somebody homo to dinner<br/>
when I least expected It. Just then llttlo<br/>
Ted camo toddling in, and wanted to help.<br/>
As I was about to make a change, of base,<br/>
I took him with mo down to tho parlor,<br/>
gavo him a rag and a basin of water, and<br/>
told him ho might clean tho floor. Ho sat<br/>
down in ono corner of tho room, aud with<br/>
a f.ico of unearthly solemnity, at once<br/>
commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Norah<br/>
was up stairs washing windows In the front<br/>
chamber. Suddenly thero camo a loud<br/>
crai-h, followed by a terrific yell. It sound­<br/>
od as If tho wliolo house was tumbling<br/>
down. &quot;Ilea; ens I&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;what<br/>
can have hat period 1&quot; I mounted the<br/>
stairs, two steps at a time, and thcro beheld<br/>
Norah lying full length ou the I&#x27;oor, a­<br/>
midst a debris of broken step-ladder,<br/>
pieces of glass mid soapsuds,<br/>
&quot;What&#x27;s tho matter?&quot; I cried to tho<br/>
groaning girl.<br/>
&quot;Suromum, I fell off tho ladder agin<br/>
tho windy an&#x27; cut nieself most awful,&quot;<br/>
moaned Norah.<br/>
I helped tho heavy girl to arise, hound<br/>
up her lacerated arm, left her. to pick up<br/>
tho fragments of glass and wood, aud re­<br/>
turned to tho parlor, thero to And Ted<br/>
scouring tho planu-legs with tho scrubbing<br/>
brush. I quickly relieved him from all<br/>
fiirthor labor, bundled him up, and sent<br/>
lilm out In thu yard to play.<br/>
&quot;Faith, mum,&quot; said Norah, standing In<br/>
tho door, &quot;I feel so f.tlnt, an&#x27; If I don&#x27;t bo<br/>
taking Bomethln&#x27; strong, I can&#x27;t work no<br/>
more today,&quot;<br/>
&quot;Then make yourself somo toa,&quot; 1 ro­<br/>
plied.Hut Norah disdainfully said, &quot;Sure, I<br/>
nover could stomach lay j tho very smoll<br/>
of it makes mo sick,&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, then, tako some brandy,&quot; I re­<br/>
plied, Now I ought to hao known bel­<br/>
ter than to allow Norah to help herself to<br/>
tho brandy ; but bolng in such a hurry to<br/>
finish tho parlor, I could not conveniently<br/>
stop, When I had occasion to go through<br/>
the hall again, I paused and listened, I<br/>
mouutod the stairs. Therein tho mlddlo<br/>
of tho room, shu sat In a rocking chair I u<br/>
bucket of water stood before her, whllo<br/>
sha swayed lazily back and forth with tho<br/>
mop In her hand, which left a long trail of<br/>
dirty water behind it.<br/>
&quot;Norah I&quot; I cried, &quot;didn&#x27;t I tell you to<br/>

When I was about to doscend the stairs,<br/>

&quot;I havn&#x27;t seen lilm all the afternoon. I<br/>
sent him out to play, and ho hasn&#x27;t been<br/>
In tho hotiso since,&quot; I replied,<br/>
Frank dropped his shavings, and started<br/>
out in search of him, I waited and waited<br/>
and shivered wltn the cold, but no Frank<br/>
came. I sat in the stiff-hacked chair and<br/>
closed my eyc. Tim Iat tiling I remem­<br/>
bered was a violent nod, which nearly dis­<br/>
ioc.ited my neck.<br/>
&quot;Hattlol&quot; I awoko with a l.ut. Frank<br/>
was shaking inc.<br/>
&quot;You&#x27;ll take your death-cold j yon have<br/>

&quot;Where was Ted? Did you lind him in<br/>

&quot;No,&quot; laughed Frank, &quot;but Just about<br/>
as bad; tho )oor fellow was in tho coal<br/>
cellar, asleep llko his mother.&quot;<br/>
I rubbed my eyes and looked at tho<br/>
child. Ho was covered with coal dust from<br/>
bis head to his feet, and was as black as a<br/>
negro. Frank prepared Biipper, whllo I<br/>
washed Ted&#x27;s faeo and hands.<br/>
&quot;How can you finish your cleaning with­<br/>

wcro so crisp and brlttlo that they broke<br/>
Into bits If you so much as looked at them,<br/>
nnd tho toast was burnt, and tho coffee not<br/>

hungry, It all tosted pretty good. After<br/>
wo liad cleared tho table, and piled the<br/>

did not awaken until a lato hour lu tho<br/>

wont to his office, and I to my cleaning.<br/>
Frank had tho carpets shaken, and the par­<br/>
lor floor being dry, I soon had It all tacked<br/>
down ; then moved tho chairs In and be­<br/>
gan to dust tho mantel ornaments; but oh,<br/>

and shivered it Into a thousand fragments,<br/>
A very bad beglnnlngof thoday, I thought,<br/>

was doing. What a sight met my eyes I<br/>
Ted was arrayed In my violet silk, pinned<br/>
up in front, and trailing far behind on the<br/>
floor) my whlto laeo shawl around his<br/>
shoulders, and my best bonnet on his head.<br/>
I stood transfixed for a moment, while<br/>
Ted went prancing round and round In tho<br/>
dust and dirt of tho attic, then I started af­<br/>
ter him. Of coursoho ran, ncreanilng and<br/>
laughing. &quot;Take carol&quot; I cried, hut too<br/>
lato; he fell from tho top to the bottom of<br/>
tho stairs.<br/>
Hip, rip, went my violet silk; bump,<br/>
bump, went Ted. I flow down stairs after<br/>
him with my heart In my month, and<br/>
picked up u little Insensible heap of laee,<br/>
ribbons, silk and dirt, That full saved<br/>
Ted from a good whipping. I carried him<br/>
down stairs, and sprinkled him with<br/>
water, camphor, cau-de-eologue, until ho<br/>
opened his eyes then I examined my ru­<br/>
ined clolhos. My dress va a mass of<br/>
<br/>
grease, cobwebs, and dust) tho front width<br/>
was wretchedly lorn with tho pins; mr<br/>
shawl and bonnet wero crushed and torn,<br/>
I put them all away, with a sigh of regret,<br/>
and turned my attention once more to tho<br/>
perpetrator of tho terrible deed, Justthen<br/>
some ono knocked on tho back door. On<br/>
opening It, I found a stout Herman girl on<br/>
tho step. Sho talked so broken that I could<br/>
scarcely understand her, but managed to<br/>
cotnprehond enough to know that Frank<br/>
had engaged hor for me. I set her to work<br/>
Immediately to clean tho china closet, and<br/>
returned to my wounded Tod, Suddenly<br/>
I heard a crash in tho dining room. &quot;Heav­<br/>
ens I&quot; 1 exclaimed, &quot;what can havo hap­<br/>
ponod now?&quot; and rushing out I found tho<br/>
frightoned girl clasping and unclasping<br/>
her hands In a heart-rending manner. No<br/>
wonder. Sho had upset tho table on which<br/>
all myshlnlng glass and china was placed.<br/>
Everything was literally smashed to piec­<br/>
es. My beautiful celery glasses t My gob.<br/>
lets, and tea-set! My fruit-stands I Was<br/>
there over such a poor, afflicted mortal as<br/>
I? Words fall mo to oxpress my feelings<br/>
at that moment. I sat down perfectly.<br/>
siiinueii to witness mo narrowing sight of<br/>
all my superb dishes swept away.<br/>
There camo another knock at tho door.<br/>
Tills tlmo mi Irish girl miulo her appear­<br/>
ance. I wondered If Frank Intended to<br/>
send a regiment to destroy my liouso.<br/>
Howover, I took hor In, and tho llrst thing<br/>
I tohl her to do was to answer tho door­<br/>
bell, which had rung twice. I jieeped<br/>
through the door, which wan partly open,<br/>
and saw two ladles, but could not distin<br/>
<br/>
guish who they worn.<br/>
&#x27; &quot;Mum, thcro Is two wlmmcn as wants<br/>
tusooyoz,&quot; said Ann, giving tho door n<br/>
violent push against my head.<br/>
&quot;Oo tqll them to oxeuso mo,&quot; I said t<br/>
and being cry dizzy from tho blow, I fail­<br/>
ed to uotlco that Ann, In hor stupidity,<br/>
had left tho sitting-room door wldo opeiv<br/>
anil ns tho ladios came out of tho parlor,<br/>
<br/>
thoy saw mo plainly,<br/>
.&quot;O mortification I&quot; I was all rB<br/>
dirt, but had becomo somQWhat reconciled<br/>
to my misfortunes by this tlmo.<br/>
When Frank camo up to supper, tho<br/>
hall was very dark), Ann was putting<br/>
down tho door mat. Frank had forgotten<br/>
all about tho now servant, and In tho dark­<br/>
ness mistook tha horrid Irish girl for mo,<br/>
and kissed her. Ann screamed and ran,<br/>
and fell over a chair. Frank tore rouml<br/>
and swore j said ho would rather bo In<br/>
bedlam than w here a woman was cleaning<br/>
houso ) wondered why I could not havo.tho<br/>
hall lighted. To alt this I mado no reply,<br/>
but smiled grimly. Being overwhelmed<br/>
with my griefs, I did not caro If Frank<br/>
l:lyel every scrvant-glrl In tha United<br/>
rittiv..<br/>
Tha next morning the airman girl loft.<br/>
Probably sho was fearful sho would en­<br/>
counter my frowns again. Ann remained<br/>
and wo proceeded to finish our havoc. Tho<br/>
day was gloriously begun by Ann, who<br/>
succeeded charmingly In breaking tho<br/>
globes of tho chandelier, and then upset­<br/>
ting the gold-Hsli. I was exasperated at<br/>
this. There lay my llsh on tho carpet, to<br/>
say nothing of tho water. I believe I<br/>
shook or slapped tho girl, I don&#x27;t remem­<br/>
ber which. Ann was so astonished at see­<br/>
ing mo fly Into such a passion, that sho<br/>
backed up against tho window, and thrust<br/>
her clumsy foot through my lace curlaln.<br/>
This was tho grand finale. I burst Into<br/>
tears, and so did Ann. Ted, hearing the<br/>
tobs, camo running In, and not knowing<br/>
what to mako of it, joined in and swelled<br/>
tho chorus. Amidst one of our longest<br/>
and loudest walls, tho street door sudden­<br/>
ly flew opon, and In walked my Aunt<br/>
Thankful, with sovcral dozen carpet-bags<br/>
and bundles, prepared evidently, for a<br/>
long visit.<br/>
&quot;In tho namo of all that Is wonderful!&quot;<br/>
sho shrloked, letting all her traps &#x27;fall,<br/>
&quot;what has happened ? Is Frank dead, Ted<br/>
scalded, or tho wliolo houso on fire.&quot;<br/>
I made no reply, but sobbed mercilessly<br/>
on.<br/>
&quot;Ilaltie 1&quot; cried Aunt Thankful, iu an<br/>
awful oicc, &quot;answer mo immediately.<br/>
What Is tho matter?&quot;<br/>
&quot;My laco curtain,&quot; 1 gurgled out.<br/>
Aunt Thankful put on her spoctacles, sat<br/>
down on tho floor, and examined It, &quot;Silly<br/>
pus,&quot; sho mumbled, &quot;I can darn that In<br/>
ten minutes.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes with blno stocking yarn,&quot; I said,<br/>
and began to laugh sarcastically, and then<br/>
I l.iuglied, nnd laughed. Ann laughed,<br/>
and Ted laughed. I&#x27;oor Aunt Thankful<br/>
stared at us in horror, and said :<br/>
&quot;flood heavens I they aro all stark mad )<br/>
and Jumping up oir the floor, sho seized<br/>
my arm and dragged mo Into tho bed­<br/>
room, and put mo to bed, then went out<br/>
and locked tho door, und loft mo alone. I<br/>
went to sloop. When I awoko Aunt<br/>
rViaikful was1 sitting by my bd sowing.<br/>
&quot;Aunt Thankful,&quot; I said, &quot;whon did<br/>
you conio?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yesterday morning,&quot; sho replied.<br/>
&quot;What tlmo Is it now?&quot; I Inquired.<br/>
&quot;Three o&#x27;clock,&quot; answered Aunt Thank­<br/>
ful.&quot;I have slept several hours, then,&quot; I<br/>
said. &quot;Was I asleep when you camo?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I should rather think not ; when I camo<br/>
yon were crazy, and I put you to lied.<br/>
You slept nil tho rest of tho day and night<br/>
until this blessed minute, and If you had<br/>
not been put to bed you would have bcon<br/>
In the Insane asylum now.&quot;<br/>
I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful glared<br/>
at mo and said :<br/>
&quot;If you laugh any more, I will put you<br/>
In the cellar, and feed you on bread and<br/>
water for a weok.&quot;<br/>
This not lielng a pleasant prospect, I sub­<br/>
sided.i&quot;You aro a precious woman to clean<br/>
house,&quot; continued she. &quot;I should have<br/>
thought a child would know better than to<br/>
commence to clean right in tho mlddlo of<br/>
tho house. You should commence In tho<br/>
attlo and go down. Don&#x27;t you know that<br/>
after you get through with tho down-stairs<br/>
tho dirt from tho attic will make It dirtier<br/>
than over?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I nover thought of that,&quot; I answered,<br/>
meekly.<br/>
&quot;And then begin when Its cold enough<br/>
to freeze I It&#x27;s a wonder you didn&#x27;t havo<br/>
the lung fqveror something worse,&quot; went<br/>
on Aunt Thankful.<br/>
&quot;I must get up and clean the attic,&quot; D<br/>
said.<br/>
&quot;No, you wont,&quot; said Aunt Thankful,<br/>
&quot;forlcloancd It myself.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, thero aro the rest of the carpets to<br/>
put down.&quot;<br/>
&quot;They&#x27;re all down.&quot;<br/>
&quot;And tho pictures.&quot;<br/>
&quot;All hung.&quot;<br/>
I gave a great sigh of relief. What<br/>
would I liavo dono If It had not been for<br/>
Aunt Thankful I Sho hail accomplished In<br/>
on? day what It would havo taken mo a<br/>
wcok to perform ; but then, I never bob a­<br/>
round like Aunt Thankful ; for she seems<br/>
to bo mado of wire. I havo learned slneo<br/>
then to tako Aunt Thankful&#x27;s advice, nev­<br/>
er to commence cleaning until tho weather<br/>
is warm, ami never to commence ut the<br/>
urongend of tho house.<br/>
Hut It was such a mortification to think<br/>
that my new plan was a total failure.<br/>

1 HOUSE CLEANING.<br/>
Every year I endeavor to make some improvement<br/>
in my method of house-cleaning.<br/>
This spring I made up my mind to adhere no<br/>
longer to the poky old plan of grandmother?<br/>
which was to begin at the attic, and wind up<br/>
in the cellar?but determined to strike out in<br/>
another direction : and so, while the subject<br/>
was rife in my mind, I set about executing my<br/>
new projects at once, although it was but the<br/>
first of April, and the weather quite chilly and<br/>
raw. In the first place, I had every stove<br/>
1. moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the<br/>
pictures taken from the walls, the curtaius<br/>
taken down, everything piled out on the buck<br/>
<br/>
if; porch, and the earjtetless halls tilled to overflowing<br/>
with chairs, statues, leather dusters,<br/>
[N vases, hair muttrasses, parian brackets, and<br/>
jjf pillows ; and while everything was in the wildji<br/>
est confusion, Frank cauie iu with distended<br/>
&#x27;p eyes.<br/>
(- &quot;What on earth is all this, IJattie ?&quot; he<br/>
|i exclaimed.<br/>
k&#x27; &quot;Why, Frank,&quot; I replied, pausing 111 uiy<br/>
If: efforts to reach a stray cobweb, &quot;we have<br/>
p commenced cleaning house,&quot; and 1 lowered iny<br/>
S; broom, and looked straight iu his face to see if<br/>
i, he fully realized the importance of these<br/>
i? words; but to my chagrin, he looked utterly<br/>
V indifferent, aud brushing off some stray cob<br/>
fei webs which bad floated down from the ceiling<br/>
If1 on to his coat sleeve, asked impatiently, &quot; Isn&#x27;t<br/>
K dinner ready ?&quot; &quot; Dinner !&quot;&#x27; I cried , &quot; I had<br/>
I*&#x27; no idea it was so late. I haven&#x27;t even comf&#x27;<br/>
menced dinner yet.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Pretty state of affairs,&quot; grumbled Frank,<br/>
ft *&#x27; I brought Edward Graham home with me.&quot;<br/>
&quot; Where is he?&quot; I asked faintly.<br/>
R &quot;In the parlur,&quot; replied Frank, crustily.<br/>
In * The floor is bare ; there isn&#x27;t a chair or any<br/>
I thing else for the man to sit on. 1 expect I&#x27;ll<br/>
1^ find him seated on the piano. But come,<br/>
ji Hattie,&quot; he added, &#x27;* what are you going to<br/>
i give us to eat ?&quot;<br/>
|ij &quot;O, Frank,&quot; 1 .aid, coaxingly, thinking of<br/>
&gt;1] my rough hair and the grease spots on my<br/>
W dress, &quot;can&#x27;t you get your dinner down town<br/>
|f| to day ?&quot;<br/>
Hi Frank looked cross, and said he supposed he<br/>
H could, and weHt dow n to the parlor. 1 leaned<br/>
R over the banister, and when Frank opened the<br/>
B| door, caught a glimpse of Ed. roaming around<br/>
R the desolate room, shivering, with his hands in<br/>
R) his pockets. 1 watched them go through the<br/>
iff ball, and heard Frank making some hateful<br/>
? remarks about women and house-cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
I He slammed the door violently, and 1 serenely<br/>
resumed roy sweeping, not in &quot;the least disturbed<br/>
by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed annoyance and<br/>
&quot;provoking manner. Frank was always a little<br/>
unreasonable; and he was always bringing<br/>
somebody home to dinner when I least expected<br/>
it.<br/>
Just then little Ted came toddling in,and wanted<br/>
to help. As I was about to make a change<br/>
of base, 1 took him with me down to the parlor,<br/>
gave hi:n a rag and a basin of water, and<br/>
told him he might clean the tloor. He sat<br/>
down in one corner of the room, and with a<br/>
face of most unearthly solemnity, at once<br/>
commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Nor ah was<br/>
upstairs, washing windows in the front chamber.<br/>
Suddenly there came a.loud crash, followed<br/>
by a terrible yell; it sounded as if the<br/>
whole house was tumbling down.<br/>
&quot;Heavens!&quot; 1 exclaimed, &quot;what can have<br/>
happened?&quot; I mounted the stairs, two steps at<br/>
a time, and there beheld Xorah lying full<br/>
length on the door, amidst the debris of a<br/>
broken step-ladder, pieces of glass, and soapsuds.<br/>
&quot;What is the matter ?&quot; I cried to the groauin*Pri­<br/>
% , ,<br/>
&quot;Shure, mum, 1 fell from the ladder agin the<br/>
windy, au1 cut meself most awful,&quot; moaned<br/>
Xorah.<br/>
I helped the heavy girl to arise, bound up her<br/>
lacerated arm, left her to pick up the fragments<br/>
of glass and wood, and returned to the parlor,<br/>
there to find Ted scouring the piano legs with<br/>
the scrubbing brush. 1 quickly relieved him<br/>
from all further labor, bundled him up, aud<br/>
aeut him out in the yard to play.<br/>
&quot;Faith, mum,&quot; said Xorah, standing in the<br/>
door, &quot;1 feel so faint, au&#x27; if 1 don&#x27;t be takin&#x27;<br/>
aomethiu&#x27;strong 1 can&#x27;t work no more to day.&#x27;*<br/>
&quot;Then make yourself some tea,&#x27;&#x27; i replied.<br/>
But Xorah disdainfully said :<br/>
&quot;I never could stouiacb tay ; the very smiil<br/>
of it makes roe sick.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, then take some brandy,&quot; I replied<br/>
Now I ought to have known better than to<br/>
allow Xorah to help herself to the brandy, but<br/>
being in such a hurry to timsh the parlor, 1<br/>
could not couveuieutly stop.<br/>
When I had occasion to go through the hall<br/>
again, I paused aud listened ; 1 could hear<br/>
nothing oi Xorah moving about, so ouce more<br/>
<br/>
II mounted the stairs. There, in the middle ot<br/>
the room, she sat iu a rocking chair, a bucket<br/>
of water sood before her, while she swayed<br/>
lazily back and forth with the mop in her hand,<br/>
which left a long trail of dirty water behind it.<br/>
&#x27;Norah,&quot; 1 cried, &quot;didn&#x27;t i tell you to uiop<br/>
tlua Uoor&#x27;/&quot;<br/>
&quot;Faith, mum, an l&#x27;in doiu&#x27; it a? last as 1<br/>
can,&#x27; ahe replied.<br/>
&quot;How can you uiop sifting Joan ?&quot; 1 asked, &lt;<br/>
indignantly.<br/>
&quot;Get right out of that chair,&quot; 1 said.<br/>
Norah slowly arose and staggered against<br/>
the wall.<br/>
Hie, mum, hie, yez see I se awake.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#x27;re drank, you had better say,&quot; 1 re plied.<br/>
&quot;Lfruuk, d&#x27;ye call it!&quot; exclaimed Norah, an- 1<br/>
grily, trying to look diguitied ; &quot;drunk, after<br/>
takin&#x27; one tay spoonful of brandy iu a quart of<br/>
water!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Leave the room and go to bed,&quot; 1 said iu- j<br/>
dignautly ; &quot;to morrow 1 shall dismiss you.&quot;<br/>
After much arguing, Norah finally decided<br/>
to retire, and 1 was left sole monarch of all the !<br/>
dirt and disorder.<br/>
I surveyed the room for awhile in despair,<br/>
but the work had to be done, and 1 seized the<br/>
uiop and scon finished. When 1 was about to<br/>
deeoeud the stairs, all tired and dirty, 1 heard<br/>
Frank calling.<br/>
&quot;Hattie! Hattie! where iu the world are<br/>
yoo?&quot;<br/>
f &quot;?ere,&quot; I replied.<br/>
Frank came up the &lt;incar|a*ted stairs, aud<br/>
tumbled over the mop.<br/>
&quot;Confound it!&quot; he cried, &quot;why is this house<br/>
as dark as Egypt? Well,&quot; be went on, &quot;are<br/>
we to go to bed rapperles* as well as dinner<br/>
iaeef<br/>
&quot;There is do fire made,&#x27;* I said. &quot;Norah h<br/>
drunk, and I am cired to death ; and?and?&quot; .<br/>
here I burst into tears, and sat duwu ou the<br/>
wet floor.<br/>
&quot; Why, Hattie ! Hattie ! what arc you cry-1<br/>
<br/>
ing about? I&#x27;ll make the fire; never mind!<br/>
about the sapper ; had a capital dioner down<br/>
town ; come down stairs out of this damp<br/>
room.&quot;<br/>
And Frank, who always got good and sorry<br/>
the moment after he was cross, helped me off<br/>
the floor, and down stairs into the kitchen.<br/>
* Now don&#x27;t cry any more,&quot; he said, wiping<br/>
my tear-bedewed cheek with his handkerchief,<br/>
&quot;sit down, and I&#x27;ll have a tire in two<br/>
minutes.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where&#x27;s Ted?&quot; he inquired, pausing for<br/>
<br/>
breath between the vigorous puffs at the tire.<br/>
&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen hiui all the afternoon. I<br/>
sent him out to play and he hasn&#x27;t been in the<br/>
house since,&quot; I replied.<br/>
Frank dropped the shavings and started out<br/>
in search of hi in.<br/>
1 waited arid waited, and shivered with the<br/>
cold, but no Frunk came. I sat in the stiff<br/>
backed chair arid closed my eyes. The last<br/>
I thing I remembered was a violent nod which<br/>
nearly dislocated my neck.<br/>
&quot; Hattie!&quot;<br/>
1 awoke with a start. Frank was shaking<br/>
me.<br/>
&quot; You will take your death of cold ; you have<br/>
been fast asleep.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where was Ted ? Did you find him in the<br/>
cistern?&quot; 1 asked, dreamily.<br/>
&quot;No,&quot; laughed Frank, &quot; but just about as<br/>
bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar,<br/>
asleep like his mother.&quot;<br/>
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child;<br/>
he was covered with coal dust from his head to<br/>
his feet, and as black as any negro. Frank<br/>
prepared supper while I washed Ted&#x27;s face aud<br/>
hands. .<br/>
&quot; llow can you finish your cleaning without<br/>
Norah?&quot; he inquired.<br/>
&quot; I am sure I don&#x27;t see how 1 can,&quot; I replied,<br/>
as the mountains of work arose in my troubled<br/>
tnind. &quot;Norah must be sent away in the<br/>
morning.&quot;<br/>
We all ate heartily of our BUpper, notwithstanding<br/>
the eggs were fried until they were so<br/>
Crist) aud brittle that they broke into bits if you<br/>
so much as looked at them, and the toast was<br/>
burnt, and the coffee not half boiled ; still, as I<br/>
was so hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After<br/>
<br/>
we bad cleaned away the table and piled the<br/>
dishes away to be washed in the morning, we<br/>
retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken<br/>
until a late hour in the morning.<br/>
Norah was dismissed. Frank went to his<br/>
office and 1 to tny cleaning. Frank had the<br/>
carpet shaken, and the parlor floor being dry,<br/>
I soon had it all tacked down ; then moved the<br/>
chairs ili, and began to dust the mantel ornaments,<br/>
but, O horror ! I let fall one of my<br/>
loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand<br/>
fragments. A very bad beginniug of the day,<br/>
I thought, sorrowfully picking up the pieces.<br/>
44 Mamma,&quot; cried a shrill voice, &quot; I&#x27;s all<br/>
jess up.&quot;<br/>
44 W here are you, Ted I called.<br/>
44 Here,&quot; cried Ted.<br/>
44 And where is 4here;&#x27; you&#x27;re in some mischief,<br/>
I&#x27;ll be bound.&quot;<br/>
1 heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, and a great<br/>
scrambling up the attic stairs.<br/>
After 1 had throwu the shattered pieces ol<br/>
my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what ht<br/>
was doing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted<br/>
was arrayed iu my violet silk, pinned up it<br/>
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my<br/>
white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my<br/>
best bonnet on his head.<br/>
I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted<br/>
went prancing round und round iu the dust and<br/>
dirt of the attic ; then 1 started after him. Ol<br/>
course be ran, screaming and laughing. 4,Tak&lt;<br/>
care,&quot; I cried, but too late ; be fell from th&lt;<br/>
top to the bottom of the stairs.<br/>
Kip, rip, weut my violet silk ; bump, bump<br/>
went Ted. I flew down after him with my hear<br/>
in my mouth, and picked up a little iusensibh<br/>
heap of lace, ribbous, silk and dirt. That fal<br/>
saved Ted from a good whipping. I carriet<br/>
him down stairs, and sprinkled him profusely<br/>
With uut^r natnnhnr itmi onn Jo onliwrni&#x27; nnti<br/>
<br/>
be opened his eyes ; then 1 examined my ruinec<br/>
clothes. My dress was a mass of grease, cob<br/>
webs and dust , the front width was wretchedly<br/>
torn with the puis; my shawl and bonnet was<br/>
crushed and torn. 1 put them all away with ?<br/>
sigh of regret, and turned my attention once<br/>
more to the perpetrator of this terrible deed<br/>
Just then some one knocked at the back door<br/>
On opening it 1 found a stout German girl on<br/>
the step who talked so broken that I coulc<br/>
scarcely understand her, but managed to com<br/>
prehend enough to know that Frank hud en<br/>
gaged her for me. 1 set her to work iinmedi<br/>
ately to clean the china closet, and returned tc<br/>
uiy wounded Ted. Suddenly 1 heard a terrible<br/>
crash in the dining-room. &quot;Ileavensl&quot; I ex<br/>
claimed ; &quot;what can have happoued now ?&quot; and<br/>
rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping<br/>
and unclasping her hands in a heartrending<br/>
mariner. No wonder. She had upset the table<br/>
on which all my shining glass and chiuu wan<br/>
placed. Everything was literally smashed to<br/>
fiieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My gobets,<br/>
and tea-set! My fruit stands ! Was there<br/>
ever such a poor afflicted mortal as 1 &#x27;i Wordu<br/>
failed me to express my feelings at that momeut.<br/>
1 sat down perfectly stunned, to witnese<br/>
the harrowiug sight of all uiy superb dishes<br/>
swept away.<br/>
There came another knock at the door. This<br/>
time an Irish girl made her appearance. I<br/>
i wondered if Frank intended to send a regiment<br/>
! to destroy my house. However, J took her in,<br/>
<br/>
and the nrst thing 1 told her to do was to answer<br/>
the door bell wliich bad rung twice. I<br/>
peeped through the door, which was partly<br/>
open, and saw two ladies, but could uot distinguish<br/>
who tbey were.<br/>
44 Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to<br/>
see yez,&quot; said Anu, giving the door u violent<br/>
push against my head.<br/>
4*Go tell them to excuse me,&quot; I said ; and<br/>
beiDg very dizzy from the blow, I failed to<br/>
notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the<br/>
sitting-rooiu door wide open, aud as the ladies<br/>
came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.<br/>
41 O mortification !&quot; I was all rags and dirt,<br/>
but had become somewhat reconciled to any<br/>
misfortunes by this time.<br/>
When Frank came up to supper, the hall<br/>
was very dark ; Ann was putting down the door<br/>
mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant,<br/>
and in the darkness mistook the horid Irish<br/>
girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed<br/>
and rau, and fell over a chair; Frank tore<br/>
j round and swore : and said he would rather<br/>
I be in Bedlam than where a woman was cleaning<br/>
house ; wondered why I couldn&#x27;t have the hall<br/>
lighted. To all this I made no reply, but<br/>
smiled grimly. Being so overwhelmed with<br/>
; my own griefs, 1 did not care if Frank kissed<br/>
! every servant girl in the United States.<br/>
The next morning the German girl left.<br/>
Probably she was fearful she should encounter<br/>
my frown again. Ann remained, and we proceeded<br/>
to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously<br/>
begun by Ann, who succeeded charui:<br/>
iogly iu breaking the glultes of the chandelier,<br/>
and upsetting my gold fish on the carpet, to<br/>
say nothing of the water. 1 believe 1 shook or<br/>
slapped the girl, 1 don&#x27;t remember which.<br/>
Ann who art uKturiislieil wt n^?ini/ lite He into<br/>
<br/>
sucb a passion that she hacked up against the<br/>
window and thrust her clumsy foot through<br/>
&#x27; my lace curtain. This was the grand finale.<br/>
1 hurst into tears and so did Ann. Ted, hearing<br/>
the sobs, came running in, and not knowing<br/>
what to make of it, joined in the chorus.<br/>
Aiuidst one of our longest and loudest wails,<br/>
the street door suddenly flew open, and in<br/>
walked tuy Aunt Thankful, with several dozen<br/>
carpet hags and bundles, prepared evidently<br/>
for a long visit.<br/>
iu the name of all that&#x27;s wonderful!&quot; she<br/>
shrieked, letting all her traps fall. &quot; What<br/>
has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded,<br/>
or the house on fire?&quot;<br/>
1 made no reply, hut sobbed heedlessly ou.<br/>
&quot;ilattie!&quot; cried Aunt Thankful, in an awtul<br/>
voice. &quot; Answer me immediately. What is<br/>
the matter ?&quot;<br/>
&quot; My lace curtain,&quot; I gurgled out.<br/>
Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat<br/>
down on the iiuor and examined it. &quot; Silly<br/>
puss,&quot; she mumbled- &quot; I can darn that iu ten<br/>
minutes.&#x27;&#x27;<br/>
&quot; Yes, with blue stocking yarn,&quot; I said, and<br/>
began to laugh sarcastically, and tbeu 1 laughed<br/>
aud laughed. Ann laughed, and Ted laughed.<br/>
Poor Aunt Thankful stared at us iu horror, and<br/>
a**ist<br/>
<br/>
Miood Heavens! they are all stark mad;&quot;<br/>
and jumped up off the floor ; ahe seized uiy ariu<br/>
aud dragged me into the bed room, and put me<br/>
to bed, then went out aud locked the door,<br/>
and left me alone, i went to sleep. When I<br/>
awoke Auut Thankful was fitting by the bed<br/>
dewing.<br/>
Aunt Thankful,&quot; 1 said, &quot;when did you<br/>
come ?&quot;<br/>
&#x27;Yesterday morning,&quot; she replied.<br/>
44 What time is it now ?&quot; 1 inquired.<br/>
&quot;Three o&#x27;clock,&quot; answered Auut Thankful.<br/>
* 1 have slept several hours, then,&quot; 1 said.<br/>
Was 1 asleep when you came?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I should rather think not; when I came<br/>
you were crazy, and I put you to bed. \rou (<br/>
<br/>
THE 3STE<br/>

bleosed minute, and if you hadn&#x27;t been put to<br/>
bed you would hare bean put in the insane asylam,<br/>

I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful stared at<br/>
me and said :<br/>
&quot;If you laugh any more 1 will put you in<br/>
the cellar, and feed you on bread and water for j<br/>
a week.&quot;<br/>
This not being a pleasant prospect, I subsided.<br/>

<br/>
Every yearlI endeavor to make some im-<br/>
<br/>
rovement in my method of house-cleaning.<br/>
This spring I made up my mind to adhere no<br/>
longer to the poky old plan of grandmother—<br/>
which was to begin at the attic, and wind up<br/>
in the cellar—but determined to strike out in<br/>
snother direction; and so, while the subject<br/>
was rife in my mind, I set about executing my<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
new projects at once, although it was but the | j<br/>
<br/>
first of April, and the weather quite chilly and<br/>
raw. In the first place, I had every stove<br/>
moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the<br/>
pictures taken from the walls, the curtains<br/>
taken down, everything piled out on the buck<br/>
pore and the carpetiess halls filled to over-<br/>
<br/>
owing with chairs, statues, feather dusters,<br/>
vases, hair mattrasses, parian brackets, and<br/>
pillows ; and while everything was in the wild-<br/>
est confusion, Frank came in with ‘distended<br/>
<br/>
8.<br/>
<br/>
“‘What on earth is all this, Hattie?’ he<br/>
exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
**Why, Frark,” I replied, pausing in my<br/>
efforts to reach a stray cobweb, “we have<br/>
commenced cleaning house,” and I lowered my<br/>
broom, and looked straight in his face to see if<br/>
he fully realized the importance of these<br/>
words ; but to my chagrin, he looked atterly<br/>
indifferent, and brashing off some stray cob-<br/>
webs which had floated down from the ceiling<br/>
on to his coat sleeve, asked impatiently, “ Isn’t<br/>
dinner ready ”’ “ Dinner!&quot; I cried; “I had<br/>
no idea it was so late. I haven&#x27;t even com-<br/>
menced dinner yet.’’ -<br/>
<br/>
‘Pretty state of affairs,” grumbled Frank.<br/>
“TI brought Edward Graham home with me.”<br/>
<br/>
“‘ Where is he?’’ I asked faintly.<br/>
<br/>
“‘In the parlor,” replied Frank, crustily.<br/>
“ The floor is bare ; there isn’t a chair or any-<br/>
thing else for the man to sit on. I expect I&#x27;ll<br/>
find him seated on the piano. But come,<br/>
Hattie,” he added, “what are you going to<br/>
give us to eat?’<br/>
<br/>
“O, Frank,’’ I said, coaxingly, thinking of<br/>
my rough hair and the grease spots on my<br/>
dress, ‘‘ can’t you get your dinner down town<br/>
to-day ?”’<br/>
<br/>
Frank looked cross, and said he supposed he<br/>
could, and went down to the parlor. 1 leaned<br/>
over the banister, and when Frank opened the<br/>
door, caught a glimpse of Ed. roaming around<br/>
the desolate room, shivering, with his hands in<br/>
his pockets. I watched them go through the<br/>
hall, and heard Frank making some hateful<br/>
remarks about women and pe fp<br/>
He slammed the door violently, and J serenely<br/>
resumed my sweeping, not in the least dis-<br/>
turbed by Frank&#x27;s unconcealed annoyance and<br/>
provoking manner. Frank was always a little<br/>
unreasonable ; and he was always bringing<br/>
somebody home to dinner when I least ex-<br/>
pected it. orb<br/>
<br/>
Just then little Ted came toddling in,and want-<br/>
ed tohelp. As I wae about to make achange<br/>
of base, r took him with me down to the par-<br/>
lor, gave him @ rag and a basin of water, and<br/>
teld him he might clean the floor. He sat<br/>
down in one corner of the room, and with a<br/>
face of most unearthly solemnity, at once<br/>
commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Norah was<br/>
upstairs, washing windows in the front cham-<br/>
ber. Suddenly there came a loud crash, fol-<br/>
lowed by a terrible yell; it sounded as if the<br/>
whole house was tumbling down.<br/>
<br/>
“Heavens!” I exclaimed, ‘‘what can have<br/>
happened ?” I mounted the stairs, two steps at<br/>
@ time,and there beheld Norah lying fall<br/>
len on the floor, amidst the debris of a<br/>
broken step-ladder, pieces of glass, and soup-<br/>
suds.<br/>
<br/>
“What is the matter ?” I cried to the groan-<br/>
ing girl.<br/>
<br/>
“Shure, mum, I fell from the ladder agin the<br/>
windy, an’ cut meself most awful,’ moaned<br/>
Norah.<br/>
<br/>
I helped the heavy girl to arise, bound up her<br/>
lacerated arm, left her to pick up the fragments<br/>
of glass and wood, and returned to the parlor,<br/>
there to find Ted scouring thé piano legs with<br/>
the scrubbing brush. I quickly relieved him<br/>
from all farther labor, bundled bim up, and<br/>
sent him out in the yard to play.<br/>
<br/>
‘Faith, mum,” said Norab, standing in the<br/>
door, “I feel so faint, aun’ if I don’t be takin’<br/>
somethin’ stroog I can’t work no more to-day.”<br/>
<br/>
“Then make yourself some tea,” I replied.<br/>
<br/>
But Norah disdeinfully said :<br/>
<br/>
“JT never could stomach tay; the very sinill<br/>
of it makes me sick.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, then take some brandy,’’ I replied<br/>
<br/>
Now I ought to have known better than to<br/>
allow Norah to help herself to the braady, but<br/>
being in such a burry to finish the parlor, |<br/>
could not conveniently stop.<br/>
<br/>
When I had occasion to go through the hall<br/>
again, 1 paused and listened; 1 could hear<br/>
nothing of Norah moving about, so once more<br/>
I mounted the stairs. There, in the middle of<br/>
the room, she sat in a rocking chair, a bucket<br/>
of water sood before her, while she swayed<br/>
lazily back and forth with the mop in her hand, |<br/>
which left a long trail of =e § water behind it. |<br/>
<br/>
‘‘Norah,’’ I cried, “‘dida’t 1 tell you to mop<br/>
this floor?’’<br/>
<br/>
“Faith, mum, an’ I&#x27;m doin’ it as fast as I<br/>
can,” she replied.<br/>
<br/>
“How can you mop sifting down?” I asked,<br/>
indignantly. :<br/>
<br/>
“Get right out of that chair,’ I said.<br/>
<br/>
Norah slowly aruse and staggered against<br/>
the wall.<br/>
<br/>
**Hic, mum, bic, yez see I’se awake.”<br/>
<br/>
“You&#x27;re drunk, you bad better say,’ I re<br/>
<br/>
lied.<br/>
“Drank, d’ye call it!” exclaimed Norah, an-<br/>
grily, trying to look dignified ; “drunk, after<br/>
takin’ one tay-speonful of brandy in a quart of<br/>
water !’’<br/>
<br/>
“Leave the room and go to bed,’’ I said in-<br/>
dignantly ; “to-morrow I shall dismiss you.”<br/>
<br/>
After much argaing, Norah omen decided<br/>
to retire, and I wag left svle monarch of al! the<br/>
dirt and disorder. ‘a ‘<br/>
<br/>
I surveyed the room for awhile in despair,<br/>
but the work had to be done, and! seized the<br/>
mop and soon finished. When I was about to<br/>
descend the stairs, all tired and dirty, I beard<br/>
Frank calling.<br/>
<br/>
“Hattie! Hattie! where ia the world are<br/>
you?”<br/>
<br/>
vars I replied.<br/>
<br/>
rank came up the uncarpeted stairs, and<br/>
stumbled over the mop. eee<br/>

Uawoke with a start. Frank was shaking<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
“ You will take your death of cold ; you have<br/>
been fast asleep.”<br/>
‘“Where was Ted? Did you find him in the<br/>

until a late hour in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Norah was dismissed. Frank went to his<br/>
office and 1 to my cleaning. Frank hed the<br/>
carpet shaken, and the parer floor beis<br/>
I soon had it all tacked down ;<br/>
chairs if, and began to dust the mantel orna-<br/>
ments, but, O horror!<br/>
loveliest vases and shivered it into a tho<br/>
fragments. A very bad beginning of the day,<br/>
I thought, sorrowfully picking up the pieces.<br/>
<br/>
“Mamma,” cried a shrill voice, “I&#x27;s all<br/>
<br/>
jess ~<br/>
<br/>
‘‘Where are you, Ted ?” I called.<br/>
<br/>
‘* Here,” cried Ted.<br/>
<br/>
* And where is ‘here;’ you&#x27;re in some mis-<br/>
ebief, 1&#x27;ll be bound.”<br/>
<br/>
I heard Ted’s chuckling laugh, and 9 great<br/>
scrambling bh the attic stairs.<br/>
<br/>
After I had thrown the shattered pieces of<br/>
my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what he<br/>
was doing. What a sight met my eyes! Ted<br/>
was arrayed in my violét silk, pinned up in<br/>
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my<br/>
white lace shaw! around his shoulders, and my<br/>
best bonnet on his head.<br/>
<br/>
I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted<br/>
went prancing round and round in the dust and<br/>
<br/>
course he ran, screaming and laughing. “Take<br/>
care,” I cried, but too late; he felt from the<br/>
top to the bottom of the stuirs.<br/>
ip, rip, went my violet silk ; bump, bump,<br/>
went Ted. I flew down after him with my heart<br/>
in my mouth, and picked yp a little insensible<br/>
heap of lace, ribbons, silk and dirt. That fall<br/>
sated Ted from a good whipping. I carried<br/>
him down stairs, and sprinkled him profusely<br/>
with water, camphor, and eau-de-cologne, until<br/>
he opened his eyes ; then I examined my ruined<br/>
clothes. My dress was a mass of grease, cob-<br/>
webs and dust ; the front width was wretchedly<br/>
torn with the pins; my shawl and bonnet was<br/>
crushed and tora. I put them all away with a<br/>
sigh of regret, and turned my attention once<br/>
more to the perpetrator of this terrible deed.<br/>
Just then some one knocked at the back door.<br/>
On opening it 1 found a stout German girl on<br/>
the step who talked so broken that I could<br/>
searcely understand her, but managed to com-<br/>
prehend enough to know that Frank had en-<br/>
gaged her for me. 1 set her to work immedi-<br/>
ately to clean the china closet, and retarned to<br/>
my wounded Ted. Suddenly I heard a terrible<br/>
crash in the dining-room. ‘‘Heavens!” I ex-<br/>
claimed ; “what can have happened now ?’’ and<br/>
rushing out I found the frightened girl clasp-<br/>
ing and unclasping her hands ina heartrending<br/>
manner. No wonder. She had upset the table<br/>
en which all my shining glase and china was<br/>
placed. Everything was literally smashed to<br/>
jeces. My beautiful celery glasses! My A one<br/>
ets, and tea-set! My fruitatands! Was there<br/>
ever such @ poor afflicted mortal as 1? Words<br/>
failed me to express my feelings at that mo-<br/>
ment. I sat down perfectly stunned, to witness<br/>
the harrowing sight of all my superb dishes<br/>
swept away. r<br/>
<br/>
There came another knock at the door. This<br/>
time an Irish girl made her appearance. I<br/>
wondered if Frank intended to send a regiment<br/>
to destroy my house. However, ] took ber in,<br/>
and the first thing I told her to do was to an-<br/>
swer the door bell which had rung twice. I<br/>
peeped through the door, which was partly<br/>
open, and saw two ladies, but could not dis-<br/>
tinguish who they were.<br/>
<br/>
“Mam, there are two wimmen as wants to<br/>
see yez,” said re the door a violent<br/>
push against my head.<br/>
<br/>
“Go tell them to excuse me,’ I said; and<br/>
being very dizzy from the blow, I failed to<br/>
notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the<br/>
sitting-roora door wide open, and as the ladies<br/>
came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.<br/>
<br/>
“© mortification !” I was all rags and dirt,<br/>
but had become somewhat reconciled to any<br/>
misfortunes by this time.<br/>
<br/>
When Frank caiie up to supper, the hall<br/>
was very dark ; Ann was putting down the door<br/>
mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant,<br/>
and in the darkness mistook the horid Irish<br/>
girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed<br/>
and ran, and fell over a chair; Frank tore<br/>
round and swore: and seid he would rather<br/>
be in Bedlam than where a woman was on<br/>
house; wondered why I couldu&#x27;t have the hall<br/>
lighted. To all this I made no reply, but<br/>
smiled grimly. Being so overwhel: with<br/>
my own griefs, 1 did not care if Frank kissed<br/>
every servant girl in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning the German ‘girl left.<br/>
Probably she was fearful she should encounter<br/>
in. Aon remained, and we pro-<br/>
ceeded to finish our havoc. The day was glo-<br/>
riously begun by Aun, who succeeded charm-<br/>
ingly in breaking the ~ of rong om pe<br/>
and upsetting my gold fish on carpet, to<br/>
say ockine of the water. I believe I shook or<br/>
slapped the girl, I don’t remember which.<br/>
Ann was so astonished at seeing me fy into<br/>
such a passion that she backed up against the<br/>
window and thrust her clamsy foot th h<br/>
my lace curtain. This was the grand finale.<br/>
I burst into tears and so did Ann. Ted, hear-<br/>
ing the sobs, came running in, and not kuow-<br/>
ing what to make of it, joined in the chorus.<br/>
Amidst one of our longest and loudest wails,<br/>
the street door suddenly flew open, and in<br/>
walked my Aunt Thankful, with several dozen<br/>
carpet bags and bundles, prepared evidently<br/>
for a long visit.<br/>
=“ Io the name of all that&#x27;s wonderful !&#x27;’ she<br/>
shrieked, letting all her traps fall. “ What<br/>
has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded,<br/>
or the house on fire?”<br/>
<br/>
I made no reply, but sobbed heedlessly on.<br/>

ghed. Ann laughed, and Ted lnothed,<br/>

me up off the floor, and down stairs into the<br/>
kitchen.<br/>
&quot;Now, don&#x27;t cry any more,&quot; he said, wip­<br/>
ine my tear-bedewed cheeks with his hand­<br/>
kerchief; sit down, and I&#x27;ll have a fire in<br/>
two minutes.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where&#x27;s Ted P&quot; he inquired, pausing for<br/>
breath between the vigorous puffs at the<br/>
fire.<br/>
&quot;I&#x27; haven&#x27;t seen him all the afternoon. I<br/>
sent him out to play, and he hasn&#x27;t been in<br/>
the house since,&quot; I replied.<br/>
Frank dropped the shavings and started<br/>
out in search of him. I waited and waited,<br/>
and shivered with the cold, but no Frank<br/>
came.. I sat in the stiff-backed chair and<br/>
closed my eves. The last thing I remember<br/>
was a violent nod which nearly dislocated<br/>
my neck.<br/>
&quot;Hattie !&quot; I awoke with a start. Frank<br/>
was shaking me,<br/>
&quot;You will take your death cf cold; you<br/>
have been fast asleep.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where was Ted? did you findhim in the<br/>
cistern ?&quot; I asked, dreamily.<br/>
&quot;No,&quot; laughed Frank, &quot;but just about as<br/>
bad; the peor fellow was in the coal cellar<br/>
asleep, like his mother.&quot;<br/>
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child<br/>
he was covered with coal dust from his head<br/>
to his feet, and was as black as a negro.<br/>
Frank prepared supper while I washed Ted&#x27;s<br/>
face and hands.<br/>
&quot;How can you finish your cleaning with­<br/>
out Norah ?&quot; he inquired.<br/>
&quot;I am sure I don&#x27;t see how I can,&quot; I re<br/>
plied, as the mountain of work arose in my<br/>
troubled mind. &quot;Norah must be sent away<br/>
in the morning.&quot;<br/>
We all ate heartily of our supper, not­<br/>
withstanding the eggs were fried until they<br/>
were so crisp ani brittle that they broke in­<br/>
to bits if you so much as looked at them.<br/>
and the toast was burnt, and the coffee not<br/>
half boiled; still, as I was ravenously hun­<br/>
gry, it all tasted pretty good. After we had<br/>
cleared away the table, and piled the dishes<br/>
away to be washed in the morning, we re­<br/>
tired, and being so fatigued, I did not awak­<br/>
en until a late hour in the morning. Norah<br/>
was dismissed, Frank went to his office, and<br/>
I to my cleaning. Frank had the carpets<br/>
shaken, and the parlor floor being dry, I<br/>
soon had it all tacked down, and then moved<br/>
the chairs in,and began to dust the mantel<br/>
ornaments; but, Oh, horror! I let fall one<br/>
of my loveliest vases and shivered it into a<br/>
thousand fragments. A very bad beglnn&amp;ng<br/>
of the day, I thought, sorrowfully, picking<br/>
nu the pieces.<br/>
&quot;Mamma,&quot; cried a shrill voice, &quot;I is al<br/>
jessed up.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where are you, Teddy ?&quot; I called.<br/>
&quot;Here,&quot; cried Ted.<br/>
&quot;And where is &#x27;here?&#x27; You&#x27;re in some<br/>
mischief, I&#x27;ll be bound.&quot;<br/>
I heard Ted&#x27;s chuckling laugh, and a<br/>
great scrambling up the attic stairs. After I<br/>
had thrown the shattered pieces of my vase<br/>
away, I ran up stairs to see what he was do­<br/>
ing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted was<br/>
arrayed in my violet silk, pinned up in front<br/>
and trailing far behind en the floor, my<br/>
white shawl around his shoulders,and my<br/>
best bonnet on his head. I stood transfixed<br/>
for a moment, while Ted went prancing<br/>
round and round in the dust and dirt of the<br/>
attic; then I started after him. Of course<br/>
he ran, screaming and laughing. &quot;Take<br/>
care,&quot; I cried, but too late; he tell from the<br/>
top to&#x27; she bottom of the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
ip. rip, went my violet silk; bump,bump,<br/>
went Ted. I flew down alter him with my<br/>
heart in my month, and picked up a little in­<br/>
sensible heap of lace, ribbons, silk and dirt.<br/>
That fall saved Ted from a good whipping.<br/>
I carried him down stairs and sprinkled him<br/>
profusely with water, camphor and eau-de­<br/>
cologne, until he opened his eyes; then I ex­<br/>
amined my ruined clothes. My dress was a<br/>
mass of grease, cobwebs and dust ; the front<br/>
width was wretchedly torn with the pins;<br/>
myshawl and bonnet were erushed and torn.<br/>
I put them all away with a sigh of regret,<br/>
and turned my attentien once more to the<br/>
perpetrator of this terrible deed. Just then<br/>
same one knocked at the back door. On<br/>
opening it, I found a stout German girl on<br/>
the step; she talked so broken that I could<br/>
hardly understand her, but managed to<br/>
comprehend enough to know that Frank had<br/>
engaged her for me. I set aer to work im­<br/>
mediately to clean the china closet, lhd re­<br/>
turned to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I<br/>
heard a terrible crash in the dining-room.<br/>
&quot;Heavens!&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;what can have<br/>
happened now &quot; and rushtng out I found<br/>
the frightened girl elasping and unclasping<br/>
her bands in a heartrendnlg manner. No<br/>
wonder. She had upset the table on which<br/>
allmy shiinng glass and chinawas placed.<br/>
Everything was literally smashed to pieces.<br/>
My beautiful celeryglasses! My goblesand<br/>
tea-set! My fruit stands! Was there ever<br/>
sunch a poor affleted mortal as I? Words fail<br/>
me to express my feelings at that moment,<br/>
Isatdown per_ t stunned, towitness the<br/>
harrowg sight of all my superb dishes<br/>
swept away.<br/>
There came another knock at the door.<br/>
This time an Irish girl made her appear­<br/>
anep. I wonder if Frank intended to send a<br/>
regiment to destroy my house. However, I<br/>
took herin, and the irst thing I told her to<br/>
do was to answer the door , which rung<br/>
twie.I peeped through the door,<br/>
which was partly open, and saw twoladies,<br/>
but could not distinguish who they were.<br/>
&quot;Mum, they are two wiomen as wants to<br/>
see yes,&quot; said Ann, giving the door a vio­<br/>

&quot;Go tell them to excuse me,&quot; I raid, and<br/>
biteg ery dizzy from the blow, I failed to<br/>

the sitag-room door wide open, and as the<br/>
ladies came out of the parlor, they saw me<br/>

at me and said :<br/>
&quot;If you laugh any more I will put you in<br/>
