Reviews of the Work  
  
“Manhood, by J.L. Curtis. —“We agree with the Author that, so far from works of this class being objectionable in the hands of youth, or difficulties being opposed every facility should be given to their circulation; and, to strengthen our opinion, we need but refer to the recent distressing events at our Military and Scholastic Academies at Carshalton and Woolrich.” —Naval and Military Gazette. —1st Feb., 1851.  
  
“We feel no hesitation in saying, that there is no member of society by whim the book will not be found useful, whether such person hold the relation of a Parent, Preceptor, or Clergyman.” —Sun Evening Paper
