Du Guerchy the French Ambassador is gone home, and Monsieur Durand is left Minister Plenipotentiary. He is extremely curious to inform himself in the affairs of America; pretends to have a great esteem for me, on account of the abilities shown in my examination; has desired to have all my political writings, invited me to dine with him, was very inquisitive, treated me with great civility, makes me visits, &amp;c. I fancy that intriguing nation would like very well to meddle on occasion, and blow up the coals between Britain and her colonies; but I hope we shall give them no opportunity.  
I write this in a great hurry, being setting out in an hour on another journey with my steady good friend Sir John Pringle. We propose to visit Paris. Durand has given me letters of recommendation to the Lord knows who. I am told I shall meet with great respect there; but winds change and perhaps it will be full as well if I do not. We shall be gone about six weeks. I have a little private commission to transact of which more another time. Communicate nothing of this letter but privately to our friend Galloway. I am your

years, violently rooted them out all over America, and are still  
acting as if it were a benefit to perpetuate the hatred of the co-  
lonists, after losing their affections. Speaking of De Guerchy,  
the French Ambassador in 1767, he says, * He is extremely  
‘ curious to inform himself in the affairs of America ; pretends  
‘to have a great esteem for me, on account of the abilities

French court should have paid no more attention to this  
controversy from 1763 to 1775. It is true, we are informed  
by Dr. F ranklin, that he was visited by the French minister  
at London in 1767, and that he was very inquisitive in relation
