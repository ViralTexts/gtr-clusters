 in Conversation with him on the Subject. He was very urgent with me to stay in England and prevail with you to remove hither with Sally. He propos’d several advantageous Schemes to me which appear’d reasonably founded. His Family is a very agreable one; Mrs. Strahan a sensible [and] good Woman, the Children of amiable [char]acters and particularly the young Man, [who is] sober, ingenious and industrious, and a [desirable] Person. In Point of Circumstances [there can] be no Objection, Mr. Strahan being [in so thriving] a Way, as to lay up a Thousand [Pounds] every Year from the Profits of his Business, after maintaining his Family and paying all Charges. I gave him, however, two Reasons why I could not think of removing hither. One, my Affection to Pensilvania, and long established Friendships and other Connections there: The other, your invincible Aversion to crossing the Seas.

In his first visit to London, his friend Wil-  
liam Strahan “was very urgent with me to  
stay in England, and prevail with you to re-  
move hither with Sally. He proposed sev-  
eral advantageous schemes to me, which  
appeared reasonably founded. . . . I gave  
him, however, two reasons why I could not  
think of removing hither: one my affection  
to Pennsylvania, and long established friend-  
ships and other connexions there; the other,  
your invincible aversion to crossing the  
seas.”
