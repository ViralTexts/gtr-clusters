Editing a Paper is a pleasant business—if you like it.  
  
If it contains much political matter people won&#x27;t have it.  
  
If the type is large it don&#x27;t contain much reading matter.  
  
If we publish telegraph reports, folks say they are nothing but lies.  
  
If we omit them they say we have no enterprise, or suppress them for political effect.  
  
If we have a few jokes, folks say we are nothing but rattle heads.  
  
If we omit jokes, folks say we are nothing but old fossils.  
  
If we publish original matters, they damn us for not giving selections.  
  
If we give selections, people say we are lazy for not writing more and giving them what they have not read in some other paper.  
  
If we give a complimentary notice, we are censured for being partial.  
  
If we don&#x27;t all hands say we are a great hog.  
  
If we insert an article which pleases the ladies, the men become jealous, and *vice versa*.   
  
If we attend church they say it for effect.  
  
If we remain in our office, attending to our own business, folks say we are too proud to mingle with our fellows.  
  
If we got out, they say we don&#x27;t attend to our business.  
  
If we don&#x27;t pay up promptly, they say we are not to be trusted.  
  
If we pay up promptly, they say we stole the money.—Hobart Journal.

say that the sins of his life, though many  
and scarlet, were not wiped away when  
at last he makes the dumb confession of  
faith in God among strangers, and asks  
a woman to pray for him for his mother’s  
sake. Amid all the mysterious mazes  
which science attempts to weave about  
Chistian hope; through the dark clouds  
of doubt that unbelievers roll across the  
skies, shines the sweet star of that sim  
pie faith, learned at a mother’s knee of  
long ago, which abides with us always,  
and at last supports us with its glorious  
promises of eternal joy and peace.

and incompetence and briugs the most  
skilled and expert mechanic down to  
the level of the least fit. The true  
theory is to pay the workman for what  
he does, not for the time occupied iu  
doing it. In this way skill will be  
stimulated and industry rewarded.  
This method, too, will have the effect  
of removing from the trades unions a
