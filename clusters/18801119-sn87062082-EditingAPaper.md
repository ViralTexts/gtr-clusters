Editing a Paper is a pleasant business—if you like it.  
  
If it contains much political matter people won&#x27;t have it.  
  
If the type is large it don&#x27;t contain much reading matter.  
  
If we publish telegraph reports, folks say they are nothing but lies.  
  
If we omit them they say we have no enterprise, or suppress them for political effect.  
  
If we have a few jokes, folks say we are nothing but rattle heads.  
  
If we omit jokes, folks say we are nothing but old fossils.  
  
If we publish original matters, they damn us for not giving selections.  
  
If we give selections, people say we are lazy for not writing more and giving them what they have not read in some other paper.  
  
If we give a complimentary notice, we are censured for being partial.  
  
If we don&#x27;t all hands say we are a great hog.  
  
If we insert an article which pleases the ladies, the men become jealous, and *vice versa*.   
  
If we attend church they say it for effect.  
  
If we remain in our office, attending to our own business, folks say we are too proud to mingle with our fellows.  
  
If we got out, they say we don&#x27;t attend to our business.  
  
If we don&#x27;t pay up promptly, they say we are not to be trusted.  
  
If we pay up promptly, they say we stole the money.—Hobart Journal.

they say that is easily done; that the evidence  
of a good editor is in selections. If we scissor  
a great deal, we are cursed for not giving them  
what has not appeared in some other paper.  
A complimentary notice appears, and we arc  
called partial; and if none is written, we are  
styled a selfish hog. If we occasionally publish  
something to please the ear of young ladies,  
or tickle the fancy of young misses, men damn  
the paper for printing such &quot;trash,&quot; and if  
nothing is given for the ladies, the paper is not |  
fit to have in the house. If we attend church  
it is to cover our hypocrisy; and if we fail to go,  
we are condemned for not practising what we  
preach. If we commend any act of the Government,  
men declare we dare not speak otherwise;  
and if we do see tit to sometimes find  
fault, there is a class to call us a traitor. If we  
denounce a General for want of capacity, we  
are impairing confidence; and if we make no

I lifted the wasted frame and moistened  
the poor boy&#x27;s parched lips and tongue

stood on the window-sill. He felt the  
cool hand on his brow, and his mind

t as you would the  
blackguard himself—in silence. That  
our aims and objects are good is no  
reason why our members should be  
regarded as beings of superior build  
or material. We are no more the  
salt of the earth than the millions of  
unknown toilers who do the work of  
the world. In our dealings with la­  
borers and capitalists we must deal  
justly and fairly by them. If wa  
would have it equally done to us, we  
in turn must do equally to others.  
Such a sensible, fair-minded, pro­  
gressive man is worthy the chief mag­  
istracy of the Nation. And he may at­  
tain it before he grows much older,  
because the Knights of Labor are

Whereas, the annoyance of dogs

farms has become past endurance on  
account of the trampling down of  
grain, injury to shocks and stacks,  
and general lawless disregard of the

Now, therefore.be it resolved, that

all reasonable endeavors to secure the  
conviction of any and all offenders.  
  
Resolved, that the town clerk be in­  
structed to publish these resolutions  
in the Morris papers during the last

1886, and to post copies of these reso­

to our business.  
We must work harder, more hours in  
a day, with less recration, on less sleep  
and poorer pay, than any of our fellow  
mortals.. We must be busy when our  
neighbors are idle, busier when they  
sleep and busiest while they are enjoying  
a good time.  
  
We must be always in a hurry, always

a paper for $1.50 in advance (possibly)  
that costs $3, and wait for our pay till a  
collector has gotten his commission for  
collecting it.

Mutual Life is one of the companies  
which it is claimed is liable on the  
Hilluion claims, and Commissioner  
MoXnll refused to grunt it a license  
ou theground that the claim had not  
been paid. Judge Williams said in  
his opinion that such action was  
arbitrary, &quot;the assumption of auth­  
ority in a ministerial officer that is  
startling.&#x27;&#x27; The attorney I&#x27;orMcNoll  
gave notice that the ease will be ap­  
pealed to the United States Supreme  
Court.

What Editing a Paper Is.  
Editing; a paper is pleasant—if you  
like it.  
If the type is large it doesn&#x27;t con­  
tain much rending matter.  
If we omit jokes, folks say we are  
nothing but fossils.  
If we publish original matter, they  
blame ns for not giving selections.  
if we give selections, people say we  
are lazy for not writing more, and  
giving (hem what they have read in  
some other paper.  
If wo give complimentary notices,  
we are censured for being partial.  
If we don&#x27;t,everybody says we are  
unjust.  
If we remain in our office attend­  
ing to our business, folks say we are  
too proud to mingle with our fel­  
lows.  
if we go out they sac we don’t at­  
tend to our business.—Ex
