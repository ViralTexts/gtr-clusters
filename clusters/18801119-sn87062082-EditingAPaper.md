Editing a Paper is a pleasant business—if you like it.  
  
If it contains much political matter people won&#x27;t have it.  
  
If the type is large it don&#x27;t contain much reading matter.  
  
If we publish telegraph reports, folks say they are nothing but lies.  
  
If we omit them they say we have no enterprise, or suppress them for political effect.  
  
If we have a few jokes, folks say we are nothing but rattle heads.  
  
If we omit jokes, folks say we are nothing but old fossils.  
  
If we publish original matters, they damn us for not giving selections.  
  
If we give selections, people say we are lazy for not writing more and giving them what they have not read in some other paper.  
  
If we give a complimentary notice, we are censured for being partial.  
  
If we don&#x27;t all hands say we are a great hog.  
  
If we insert an article which pleases the ladies, the men become jealous, and *vice versa*.   
  
If we attend church they say it for effect.  
  
If we remain in our office, attending to our own business, folks say we are too proud to mingle with our fellows.  
  
If we got out, they say we don&#x27;t attend to our business.  
  
If we don&#x27;t pay up promptly, they say we are not to be trusted.  
  
If we pay up promptly, they say we stole the money.—Hobart Journal.
