A SINGULAR VEGETABLE SKELETON.—A singular story is told of an apple tree planted over the grave of Roger Williams. This tree had pushed downward one of its main roots in a sloping direction, and nearly straight course, toward the precise spot that had been occupied by the skull of Roger Williams. There making a turn conforming with the circumference, the root followed the direction of the back-bone to the hips, and thence divided into two branches, each one following the leg bone to the heel, where they both turned upwards to the extremities of the toes of the skeleton. One of the roots formed a slight crook at the part occupied by the knee joint, thus producing an increased resemblance to the outlines of the skeleton of Roger Williams, as if, indeed, moulded thereto by the powers of vegetable life.

a prayer. While in the midst of it, one of  
company discovered &quot;the color&quot; in the earth  
at his teet, thrown up to make room for the  
remains of the deceased. In a loud whisper  
he communicated the rather exciting intelli­

opened his eyes to see the auditory scatter in  
every direction to stake off gold claims. Cal­

A Singular Story —A singular story is  
told of the apple tree planted over the grave  
of Roger Williams. This tree had pushed  
downward one of its main roots in a sloping i  
direction, and nearly straight course, to­  
wards the precise spot that had been occu­  
pied by the skull of Roger Williams. There,  
making a turn conforming with its circum­  
ference, the root followed the direction of  
the back-bone to the hips,and thence divided  
into two branches, each one following a leg­  
bone to the heel, where they both turned  
upward to the extremities of the toes of the  
skeleton. One of the roots formed a slight  
crook at the part occupied by the knee-joint,  
thus producing an increased resemblance to  
the outlines of the skeleton of Roger Will­  
iams, as if, indeed, moulded thereto by the  
power of vegetable life. This singularl

A Remarkable Story.  
A singular story is told of an apple­  
tree planted over the grave of Roger  
Williams, this tree had pushed down­  
ward one of its main roots in a sloping  
direction, and in a nearly &quot;straight  
course, toward the precise spot that in&#x27;

Williams. There, by making a turn  
conforming with its circumference, the  
root followed the direction of the back­  
bone unto the hips, and thence divided  
into two branches, each one following a  
leg-bone to the heel, where the&quot;y both  
turned upward to the extremities of  
the toes of the skeleton. One of the  
roots formed a slight crook at the part  
occupied by the kneejoint, thus pro­
